<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages have been written with the view
of presenting a general and connected sketch of the
history of Christian Education down to the period
of the Council of Trent, illustrated from the lives of
those who have, in successive ages, taken part in that
great work. A subject extending over so wide a field
could of necessity be only partially treated, and it
seems desirable, therefore, to explain certain omissions
which might otherwise cause disappointment. It was
believed that the object aimed at would, in most cases,
be better accomplished by introducing the reader to
the teachers themselves, than by undertaking to give
a complete account and critical examination of their
writings. Such an examination would properly enter
into a history of Christian Literature, a grand <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desideratum</i>
indeed, but one which the present volumes
makes no pretensions to supply. Again, for obvious
reasons, the philosophical and theological controversies
connected with the lives of the great men
who form the subjects of the following studies, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[Pg vi]</span>
been designedly touched on with the greatest possible
brevity: the history of such controversies seeming to
belong to Ecclesiastical History, and to be unsuitable
in a work like the present.</p>

<p>It has been the wish of the writer to treat the
subject from a purely historical point of view, and
to increase the value of the narrative by, as far as
possible, preserving the colouring, and sometimes
even the very language, of the original historians.</p>

<p>The notes appended to the text will give a general
idea of the authorities whence the matter has been
derived. The Ecclesiastical Histories of Fleury and
Rohrbacher have furnished the groundwork of the
general narrative. In the account of the Irish schools,
the chronology and the main facts have been drawn
from Lanigan’s Ecclesiastical History of Ireland.
The sketch of the restoration of letters under
Charlemagne has been chiefly taken from Crevier’s
<cite>Histoire de l’Université de Paris</cite>, Launoy’s Treatise
<cite>De Scholis Celebrioribus</cite>, and the various lives, both
ancient and modern, of Charlemagne. In the chapters
referring to the subsequent history of the Dark Ages,
constant use has been made of the <cite>Acta Sanctorum
Ord. S. Benedicti</cite>, by D’Achery and Mabillon, and of
the collections of the Lives of the Saints by Surius
and the Bollandists; also of the <cite>Vetera Analecta</cite> of
Mabillon, the <cite>Spicilegium</cite> of D’Achery, the <cite>Amplissima
Collectio</cite> of Martene, and the <cite>Histoire Litteraire de la
France</cite>, by the Benedictines of St. Maur. Much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
valuable matter has also been derived from the <cite>Monumenta
Germaniæ Historica</cite> of Pertz, and the collection
of ancient German Chronicles by Meibomius; the
account of the school and scholars of St. Gall’s being
taken from Ekkehard’s History <cite>De Casibus S. Galli</cite>,
printed in the first volume of Goldasti’s collection, and
from the Benedictine Life of B. Notker. The notices
of the foreign universities are chiefly drawn from
Crevier, and from Tiraboschi’s <cite>Storia della Letteratura
Italiana</cite>, which latter work has been almost
exclusively used in the chapters on the Renaissance
in Italy. The chapter on the Dominicans and the
Universities is compiled from a considerable number
of authorities; chiefly, Touron’s <cite>Vies des Hommes
Illustres</cite>, the <cite>Scriptores Ordinis Prædicatorum</cite> by
Echard and Quetil, the French translation of Dr.
Sighart’s <cite>Life of Albert the Great</cite>, and the <cite>Constitutions
of the Order</cite>.</p>

<p>The sketches of our English schools and universities
are mostly derived from Wood’s <cite>Antiquities of Oxford</cite>,
Ayliffe’s <cite>Ancient and Present State of the University
of Oxford</cite>, and Dugdale’s <cite>Monasticon</cite>; whilst various
notices of early English scholars have been gathered
from Wright’s <cite>Biographia Britannica</cite>, Warton’s
<cite>History of English Poetry</cite>, and the original lives of
the English Saints, as given in the three collections
already named. Hallam’s <cite>Literary History of Europe</cite>,
and Ranke’s <cite>History of the Popes</cite>, have also been
made considerable use of in treating of the period of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
the Renaissance, while the sketches of Colet and Pole
have been drawn from their respective lives by
Knight and Philipps. Pallavicini’s <cite>History of the
Council of Trent</cite>, and Touron’s <cite>Life of St. Charles
Borromeo</cite>, have furnished the chief materials for the
concluding chapter of the work.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 60 to 543.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the seventh year of the Emperor Nero, and the sixtieth of the
Christian era, a little ship entered the harbour of Alexandria, and
after rounding the great Pharos that stood at its northern extremity,
cast anchor by that granite quay, round which was grouped, as in
an amphitheatre, six miles in span, a city of palaces and temples.
It bore on its decks one of whom that proud city as yet knew
nothing, but who had come to erect his patriarchal throne in the
midst of her sea girt walls, bringing with him his Gospel and the
sovereignty of St. Peter’s keys. It was St. Mark, the interpreter and
spiritual son of the Prince of the Apostles, sent in his name and by
his authority to plant the Church in the southern capital of the
Empire. Descending from the ship, and crossing the crowded quay
overshadowed by its plane-trees, he made his way towards the great
Moon-gate which opened into the street of the Seven Stadia. He
was partially bald, and his hair and beard were sprinkled with grey
hairs; but his beautiful eyes flashed beneath their high arched eyebrows,
and there was a quickness in his step and a grace in his
movements which bespoke him not yet past the middle age.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> So at
least he has been described by the historian Simeon Metaphrastes,
who, though writing in the tenth century, has embodied in his narrative
the account of far earlier authors, who have minutely recorded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the circumstances which attended the entry into Alexandria of her
first patriarch.</p>

<p>We need not describe the world in which he found himself. It
was the fairest city of the East; Greek in its aspect and population
though planted on Egyptian soil, with a clearer sky than even that
of Athens; a nobler harbour than Corinth could boast of; and that
which was denied to Rome and Carthage, the command of a mighty
river, which brought down to the port the corn and rose-coloured
granite of Upper Egypt, the ivory of Ethiopia, the spices and gold-dust
of Arabia, and the gems of Eastern lands. Like that other
more ancient city on whose site she was reared, she “dwelt in the
midst of the rivers; the sea was her riches, the waters were her
walls.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Then as now the highway to India lay through Egypt, and
her seaport of Arsinoe on the Arabian Gulf communicated by a canal
with the Nile, the western branch of which flowed out into the
Mediterranean just north of the Alexandrian harbour. Thus the
capital of the Ptolemies became the central point between East and
West, and into her markets flowed the costly Oriental luxuries which
were carried by her merchants into every European port. She was
rich and she was populous; all nations met to traffic in her harbour,
all tongues were spoken in her “many-peopled” streets. Yet her
trading pre-eminence formed but a small part of her glory. It is not
often that a great commercial emporium becomes the haunt of the
Muses; but Alexandria united graces and attractions of the most
opposite character, and her fame for learning eclipsed even that
of her wealth. Three hundred years before the time of which we
are speaking, one of Alexander’s royal successors, after erecting the
temple of Serapis and the great Pharos, which last was numbered
among the wonders of the world, bethought him of another way of
rendering his name immortal, and gathered together a society of
learned men whose duty was to consist in studying and teaching
every known science. He built schools for them to lecture in, halls
in which they ate in common, and marble porticoes, where, after the
fashion of the Greek philosophers, they could walk and converse
with their disciples. A noble library, which was enlarged by successive
princes till it consisted of seven hundred thousand volumes,
completed the Musæum or University of Ptolemy Soter, and the
whole was joined to his own palace and delicious gardens by stately
marble colonnades. Royal patronage was scarcely needed to foster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
the intellectual life of a city which had been designed by its founder
to be the capital of the world; but with such encouragement the
schools of Alexandria grew apace, and in the Apostolic age ranked
as the first within the wide dominions that owned the Roman sway.</p>

<p>Here then the Blessed Peter came in the person of his chosen
disciple, to claim for Christ the southern capital of the Empire, as
he had already in his own person taken possession of East and West&mdash;of
Antioch and Rome. Solitary and unknown, the Evangelist
came there bent on conquests vaster than those of Alexander, for he
had but enslaved a base material world; but St. Mark, as he stood
at the Mendion, or Moon-gate, that led from the harbour into the
busy streets, was deliberating on the conquest of a million of souls.
How was he to begin? Where should he first bear his message of
good tidings? Should he bend his steps to the porticoes of the
Musæum, or try to find a listener in the crowded exchange which
met his eye through that open gate? Providence itself was to give
the reply, and neither wealth nor science was to yield him his first
convert. The thong of his sandal snapped in two, and to get it
mended he entered the shop of a cobbler that stood close at hand.
The cobbler, whose name was Anianus, gave him hospitality that
night; and questioning him as to who he was, heard in reply that he
was the servant of Jesus Christ, declared in the Scriptures to be the
Son of God. “Of what Scriptures do you speak?” he inquired; “I
have never heard of any writings but the Iliad and the Odyssey, and
other such things as are taught to the sons of the Egyptians.” Then
St. Mark sat down and unfolded to him the Gospel; through the
long hours of the night, in the midst of that heaving world of idolatry
and sin&mdash;the teacher spoke, and the disciple listened; and when
morning dawned the first fruits of Alexandria had been laid up in
the garner of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It was meet that an Evangelist should deliver his first message to
the poor; but it was not with the poor alone that he had to do.
The Church of Alexandria was to receive into her embrace the philosopher
of the Musæum as well as the despised Egyptian slave. She
was to address herself to the wise and prudent of this world as well
as to little ones. So St. Mark, as we are told, surrounded his see
with learned men, and became the founder of a catechetical school.
Although its chief celebrity dates only from the end of the second
century, yet its first foundation is universally attributed to St. Mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>It rose under the shadow of the temple of Serapis, near those
marble porticoes where the Neo-Platonists, who despised such vulgar
idolatry, were dreaming of some misty impersonal abstraction to
which they gave the name of God; where Pyrrhonists took refuge in
a system of universal doubt; where many were content to know
nothing at all about the soul, and concerned themselves rather with
mathematics and material prosperity; where Greek Epicureans talked
of a world that had made itself by chance, and set up sense as the
standard of certainty, and enjoyment as the end of life; while Roman
freethinkers quoted the witty atheisms of Lucretius, and then went
to burn incense before the statue of the Emperor. What new
elements of knowledge could a Christian Evangelist contribute to
such a world as this? There was no need for him to bring it the
literature of Greece and Rome; and as to the sciences of figures
and numbers, Egypt was their native soil. Even the Hebrew Scriptures
had long ago been translated into Greek and laid up in the
library of Ptolemy. But he brought the Gospel&mdash;his own Gospel in
particular;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the one Book out of which for long ages the faithful of
Alexandria were exclusively instructed, and which the teacher of the
catechetical school was required to hold in his hand when he stood
before his hearers. He brought the traditions of St. Paul and of
St. Peter, for he had been the disciple of both. He brought the
Creed, the Apostolic symbol, which in the brief compass of its twelve
articles contains more truths than Plato or Cicero had ever known,
and which discovered in the certainty of faith that <em>Eureka</em> which every
system of human philosophy had sought in vain. He brought his
Liturgy too; if not that which bears his name, at least some earlier
form which served as its groundwork. And lastly, he brought that
Liturgy’s musical voice&mdash;the eight ancient tones, which, like so many
things that belong to the Church, when first we meet with them in
history, are already clothed with venerable antiquity: those tones to
which the Jewish Church had for centuries chanted the Psalms of
David; which must so often have fallen on the ears of Jesus, and in
whose melody, it may be, His Divine Voice had sometimes mingled;
the sweet songs of Sion which Jewish captives had sung by the rivers of
Babylon, and whose echoes now floated from Christian lips over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
dark waters of the Nile.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The Holy Gospels, the Creed, the Liturgy,
and the Ecclesiastical Chant, these were the contributions which were
offered by the Patriarch of Alexandria to her learned stores, and
which formed the first class-books of the Christian schools. But
St. Mark did something more than this. All early writers agree in
declaring that he established among his clergy that canonical rule
of life which was a copy of the community life of the first Christians;
while at the same time, <ins class="corr" id="tn5" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Second Footnote 1 changed to Footnote 2 after as St. Jerome and Cassian”.">as St. Jerome and Cassian</ins><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> inform us, some
of his disciples retiring into the neighbourhood of the city, and there
giving themselves up to prayer and the study of the Scriptures, laid
the first foundations of the cœnobitical, or monastic life.</p>

<p>To St. Mark, therefore, and through him to the Prince of the
Apostles, may be traced up every one of those institutions which
were the nurseries of the Christian schools. For, as will hereafter
be seen, the Christian seminaries took their origin in the episcopal
and monastic schools, and these again grew out of that system of
community life which, being first embraced by the faithful at Jerusalem,
was afterwards elsewhere established by the Apostles, who
lived with their immediate followers as they themselves had lived
with their Divine Master. The Apostolic origin of the canonical
rule of life has never been denied. When St. Augustine was accused
by Petilianus the Donatist of introducing a novelty into the Church
by establishing his community of regular clergy, he defended himself
by appealing to the example of the first Christians, and showing
that, if the name of monastery were new, the manner of life which
he and his brethren followed was as old as Christianity itself. It is
thus that the author of the ancient book called the “Recognitions”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
describes St. Peter as living, with a chosen number of disciples,
among whom were St. Mark, St. Clement, St. Evodius, and St.
Linus; so St. Paul was accompanied by St. Luke and St. Timothy,
and St. John the Evangelist by St. Polycarp and St. Papias. St.
Irenæus, a disciple of the last-named saints, carried into Gaul the
discipline of the school in which he had been nurtured, and, writing
in after years to the heresiarch Florinus, reminds him how, when
yet a child, he had been accustomed to meet him in the house of
Polycarp. “Early recollections,” he says, “grow with the soul, and
entwine themselves about it, so that I could tell of the very place
where the blessed Polycarp sat when he spoke, of his employments
and his external appearance.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Out of this manner of life, as we shall presently show, sprang up
the episcopal seminaries, which were designed for the training of
the younger clerics, whilst the catechetical schools were intended for
the religious instruction of the neophytes. But though this last-named
institution was, of course, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, and exclusively belonged
to those primitive ages when adult converts from Paganism had to
be prepared for baptism by at least a two years’ course of instruction,
yet their history, and specially that of the Alexandrian school,
helps us in a convenient manner to watch the absorption into the
Christian system of education of every branch of learning afterwards
cultivated in the schools.</p>

<p>In the absence of more particular details of the kind of instruction
which prevailed at Alexandria before the time of St. Pantænus, we
may reasonably suppose that the same system was adopted in that
city as we find established at Jerusalem under St. Cyril. There the
<em>Hearers</em> or Catechumens assembled in the porch of the church; the
men and women sat separate from one another, and the master
stood to deliver his instruction. The catecheses of St. Cyril that
are preserved are twenty-three in number, eighteen being a summary
of the chief articles of the Faith, given in the form of an exposition
of the Creed, and the five others intended for the <em>competent</em>, or those
preparing to receive the Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and
the Holy Eucharist. The last-named subject is treated in an explanation
of the Liturgy of St. James. This, of course, was the sort of
teaching for which the catechetical schools were primarily intended,
and up to the year 179 the teachers of Alexandria do not appear to
have aimed at anything of a higher character. But about that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Pantænus, a former stoic, whose eloquence earned him the title of
<em>the Sicilian Bee</em>, became master of the school, and introduced a
wider range of studies. He made use of his old learning to illustrate
and defend his new faith. Clement of Alexandria, his earliest
disciple, speaks of his “transcendent powers,” and St. Alexander,
Bishop of Jerusalem, gloried in calling him his lord and blessed
father.</p>

<p>The renown of St. Pantænus passed into the Indies, carried
thither by some of the swarthy Hindoos, who were no strangers in
the busy streets of Alexandria, and who had managed to find their
way to that school where Jew and Gentile, bond and free, met
together without distinction. The Indians invited him to come
among them, and St. Pantænus accordingly exchanged his mastership
for an apostolic life, and went to preach the faith to the Brahmins.
Clement, his former disciple and assistant, succeeded him. He had
visited all lands and studied in all schools in search of truth, and
had found it at last on the humble bench of the Catechumen. No
one understood better than he the emptiness of human learning
when pursued as an end, or its serviceableness when used as a
means. His end was to win souls to Christ; and to reach it, he
laid hands indifferently on all the intellectual weapons that fell
within his reach; poetry and philosophy, science and even satire;&mdash;he
neglected nothing that would serve his turn. He did not disdain
to give a Christian interpretation to Pagan fables, and took occasion
from the stories of Orpheus and Amphion, who, as the poets pretended,
had moved the stones and tamed the wild beasts with the
music of their lyres, to present to his hearers the Word made Flesh,
conquering the stony and ferocious heart of fallen man, and restoring
that universe which he beautifully calls “a lyre whose harmony has
been destroyed by sin.” He could use with equal ease the phraseology
of the Neo-Platonists whilst engaged in dispersing their transcendentalism
into thinnest air, or the plainer language of the Gospel
when he had to put heretics to silence. Nor was he too deep or
profound for the comprehension of the simple-hearted faithful; he
could write hymns for little children to sing in church, and when
he spoke to exclusively Christian hearers set forth no other wisdom,
no other model for their imitation, than “Jesus Christ and Him
Crucified.”</p>

<p>The result of all this may be imagined. While the first neophytes
of St. Mark and his immediate followers had been chiefly gained from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the ranks of the Jews, to whom Alexandria was a second home, Gentile
converts now flowed into the Church in ever-increasing numbers.
The philosophers found in the Christian teachers those who could
beat them with their own weapons, and human learning became
elevated and ennobled by its marriage with the faith. It may be
taken as a proof how thoroughly it was now recognised that Christians
were men who could think and reason like other men, had as
fair a knowledge of books and as great a command of what the Roman
world valued far more than mere book-knowledge&mdash;eloquence; in
short, that they were men of whom a university city need not be
ashamed, and who might even be capable one day or other of setting
up a university of their own&mdash;that it was becoming possible for
Christians to gain a livelihood by teaching grammar and profane
letters. There was one who so began his career, and who, at the
age of eighteen, succeeded Clement in the direction of the catechetical
school. The child of a martyr, Origen had been the pupil of
saints. He had been taught not only by Clement, but also by
St. Hyppolitus the martyr, commonly called Bishop of Porto, the
disciple of Irenæus, the disciple of Polycarp, the spiritual son of the
Apostle St. John. Hyppolitus was a man of many sciences, a philosopher,
a poet, and a mathematician. He was one of the earliest who
comes before us as attaining eminence in that distinctively Christian
science, which will often appear in these pages under the name of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Computum</i>. The computum was in fact the art of calculating
the time of Easter, and included so much astronomical and arithmetical
knowledge as was necessary for that purpose.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Hence it was
a science indispensable in the education of clerics; for in those days
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabula Paschalis</i> did not as now figure at the beginning of every
Prayer-book; nor did the invention of almanacs bring home much
science in a simple form to the fireside of the most unlettered layman.
The calculation of Easter, therefore, had to be painfully gone
through year after year, to the sore travail of many heads; and he
was a benefactor to his species who first thought of lightening the
labour. Hyppolitus, who is supposed to have been an Alexandrian
by birth, and to whom, therefore, astronomy and arithmetic were
second nature, composed two cycles which determined the Easter
for a hundred and twelve years to come; and after his death a statue
was erected representing the bishop, with the cycles engraved on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
chair, which is still preserved in the Christian Museum of the
Lateran.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Under Hyppolitus and the other masters provided for him by his
father’s care, Origen had made progress in every human science;
but on becoming chief catechist of Alexandria he had to make a
sacrifice. He was forced to resign his grammar-school and to sell
his books. Not, indeed, that he had no further need of these
treasures, but they were his solitary riches; and as even he could not
absolutely live on nothing, he parted from them and lived on the
small pension of four oboli a day, which was paid him by the purchaser.
And having thus wedded himself to poverty, alike the
spouse of the scholar and the saint, he began to study Hebrew, and
entered on those vast labours which had for their object the production
of a correct version of the Sacred Text. And all the time the
business of the school went on, and persecution raged with small
intermission. Seven of his disciples suffered under Severus&mdash;a glorious
crown for the master who envied them their palms. But we are
only concerned with the history of Origen in so far as it exhibits the
expansion of the Christian studies. So passing over twenty years of
his life, we shall follow him to Cæsarea, where in 231 he retired from
the storm that had driven him from Alexandria, and accepted the
direction of another school entrusted him by the two bishops, Theoctistus
of Cæsarea and Alexander of Jerusalem. It appears to have
been a combination of the episcopal seminary and the catechetical
school, for scholars of all classes resorted to it. Among them were
Theodore, better known by his Christian name of St. Gregory
Thaumaturgus, and his brother Athenodorus, who were then studying
in the famous law-schools of Berytus. The conversation of
Origen, however, soon put Roman jurisprudence out of their heads,
and determined them to apply exclusively to philosophy under the
guidance of their new friend. Both were at this time pagans, and
Origen had to prepare their minds to receive the truth in a very
gradual manner. He began by mercilessly rooting out the weeds
and briars of bad habits and false maxims which he found choking
up the soil, a process which at first, as his pupils acknowledged, cost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
them not a little. Then he taught them in succession the different
branches of philosophy: logic, in order to exercise their minds and
enable them to discern true reasoning from sophistry; physics, that
they might understand and admire the works of God; geometry,
which by its clear and indisputable demonstrations serves as a basis
to the science of thought; astronomy, to lift their hearts from earth
to heaven; and finally, philosophy, which was not limited like that
taught in the pagan schools to empty speculations, but was conveyed
in such a way as to lead to practical results. All these were but
steps to ascend to that higher science which teaches us the existence
and nature of God. He permitted his pupils freely to read whatever
the poets and philosophers had written on this subject, himself
watching and directing their studies, and opening their eyes to distinguish
those sparks of truth which are to be found scattered in the
writings of the pagans, however overlaid by a mass of fable. And
then at last he presented them with the Sacred Scriptures, in which
alone the true knowledge of God is to be found. In one of his
letters to St. Gregory he explains in what way he wishes him to regard
the profane sciences. “They are to be used,” he says, “so that
they may contribute to the understanding of the Scriptures; for just
as philosophers are accustomed to say that geometry, music,
grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy all dispose us to the study of
philosophy, so we may say that philosophy, rightly studied, disposes
us to the study of Christianity. We are permitted when we go out
of Egypt to carry with us the riches of the Egyptians wherewith to
adorn the tabernacle; only let us beware how we reverse the process,
and leave Israel to go down into Egypt and seek for treasure:
that is what Jeroboam did in old time, and what heretics do in our
own.”</p>

<p>In addition, therefore, to the elements of education which have
been named before, we see that, at the beginning of the third century,
Christians were expected to teach and study the liberal arts,
profane literature, philosophy, and the Biblical languages. Their
teachers commented on the Scriptures, and devoted themselves to
a critical study of its text; positive theology, as it is called, had
established itself in the schools, together with a certain systematic
science of Christian ethics, and, we may add, many branches of
physical science also. It matters very little that these latter were
but imperfectly known; the real point worth observing is, that every
branch of human knowledge, in so far as it had been cultivated at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
that time, was included in the studies of the Christian schools; and,
considering that this had been the work of scarcely more than two
centuries, and those centuries of bloody persecution, it must be
acknowledged to have been a tolerably expansive growth.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the gradual development of the episcopal
seminaries, which in their early stage formed but a part of the
bishop’s household. I have already spoken of the sort of community
life established among the bishops and their clergy in apostolic
times. During the first four centuries of the Church this manner of
life was the more easily carried out, as the clergy were to be found
only in towns. The establishment of rural parishes and the appointment
of parochial priests to country villages, is first spoken of in the
Council of Vaison, held in 528. The community life of the city
clergy had many obvious advantages, and afforded singular facilities
for training younger aspirants to the ecclesiastical state under the eye
of the chief pastor. Accordingly, we very early find notices of the
schools for younger clerics, which sprang up in the episcopal households.
Thus, the martyr St. Vincent is stated to have been educated
in sacred letters, even from his childhood, by Valerius, Bishop of
Saragossa. St. John Chrysostom studied for three years as lector in
the household of Meletius, Bishop of Antioch, St. Cyril in that of
his uncle Theophilus, and St. Athanasius with Alexander of Alexandria.
Towards the close of the second century we read how Pope
St. Eleutherius placed the future martyr St. Felicianus in the school
which was then presided over by his archdeacon, St. Victor,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> his
successor in the Apostolic Chair; and all the early annals of the
Roman Church represent her clergy as for the most part educated
in this manner, under the eye of her Pontiffs. The author of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philosophumena</i> acquaints us with the fact that Pope Calixtus I.
established a school of theology at Rome, which appears from his
account to have been crowded with disciples. When, after the conversion
of Constantine, the imperial palace of the Lateran became
the residence of the popes, their ecclesiastical school was maintained
within the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patriarchium</i>, as the papal palace was called, and in it not
a few of the greatest popes of the first nine centuries received their
education. It possessed a noble library, and the names of its
librarians are preserved in unbroken order from the fifth century.
Here, ecclesiastical students were received at an early age, and
admitted to the successive degrees of holy orders only at long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
intervals and after careful preparation. The very first Decretal that
exists of known authenticity, that of Pope St. Siricius, addressed,
in 385, to Himerius, Bishop of Tarragona, lays down the rules to be
observed in promoting clerics to holy orders, and indicates the existence
of such episcopal seminaries as we have described. <em>Those
who have been devoted to the service of the Church from childhood</em> are
to be first placed in the rank of lectors. Then, if they have persevered
to the age of thirty, they may be advanced through the inferior
orders to the subdiaconate, and thence to the diaconate, in which
they must pass five years before being admitted to the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
A few years later we find St. Zozimus ordaining that the young
clerics should remain in the rank of lectors till their twentieth year,
and that they should not be raised to the priesthood until after many
years of trial. St. Leo I. writes to the African bishops, about the
middle of the fifth century, appealing to the venerable ordinances of
the holy fathers on the ordination of those <em>who have lived from
childhood subject to ecclesiastical discipline</em>, by which expression we
must certainly understand the young lectors of the episcopal seminaries.
And, glancing on to the eighth and ninth centuries, we find
exactly the same discipline kept up in the school of the Patriarchium
as had existed in the seventh. Pope Gregory II. is spoken of as
brought up from childhood in the Lateran palace, “under the eye
and discipline of the Blessed Pontiff Sergius,”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as being promoted
by him to the subdiaconate, and after having for some years discharged
the offices of treasurer and librarian, being advanced to the
rank of deacon and, subsequently, of priest. So, too, Pope Leo III. is
described as “educated from infancy in all ecclesiastical and divine
discipline in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestiarium</i> of the Lateran Palace.” In most cases
the Lateran seminary was presided over by the Roman archdeacon,
and, as we shall see, the superintendence of the cathedral schools
continued, in after ages, to form one of the duties commonly
attached to the archdiaconate.</p>

<p>In the fourth century, when the monastic institute spread from
the East into the West, the community life of the bishops and
their clergy assumed, in many places, a yet more regular form. St.
Eusebius of Vercelli, who had himself been committed by his mother
in early youth to the care of Pope Eusebius, and had been instructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and baptized by him, was the first to erect an episcopal monastery in
his own city, which became a nursery of illustrious prelates. This
was in 354, and forty years later St. Augustine established a similar
monastery at Hippo, which is regarded as the parent of all houses
of canons regular. Yet, though these establishments are sometimes
called <em>monasteries</em>, the rule of life observed in them is ordinarily
designated the <em>Apostolic</em> rule,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the monasteries or colleges of a
similar kind established in Gaul and Britain are said to be “of the
Apostolic Order.” From this time the community life of the clergy
became subject to fixed rules or canons. In 398 the fourth Council
of Carthage, whilst prescribing the laws for the administration of
holy orders, regulates the manner of life to be observed by the
bishops with their clergy in very precise terms. The bishop is to
have his residence near the church; he is to commit the care of
temporalities to his archdeacon, and to occupy himself exclusively
with prayer, study and preaching. In the church he is to have a
higher seat than his clergy, but in the house he must recognise them
as in all respects his colleagues, and never to suffer them to remain
standing while he is seated.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Similar canons were passed in the
first Council of Toledo, held two years later.</p>

<p>In all this there is no distinct reference to the education
of the younger clerics as forming one of the duties of the cathedral
clergy. The Council of Vaison, held in 528, speaks, indeed, of the
parish priests, who are required, according to the practice of the
priests of Italy, to bring up young lectors in their houses, who may
succeed them in their cure; and the establishment of similar schools
was solemnly ordered, in 680, by the General Council of Constantinople;
but the institution, of which we here see the germ,
was not the episcopal, but the priest’s or parochial school. However,
in 531, the second Council of Toledo passed several canons,
which bear distinct reference to the bishop’s seminary, which by
this time is evidently supposed to be attached to the cathedral
church. Those children who are destined by their parents for the
ecclesiastical state are to receive the tonsure, and to be placed in the
rank of lectors in order to be instructed <em>in the house of the church
under the eyes of the bishop, by him who shall be appointed over them</em>.
At the age of eighteen their vocation is to be publicly examined,
that no one may embrace the ecclesiastical state save with his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
free consent. If this be given, they may be ordained sub-deacons
at twenty and deacons at twenty-five. And clerics so educated
cannot pass to any other diocese, but owe canonical obedience to
the bishop at whose charge they have been brought up.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, is the cathedral seminary fairly established, and a few
years later we find it expanding into a noble public school. It was
St. Leander, of Seville, who first conceived the idea of establishing a
staff of professors for teaching the liberal arts in connection with his
cathedral. He directed their labours in person, and received among
his first scholars his own brother Isidore, who afterwards succeeded
him in his see. Isidore greatly extended the range of studies,
which included the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues, and all the
liberal arts, besides law and medicine. His famous <cite>Origines</cite> drawn
up for the use of this school present an encyclopedia of every known
subject, and embody several fragments of ancient authors which
would otherwise have been lost to us. The first five books treat
of Grammar, Rhetoric, Philosophy, Dialectics, Music, Geometry,
Mechanics, Astronomy, Jurisprudence, Chronology, and History.
The sixth is on the Holy Scriptures, the seventh and eighth are on
God and the Angels, the ninth on the various nations and languages
of the earth, and the remaining books treat of Etymology. But his
efforts for the promotion of Christian education did not stop here.
In 633 he presided over the fourth Council of Toledo, at which all
the bishops of Spain were required to establish seminaries in their
cathedral cities on the model of that of Seville, the study of the
three learned languages being specially enjoined. This decree was
carried into effect, and hence it is commonly said that the system of
cathedral schools took its origin in Spain.</p>

<p>Besides the catechetical and episcopal schools, instances occur,
even in the age of martyrdom, of private schools kept by Christian
teachers. Such was the school of Imola, presided over by the
martyr Cassian; and the story of his martyrdom exhibits to us the
light in which the brutal pagan school-boy regarded his master. Yet
there were cases when the hearts even of Gentile scholars were
softened by the influence of a sanctity which they comprehended
not. The exquisite story of the Eight Martyrs of Carthage, as
related in their authentic Acts, exhibits to us the pagan scholars
of the deacon Flavian obtaining his reprieve from the judge by
vehemently denying his ecclesiastical character; and when he at last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
succeeds in proving a fact which brings with it the joyful death-warrant,
his Christian disciples follow him to the place of execution
to gather up the last words of instruction from their master’s lips.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
We have a yet more particular account of the school established at
Cæsarea by the martyr St. Pamphilius. He had been educated,
as a Gentile, in the public schools of Berytus, where he attained to
great proficiency in profane science. But, on his conversion, he
became desirous of acquiring a knowledge of the Sacred Scriptures,
and for this purpose placed himself under the tuition of Pierius, the
successor of Origen in the catechetical school of Alexandria. On
his return to Syria he was ordained priest, and devoted the rest of
his life, and his wealth, to the creation of a Christian school and
library. No Florentine scholar in the age of the Renaissance had a
more passionate love of books than he. He caused them to be sent
to him from every quarter, and his library numbered no fewer than
thirty thousand volumes, many of which had been copied by his
own hand. They included the best works of the ancients, besides
those of Christian writers. Pamphilius spent the greater part of
his life in transcribing books, and both bought and wrote out an
amazing number of copies of the Holy Scriptures, which he distributed
gratis to all who desired to have them. He applied himself
with unwearied diligence to obtain a correct edition of the whole
of the Sacred Text; and, in the midst of these labours, he directed
a school of sacred learning, wherein was reared more than one
martyr.</p>

<p>The public schools of the Empire were not generally resorted to by
the faithful until after the conversion of Constantine, when Christians
were permitted to aspire to the professor’s chair. But this privilege,
great as it was, did not produce any material change in the character
of the State academies; they continued to flourish under the Christian
Cæsars as they had done under their pagan predecessors, but they
never merited to be regarded as Christian institutions. Though
both Constantine and Gratian did much to provide excellent rhetoricians
and grammarians to instruct their subjects, and though Valentinian
I. made some laudable efforts, to correct the worst abuses of
the schools, they continued to bear the stamp of their origin; and
it is a significant fact that, long after the establishment of a nominal
Christianity in the institutions of the Empire, the saint whose children
were destined to hold in their hands the future education of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
is introduced to us in the first incident of his life, flying into the
wilderness to escape the corruption of the semi-pagan schools of
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> St. Augustine has told us something of the condition of
the schools of Carthage in his time, which may probably be taken
as a fair specimen of the State gymnasia in other parts of the Empire.
The masters exercised an excessive severity with their pupils, so that,
as the saint confesses, he first began the use of prayer when yet a
child, to beg of God that He would save him from a school flogging.
His elders, and even his parents, were so used to the idea of these
punishments, “whereby labour and sorrow are multiplied to the sons
of Adam,” that they only made a jest of his sufferings. All the
sweets of Greek poetry were, he says, sprinkled with gall to him, he
being forced to learn them by “cruel terrors and stripes.” He lets
us know moreover that the wholesome admonitions of Quinctilian
were altogether neglected, and that the worst writings of the pagan
authors were placed in the hands of the scholars. In academies
where the professorial system reigned supreme, moral training was
neither given nor expected; the professors were paid for teaching
their pupils grammar and rhetoric, and, as St. Augustine remarks,
would have treated it as a greater fault to pronounce <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo</i> without
the aspirate than to hate a man. Many were pagans, like Libanius,
the master of St. Chrysostom; others were content with the smallest
possible seasoning of Christianity. They were, in short, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sophists</i>
by profession&mdash;a pragmatical race of beings whose mental horizon
hardly extended beyond the logic of Aristotle and the rules of
rhetoric. Honourable exceptions of course were to be found, such
as Marius Victorinus, who in the Julian persecution resigned his
school rather than renounce the Divine Word who maketh eloquent
the tongues of children.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But as a general rule the professors troubled
themselves very little about questions of Christian faith or ethics.
Absolute dictators of a petty circle, they were devoured by a vanity
which tainted their very eloquence, and expressed itself in such a
turgid and affected style, that, as Cicero said of one of their class, if
you wanted to be dumb for the rest of your life you had nothing to
do but to study their lectures. This vanity showed itself moreover
in perpetual squabbles and rivalries, in which the disciples took part
with their masters. New-comers were laid violent hands on by the
scholastic jackals, who would endeavour by all manner of insolence
to press them into the school of their own particular sophist, initiating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
them by burlesque and uproarious ceremonies. Thus it was
that they prepared to seize St. Basil on his first coming to Athens,
when St. Gregory of Nazianzen, who well knew how offensive such
riotous scenes would prove to one of his grave and reserved character,
interfered to protect him, and thus laid the foundation of a friendship
which has inspired some of the most exquisite pages of Christian
literature. I need not quote the well-known passage that describes
their university life: it is often cited as a model for Christian students;
yet St. Gregory does not forget to inform us that it was as difficult
for a youth to preserve his innocence in the midst of such an atmosphere
as it would be for an animal to live in the midst of fire, or for
a river to preserve its sweetness when flowing through the briny
ocean.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the circumstances of the times compelled the faithful
to resort to these academies. Many had done so even when the
professorships were exclusively in the hands of the pagans. Tertullian,
in his treatise on Idolatry, examines the lawfulness of the practice,
and decides that though it would be impossible for Christians to <em>teach</em>
in schools wherein the masters were obliged to recommend the
worship of false gods, and to take part in pagan sacrifices and ceremonies,
they might properly attend them as students, because they
could not otherwise acquire that necessary knowledge of letters which
he calls “the key of life,” and because they were perfectly free to
reject the fables to which they listened. Such an argument of course
implies the existence of very powerful safeguards on the side of faith;
and he seems to take it for granted that Christian students will imbibe
only the honey from the flowers of eloquence, and reject the poison.
The general feeling certainly was that human learning was sufficiently
necessary to justify some risks being incurred in its acquisition.
After the triumph of the Church, the most religious parents, such as
those of St. Basil, hesitated not to send their sons to the public
schools; and when the crafty attempt was made by Julian the Apostate
to close them to the Christians, and to prohibit even their private
study of pagan literature, we know how strenuously the bishops protested
against his edict, as a cruel and unheard-of tyranny. So long
as it remained in force they exerted themselves to supply the want
of the old class-books, the use of which was interdicted, by imitations
of the poets from their own pens. No one was more active in this
work than St. Gregory Nazianzen, who took up the cudgels against
his imperial schoolfellow in good earnest. “For my part,” he exclaims,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
in his fourth discourse, “I trust that every one who cares for learning
will take part in my indignation. I leave to others fortune, birth,
and every other fancied good which can flatter the imagination of
man. I value only science and letters, and regret no labour that I
have spent in their acquisition. I have preferred, and shall ever
prefer, learning to all earthly riches, and hold nothing dearer on
earth, next to the joys of heaven and the hopes of eternity.” The
decree was revoked by Valentinian at the request of St. Ambrose,
so unanimous were the Christian prelates in regarding human learning
as a treasure the possession of which the faithful were jealously
to vindicate. Even in those passages which occur in the writings of
the Fathers wherein they appear to undervalue polite studies, it is
evident that they only do so relatively, and the scholar is pretty sure
to peep out before you have turned the page. “You ask me for my
books,” writes St. Gregory to his friend Adamanthus; “have you then
turned a boy again that you are going to study rhetoric? I have long
ago laid aside such follies, for one cannot spend all one’s life in child’s
play. We must cease to lisp when we aspire to the true science, and
sacrifice to the Divine Word that frivolous eloquence which formerly
so charmed our youth. However, take my books, my dear Adamanthus&mdash;all
at least that are not devoured by the worms, or blackened
with the smoke, on the shelves where they have lain so long. Take
them, and use them well. Study the sophists thoroughly, and both
acquire and teach to others all the learning you can, provided the
fear of God reign paramount over these vanities.” But though the
Fathers, both by word and example, authorised the study of the pagan
literature, they required that it should be read with certain restrictions,
and according to what may be termed the Christian method. This
is explained by St. Basil, in a treatise he wrote on the subject for
the guidance of some young relations. He advocates the right use
of human learning, comparing the soul to a tree, which bears not
only fruit but leaves also. The fruit is truth, to be found only in the
Sacred Scriptures, but the leaves are the ornaments of literature
which cover truth and adorn it. Moses and Daniel both became
skilled in the Gentile learning before they devoted themselves to the
study of sacred science. And it is not to be doubted that the poets
and philosophers have many wise and virtuous precepts, which cannot
be too deeply engraved on our minds. Christians are engaged in a
mighty struggle, in which they should make use of everything that
can help them&mdash;poetry, philosophy, rhetoric, or the arts. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
should contemplate the Sun of Truth as it is reflected in the waters
of human literature, and then lift their eyes to gaze on it in its full
effulgence in the heavens.</p>

<p>He then goes on to cite many passages from Homer, Hesiod,
and Socrates, and other ancient writers, showing that they abound
in excellent maxims, which a Christian may very well apply to his
own benefit. A Christian student, he says, should follow the example
of the bees, who draw out honey from flowers which seem
only proper to charm the eye, or gratify the smell. But then they
must also imitate them, in only selecting those flowers that yield
honey; and when they extract the sweet juices, let them be careful to
leave the poison behind. In like manner we should gather together
from the heathen literature whatever may be useful, and leave what
is pernicious to morals behind.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This was but saying what Plato
and Cicero had said before him, and it cannot be charged to the
account of a Christian prelate as narrow bigotry, that he should
insist on at least as much reserve in the use of profane writers as had
been required by the pagan moralists themselves.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that the Christian prelates were insensible
to the dangers incurred by students in the State academies. St.
Chrysostom, indeed, who knew what they were by experience, and
who was certainly the last man to undervalue a knowledge of letters,
was induced to weigh the arguments for and against a public school
education, and decides that the risk is too great to be compensated
for by any intellectual advantage. He declares that he knows of no
school in his neighbourhood where the study of profane literature
can be found united to the teaching of virtue; and this being the
case, he considers that Christian parents will generously sacrifice the
superior tuition given in the State gymnasia, and send their children
to be brought up in a monastery. His words are the more remarkable
from the extreme moderation of their tone, and the evident
reluctance with which he advocates a course of conduct which must
needs place the faithful at a disadvantage. They are also important
as showing how very early the monasteries began to be regarded as
places of education, for seculars as well as religious. “If you have
masters among you,” he writes,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> “who can answer for the virtue of
your children, I should be very far from advocating your sending
them to a monastery; on the contrary, I should strongly insist on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
their remaining where they are. But if no one can give such a
guarantee, we ought not to send children to schools where they will
learn vice before they learn science, and where in acquiring learning
of relatively small value, they will lose what is far more precious,
their integrity of soul. Are we then to give up literature? you
will exclaim. I do not say that; but I do say that we must not kill
souls.... When the foundations of a building are sapped, we
should seek rather for architects to reconstruct the whole edifice,
than for artists to adorn the walls. In fact, the choice lies between
two alternatives; a liberal education which you may get by sending
your children to the public schools, or the salvation of their souls,
which you secure by sending them to the monks. Which is to gain
the day, science or the soul? If you can unite both advantages, do
so by all means; but if not, choose the most precious.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It will be apparent from what has been said, that the State academies
of the Empire are not to be numbered among the nurseries
of the Christian schools. The only imperial foundation which had
a distinctly Christian character about it, appears to have been that
which grew up at Constantinople, under the patronage of the Greek
emperors. It was established in the Basilica of the Octagon, built
by Constantine the Great, where an immense library was collected,
which in Zeno’s time amounted to 120,000 volumes. Seven librarians
and twelve professors were maintained at the public expense,
and the college was presided over by a president, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Œcumenicus</i>,
because he was supposed to be a sort of university in himself.
The church attached to this academy was served by sixteen
monks, and prelates were often chosen from the ranks of the professors
to fill the first sees of the Empire. This noble foundation
perished in 730, by the hands of Leo the Isaurian, who, finding that
the academicians would not enter into his Iconoclastic views, and
fearing their learning and their influence, caused fire to be applied to
the building by night, so that the Basilica, the vast library, and the
professors themselves, were all pitilessly consumed together.</p>

<p>But the parentage of the Christian schools is to be traced to less
splendid sources than the Greek universities or the palace of the
Cæsars. What these were has been indicated at the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
chapter; the catechetical and the episcopal schools have been
already spoken of, and we have now to examine how the work of
education came to be embraced by the fathers of that monastic life
which, like the canonical life of the clergy, found its first development
among the followers of St. Mark. St. Chrysostom’s words,
above quoted, show that in his time the monks of the East were
already in the habit of receiving and training children. In the
West, the work of education did not fall into the hands of the
Church until the dissolution of the Roman Empire, when she saw
herself obliged to open the doors of her episcopal and monastic
schools to secular students. But one thing is evident, that from the
first, the Western cœnobites had a certain organised system among
them for the education of their own younger members and that the
germ of the monastic school is to be found even in the deserts of
Egypt. In the rule of St. Pachomius, special directions are given
for the instruction of all those who shall come to the monastery. If
ignorant of letters, they are to have the rule explained to them, and
shall be sent to one who can teach them, and standing before him,
shall diligently learn from him, with all thankfulness. After that
they shall write for him letters, syllables, words, and names, and they
shall be compelled to read, even if unwilling; there shall be no one
in the monastery who shall not learn letters, and know something of
the Scriptures, at least the New Testament and the Psalter.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Twice
a week there were to be disputations; that is, spiritual conferences
or catechisms. Here is evidently the origin of the interior or claustral
school for the instruction of the younger or more ignorant of the
monks; and the object of such very stringent regulations is better
understood when we study the rest of the rule, and observe the great
importance attached to the exercise of spiritual reading, which occupied
almost as large a place in the horarium of St. Pachomius as
prayer or manual labour.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. The rule of this great monastic legislator distinctly
proves that children were received, and that at a very early age,
to be educated among the monks. He felt great compassion, we are
told, for the young, and was accustomed to say, that in the soil of
their minds good seed might be sown more easily than in more
advanced years. He considered them particularly capable of being
trained to acquire the habit of the presence of God; by which they
might afterwards advance to great perfection. Accordingly, his rule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
is full of provisions for the proper care of these young disciples. The
monks are warned not to scandalise them, even by an incautious
word: they are to have the recreation and food proper to their age,
but the monks are not to sport or laugh with them; and if any boy
be too much given to play and idleness, he is to receive sharp correction.
They are to eat in the refectory with the brethren, and join
them at their work, but at other times a sort of separation is to be
observed between them and the community.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The terms on which
the Fathers lived with their little disciples exhibit that character of
paternal tenderness which was one of the distinctive features of the
early Christian schools, offering a striking contrast to the state of
things existing in the pagan academies. There is, indeed, frequent
mention of the rod, but strict discipline was never held incompatible
with affectionate familiarity. The Fathers of the Desert had received
their traditions on this head from the immediate followers of Him
who took the young children in His arms, and willingly suffered them
to approach Him; and so it seemed but natural that they who sought
to imitate their Master, should surround themselves with little ones,
and permit them a certain holy familiarity which constantly reappears
in the intercourse between monks and children. Every one will
remember the anecdote that is told of St. Pachomius, who, in his
extreme humility, did not disdain to be set right by a little boy. As
he sat at work with his brethren, making mats, one of the children
said to him, “My father, you are not working in the right way; the
abbot Theodore does it quite differently.” “Then sit down, my
child,” replied the saint, “and show me how I ought to do it;” and
having received his lesson, he untwisted his osiers, and began his
work all over again. Another time, the saint having returned to the
monastery after an absence of some weeks, one of the children ran
out to meet him, saying, “I am glad you have come back, my father;
since you have been away they have given us neither soup nor vegetables
for dinner.” “Well, my child,” was the kind reply, “I will
take care that you do not want them for the future;” and calling
the cook, he administered to him a sharp rebuke.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even solitaries were induced to undertake the care of
children not intended for the religious state. Thus St. Chrysostom
relates the example of a Christian lady living at Antioch, who was
very desirous to procure for her son the blessings of a holy education,
and induced a certain solitary to leave his retreat among the mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and undertake the care of the youth: and he adds, the boy
made great progress in the sciences, but yet more in piety, and by
his example won many of his playfellows to embrace a life of virtue.
When, therefore, the great father of the monastic life in the Western
world received his two disciples, Placidus and Maurus, with a view
to their education, and so gave his followers an example which
resulted in the foundation of the great Benedictine schools, he was
not departing from the earlier monastic tradition, as Mabillon is careful
to show.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Nor must the decrees of certain councils which prohibit
monks from receiving any children, save those “offered” by
their parents to the religious state, be understood as implying more
than that such children could not be received into the <em>interior</em> or
claustral school; for, as the same writer proves, seculars were always
freely admitted into the <em>exterior</em> schools of monasteries.</p>

<p>St. Pachomius was not the only monastic legislator of ancient
times who in his rule provided for the admission and education of
children. St. Basil permitted them to be received into his monasteries
at a very early age, especially if they had lost their parents,
because monks should be the fathers of orphans. Their education,
he says, should be strictly religious; they are to have a separate
portion of the monastery assigned them, and are to be governed by
one of the elder monks who shall be both mild and learned, and
experienced in the care of children. He is very precise on the point
which proves the <em>crux</em> in most systems of education, namely, the
method to be observed in inflicting punishment; and though he does
not prohibit the use of the rod, he recommends in preference the
adoption of such penances as may correct the fault, as well as punish
the offender. “Let every fault have its own remedy,” he says, “so
that while the offence is punished the soul may be exercised to conquer
its passions. For example, has a child been angry with his
companion? Oblige him to beg pardon of the other and to do him
some humble service, for it is only by accustoming them to humility
that you will eradicate anger, which is always the offspring of pride.
Has he eaten out of meals? Let him remain fasting for a good
part of the day. Has he eaten to excess, and in an unbecoming
manner? At the hour of repast, let him, without eating himself,
watch others taking their food in a modest manner, and so he will
be learning how to behave at the same time that he is being
punished by his abstinence. And if he has offended by idle words,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
by rudeness, or by telling lies, let him be corrected by diet and
silence.”</p>

<p>After this he passes on to the studies of the children, and desires
that instead of learning the fables of the poets they should be taught
the wonderful events narrated in Scripture History. They are to
learn by heart sentences chosen from the Book of Proverbs, and
little prizes are to be given them in reward for their exercises of
memory, “to the end that they may learn with the less reluctance, nay
rather with pleasure, and as though engaging in agreeable recreation.”
The masters are particularly enjoined to train them to recall their
wandering thoughts and fix their attention on their work, by frequently
interrogating them as to what they are thinking about. And
whilst acquiring a knowledge of letters, they are likewise to be taught
some useful art or trade.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In most of the rules drawn up by the early Gallican prelates we
see that stringent regulations were introduced for obliging all the
brethren to acquire a certain knowledge of letters. “Literas omnes
discant,” is the thirty-second brief and emphatic rule of St. Aurelian,
Bishop of Arles in the sixth century. What is more remarkable, we
find exactly the same provisions in rules drawn up for religious
women, as in those of St. Donatus and St. Cæsarius of Arles.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The
sixth chapter of the rule of St. Leander of Seville, is headed thus:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut jugiter virgo oret et legat.</i> “Let your time and occupation be so
divided,” he says, “that after reading you pray, and after prayer you
read; and let these two good works perpetually alternate, so that no
part of your time be wholly without them. And when you do any
manual work or refresh your body with needful food, then let another
read, that when the hands and the eyes are intent on work the ear
may be fed with the Divine Word. For if even when we read and
pray we are hardly able to withdraw our minds from the temptations
of the devil, how much more prone will not the soul be to vice, if it
be not held back by the chain of prayer and assiduous reading.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
And in the chapter that follows he gives directions for the proper
manner of studying the books of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Before bringing these remarks to a close we cannot omit all notice
of the education received in primitive times by the children of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
faithful, in the bosoms of their own families. Fleury points out to
his readers as one proof of the care taken by Christian parents in the
instruction of their children, that in all antiquity we do not find the
least notice of any public catechism for children, or any public
instruction for those who had been baptized before they came to the
use of reason. It was not needed, he says, for in those days, to use
the words of St. Chrysostom, “every house was a Church.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The office of religious instruction generally devolved on the
mother. Even in Scripture there is evidence of this, for St. Paul,
writing to St. Timothy, reminds him of what he owed to the “faith
unfeigned” of his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> St.
Basil, and his brother St. Gregory of Nyssa, gloried in preserving the
faith in which they had been trained by their grandmother St.
Macrina the elder. Their other brother, St. Peter of Sebaste, was
chiefly brought up by his sister of the same name. St. Gregory thus
describes the extraordinary care bestowed by his mother on the
education of her daughter. “My mother,” he says, “took extreme
pains with her instruction, not after the manner customary with those
of her age, who are ordinarily <ins class="corr" id="tn25" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Added ellipsis after “taught the fables of the poets”.">taught the fables of the poets</ins>....
Instead of these she made her learn such portions of Scripture as
were easiest to understand. She began with the book of Wisdom,
and thence went on to the Psalms.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> St. Fulgentius owed his
education, not merely in sacred science, but also in polite literature,
to the care of his mother Mariana, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">religiosa mater</i> as she is
called in his life, who was so solicitous about the purity of his Greek
accent that she made him learn by heart the poems of Homer and
Menander before he studied his Latin rudiments.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The early education,
both liberal and religious, of St. John Chrysostom was in like
manner directed by his admirable mother Anthusa, whose conduct in
this particular drew from the lips of the pagan sophist, Libanius, the
exclamation, “Ye gods of Greece! how wonderful are the women of
the Christians!” In fact it is remarkable how many Christian women
of early times are spoken of as being learned. Not to mention St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Catherine of Alexandria, whose case was possibly exceptional, we
know that St. Thecla, the disciple of St. Paul, was versed in philosophy,
poetry, and rhetoric; St. Olympia, the holy widow of Constantinople,
not only corresponded with St. Chrysostom, seventeen
of whose letters are addressed to her, but received the dedication
of several of St. Gregory of Nazianzen’s poems. St. Jerome, again,
dedicated his commentaries on Isaias and Ezechiel to his pupil St.
Eustochium, who, he assures us, wrote, spoke, and recited Hebrew
without the least trace of a Latin accent. And, not to multiply
examples, we may just refer to that passage in his epistles where he
speaks of St. Marcella, “the glory of the Roman ladies,” as showing
that the learned accomplishments of these illustrious women were
not acquired at any sacrifice of qualities more peculiarly becoming
their sex. “What virtues did I not find in her?” he says, writing to
her spiritual daughter, Principia; “what penetration, what purity,
what holiness! She became so learned that after my departure from
Rome, when difficulties were found in any obscure passage of Scripture,
people applied to her as to a judge; yet she possessed in a
sovereign degree that delicate discernment which always perceives
what is becoming; and used always to communicate her ideas as if
they had been suggested by somebody else, so that while instructing
others, she appeared herself to be a pupil.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Never, surely, was there a greater error than that into which one
of our most learned critics has fallen, when he asserts that “the idea
and place of woman has been <em>slowly and laboriously</em> elevated by the
Gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He could not have written thus had he been as familiar
with the records of the Christian Church as with those of pagan antiquity.
The most perfect exemplars of Christian womanhood appear
in the history of the primitive ages. The grand ideal of the Roman
virgin or matron, softened, purified, and elevated by the Gospel precepts
and the Apostolic teaching, retaining all its former strength,
but acquiring a new element of tenderness, produced those exquisite
flowers of sanctity whom the Church appears in some sort to regard
as her children of predilection. They were not the growth of one
Church or province, but simultaneously, wherever the Christian faith
was preached, they expanded their beautiful petals to the Sun of
Justice; and we have in Rome an Agnes and a Cecilia; in Sicily a
Lucy and an Agatha; in Carthage a Felicitas; in Alexandria a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Catherine; a Blandina in Gaul, and in barbarous Britain, an
Ursula.</p>

<p>Whence arose this instantaneous regeneration of the womanly
character? The Catholic hardly needs to ask himself the question,
for the form on which it was modelled is so obvious that it requires
not to be indicated. It grew out of no dead code of precepts, but
out of the living memory of her, the Mother <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par excellence</i>, the Virgin-Mother
of God, and the model of all Christian virgins and mothers;
she whose countenance St. Isidore describes as “gravely sweet and
sweetly grave;” whose tranquil gait and gentle voice St. Ambrose
has dwelt on, as well as her modesty and reverence, “rising up in the
presence of her elders.” And it was she of whom he also says,
gathering up the precious fragments of ancient tradition, that she
was “diligent in reading,” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legendi studiosior</i>, a trait which reappears in
the character of the holy women of early times, and which we are
thus able to link on to the source whence they derived their ideal of
womanly perfection.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that the influence of such women, and
specially of such mothers, was a powerful means of preserving the
Roman youth from the infection which hung over the public
academies, even after the establishment of a nominal Christianity in
the institutions of the State. But of these academies I need speak
no further. They formed a part of the old Roman civilisation, and
perished in its wreck, swallowed up in those waves of barbarism
which, as they poured over Europe, ground to pieces every monument
of the Empire, and swept their fragments into oblivion. In
the midst of the deluge, however, the Ark of God floated over the
waters, and accepted the mission of reconstructing a ruined world.
The Church alone preserved so much as the memory of letters,
though in the inconceivable troubles of the crisis her utmost efforts
for a time only sufficed to keep up schools in which the clergy
received the instruction necessary for their state; and secular learning
for the most part fell into decay. But the want was felt and
lamented by the clergy themselves, a proof that learning, at any rate,
never lost its value in their eyes. Thus, in his letter to the Council
of Constantinople in 680, Pope Agatho excuses the simplicity of his
legates; “for how,” he says, “can we look for great erudition among
men living in the midst of barbarous nations, forced with difficulty
to earn their daily bread by the labour of their hands? Nevertheless,”
he adds, “they will expound to you the faith of the Apostolic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Church, not with human eloquence, for they have none; but with
the simplicity of the faith which we have held from our cradles.”
The synodal letter of the Western bishops to the same council is
couched in similar terms. “As to secular eloquence,” they say, “we
think no one in our time will boast of possessing it. Our countries
are continually agitated by the fury of different nations; there is
nothing around us but war, invasion, and plunder. In the midst of
the barbarians our life is full of disturbance, the patrimony of our
churches has been seized, and we have to live by the labour of our
hands. The faith is all that is left us, and our solitary glory is to
preserve it during life, and to be ready to die in its defence.”</p>

<p>These two documents, often quoted, have perhaps given rise to
somewhat exaggerated notions regarding the extent of the ignorance
complained of. It is certain that there were periods of comparative
tranquillity during which liberal studies were at least partially preserved.
The schools of Gaul did not begin to decay till the end of
the fifth century, and even then some were found who exerted themselves
to keep alive the ancient learning; such as St. Sidonius
Apollinaris, who received his education in the public schools of
Lyons before his elevation to the Episcopate in 471, and Claudian
Mamertus, a monk by profession and education, who was declared
by his friend Sidonius to be equally incomparable in every science to
which he applied. Besides being an amazing reader, he was an
original thinker. His great work on “The Nature of the Soul” is
said to display the precision and method of the latter scholastics,
and contains proofs of the existence and immateriality of the soul
drawn from its capacity of thought, which appear like anticipations
of the famous Cartesian formula <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cogito, ergo sum</i>. In his arguments
he appeals not only to the authority of Scripture and the Fathers,
but also to that of Plato and other Greek philosophers, and shows
himself not unacquainted with the systems of Zoroaster and the
Brahmins. To him we owe the arrangement of a great part of the
Breviary office, and the beautiful hymn for Passion Sunday, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pange
lingua gloriosi prœlium certamina</i>. For poetry, no less than philosophy,
found votaries in the Gallican schools. The lyre, which had
fallen from the hands of Prudentius, was still touched by St. Prosper
of Aquitaine and St. Avitus of Vienne, the former of whom may be
called the poet of Divine grace, whilst the latter, eleven centuries
before the time of Milton, chose for the theme of his verses the Fall
of Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Down to the beginning of the seventh century the schools of Gaul
still taught Virgil and the Roman law, and in them the sons of the
barbarous Visigoths received some tincture of polite letters. The
Gallo-Roman nobility showed the utmost solicitude to obtain such
education for their children as the times afforded; and we find
notices of schools wherein grammar, rhetoric, and law were taught
in separate courses after the Roman fashion. The Gallican orators,
as in the time of St. Jerome, betrayed their Celtic origin by a certain
verbose eloquence, which had to be pruned according to the severer
rules of Roman rhetoric. The mother of Rufinus had sent him to
the imperial capital, that the Roman gravity might temper the too
great fecundity of the Gallic speech, and St. Desiderius of Cahors
was made to go through a course of Roman jurisprudence with the
same intention.</p>

<p>Nor, whilst noticing these evidences of a love of letters, surviving
even in the period of decay, must I neglect to mention that notable
academy of Toulouse, which at one time did its best to involve all
Europe in a fog of learned perplexity. Its eccentricities would
scarcely merit to be recorded, had they not left very distinct traces
both in the Irish and Anglo-Saxon literature. The history of this
academy has been written by one of its members, the false Virgil,
as he is called, who has contrived to mystify both the date and
whereabouts of its foundation. It is presumed, however, to have
flourished at Toulouse sometime in the sixth century. Holding to
the principle that pearls must not be cast before swine, certain
enthusiasts of Aquitaine formed among themselves a secret scholastic
society, the members of which spoke a language understood only by
the initiated, and conferred on men and places the nomenclature of
ancient Greece and Rome. The grand, I might almost say the
exclusive, study of these illuminati was grammar. An assembly of
thirty of their number had gravely determined that the subject most
worthy of a wise man’s meditation was the conjugation of the Latin
verb, and on this momentous theme they split into two sects, which
rivalled Guelph and Ghibelline in the ardour of their mutual animosities.
The heads of these two parties, whose academic names
were Terence and Galbungus, spent fourteen days and nights discussing
the question whether the pronoun <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego</i> had a vocative case:
at last the difficulty was referred to Eneas, who decided that it might
be allowed to possess one when employed in the interrogative phrase.
These grammatical debates took place when Virgil was but a youth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
but in his riper years he thoroughly maintained the reputation of his
masters. It was the exact government of words which left him no
repose, and he tells us how one night, having retired to rest, he was
awaked by a knocking at his door, and found that the disturbance
was caused by the arrival of a certain Spanish grammarian, named
Mitterius, whom he honoured neither more nor less than if he had
been a prophet of God. Mitterius begged for a night’s lodging,
promising in return to answer any question which his entertainer
might put to him. The opportunity was not to be lost; there was
but one thing just then that Virgil desired to know, and, springing
from his bed, he at once required, as the price of his hospitality, a
direct rule by which he could determine when the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hic</i> was an
adverb and when it was a pronoun. These anecdotes, however, give
us but a faint notion of the labours of the Toulouse grammarians.
The difficulties of the Latin syntax were not sufficient to satisfy their
thirst for obscurity, and they therefore expended their ingenuity on
inventing new means of perplexing their own brains and those of
their scholars. “Was it to be supposed,” they asked, “that this
noble tongue was so poor and barren, that its words could be used
in one sense only? On the contrary, the true grammarian knew
very well that, besides the vulgar Latin known to the common herd,
there existed eleven other kinds, each of which had a distinct
grammar of its own.” According to this system of “the twelve
Latinities,” everything had twelve names, any one of which might be
used according to pleasure. New vocabularies had to be invented,
either by the Latinising of Greek roots, or transposing the letters of
the original words in such a way as to form a variety of new combinations.
New conjugations and declensions adorned the grammar
of the initiated, and to complete their system a new prosody was
added, in which the dactyls and spondees appear to have been
measured, not by quantity, but by accent.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Even the triumphs of the barbarians did not in all cases result in
the immediate extinction of letters. In Italy a second Augustan
age bid fair at one time to arise under the rule of Theodoric, the
Ostrogoth. His court was adorned by the genius of two great men&mdash;Boethius,
the Christian philosopher, and the last of the classic
writers; and Cassiodorus, in whom closed the long line of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
consuls. Both of them exerted a powerful influence over the studies
of succeeding generations. The original Latin works of Boethius
supplied the schools with a series of Christian classics which were
naturally held in extraordinary esteem by teachers who, as time went
on, felt with increasing force the difficulty of training Christian
youth exclusively out of pagan class-books. And it was chiefly by
his translations from the Greek that the mediæval scholars acquired
their knowledge of the Greek philosophy, at a time when the study
of that tongue had ceased to be generally pursued. A yet further
addition to scholastic literature was contributed by Cassiodorus.
He was not indeed the only statesman who had distinguished himself
in this line. Towards the close of the fifth century Marcian
Capella, an African pro-consul, had produced his celebrated work on
the Espousals of Mercury and Philology, which he chooses to personify
as a goddess; the seven liberal sciences, into which all known
learning had been classified since the days of Philo, being represented
as the handmaidens presented by the bridegroom to the bride.
His <cite>Satiricon</cite>, written in nine books, continued to be one of the
most popular text-books in use during the middle ages, and was at an
early period translated into the vernacular.</p>

<p>But Cassiodorus was not merely a writer of schoolbooks; he was
the founder of a monastic school, which, for the variety of sciences
which it cultivated, has not unfrequently been given the title of a
university. And indeed it was not undeserving of the name. Its
noble founder, when still in the service of Theodoric, had attempted,
in conjunction with Pope St. Agapetus, to found a catechetical
school at Rome, on the model of those which formerly flourished at
Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Nisibis, in which he proposed to maintain
a staff of professors at his own expense. This magnificent
design having failed, in consequence of the troubles of the time,
Cassiodorus retired from a world in which he had nobly toiled for
seventy years, and devoted his old age to the creation of a seminary
of Christian learning on his own estate of Vivaria, at the very
extremity of the Calabrian peninsula. He collected a rich library,
which he increased by the labours of his monks, on whom he enjoined
the transcription of books as their principal manual labour. It was
to ensure their accuracy in this employment that, at the age of
eighty-three, he undertook the composition of his treatise <cite>De Orthographia</cite>.
He drew up a plan of studies for his scholars, and wrote
for their use two treatises, one “On the Teaching of Sacred Letters,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and the other “On the Seven Liberal Arts.” This latter was a kind
of encyclopædia, including separate treatises on each subject, which
formed some of the favourite elementary class-books in use during
the middle ages. Hallam remarks of this encyclopædia and of
others undertaken on a similar plan, that they themselves furnish
significant indications of a decadence of letters. Such collections
must necessarily include only the most meagre sketches of the
sciences of which they profess to treat, and their multiplication at
this period indicates that men were beginning to be content with a
very superficial description of knowledge. So also the numerous
translations from the Greek undertaken by Boethius and Cassiodorus
are sufficient evidence that the knowledge of that language was
becoming rare. Nor will the praises bestowed by Cassiodorus on
his friend’s versions, which he declares superior to the originals,
probably raise his character as a critic in the judgment of scholars.
But the fact that his labours were undertaken at a period of literary
decay, when the inconceivable disorders of the time seemed to present
an insuperable obstacle to the pursuit of learning, increases our
admiration of the energy and zeal displayed by the old Roman,
which enabled him in spite of every discouragement to create a
school of sacred and profane learning, where strangers were encouraged
to seek that hospitality the exercise of which was regarded as
one of the most sacred duties of the brethren. There, under porticoes
and gardens adorned with every beauty that could charm the
eye or soothe the heart, pilgrims, weary with those scenes of violence
and devastation that were turning many a fair district of Gaul and
Italy into a howling wilderness, found all that remained of Roman
learning and civilisation linked with the higher attractions of Christian
devotion; and were able, amid the monastic shades of Vivaria,
to enjoy at one and the same time the calm of retirement and the
solace of prayer.</p>

<p>The foundation of Cassiodorus took place in the year 540.
Eighteen years previously&mdash;in 522&mdash;the two Roman senators,
Equitius and Tertullus, had taken their sons Maurus and Placidus
to the grotto of Subiaco, and committed them to the care of a
solitary named Benedict. Maurus was twelve years old and Placidus
seven, and they were soon joined by other children of the same age.
They were humble beginnings indeed of a mighty edifice, the first
fruits of the Benedictine schools.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In 543 St. Maurus carried the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
rule of St. Benedict into Gaul, where monasteries soon multiplied,
in which were cultivated letters both sacred and profane.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But they
were not the earliest monastic schools which had sprung up on the
Gallican soil. I need not here remind the reader of that famous
abbey of Marmoutier, erected by St. Martin of Tours in the fourth
century, and formed on the model of those episcopal monasteries
founded by St. Eusebius of Vercelli and St. Ambrose of Milan.
Yet more celebrated, and more closely associated with the history
of letters in our own country, was the school of Lerins, a rocky isle off
the coast of Gaul, where, about the year 400, St. Honoratus fixed his
abode, peopling it with a race of monks who united the labours of
the scholar to the penitential practices of the recluse. Its rule, though
strictly monastic, aimed at making its disciples apostolic men,
“thoroughly furnished to all good works.” Hence the brethren were
not required to renounce the pursuit of letters. St. Honoratus himself
did not disdain the flowers of eloquence, and the sweetness of his
style drew from St. Eucher the graceful remark, that “he restored the
honey to the wax.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> St. Hilary of Arles, another of the Lerins scholars,
is represented by his biographer sitting among his clergy with a table
before him, whereon lay his book and the materials of his manual
work, and while his fingers were busy making nets, dictating to a
cleric, who took down his notes in shorthand. It would take us too
long to enumerate the distinguished prelates who were sent forth
from the school of Lerins during the sixth century. The names of
St. Cesarius of Arles and St. Vincent of Lerins; of Salvian, the
master of bishops as he was called; of St. Eucher, the purity of
whose Latin eloquence even Erasmus has praised; and of St. Lupus
of Troyes, whom Sidonius Apollinaris hesitated not to call the first
bishop in the Christian world&mdash;may suffice to show what sort of
scholars were produced by this holy congregation.</p>

<p>Such then was the state of letters at the opening of the sixth
century, an epoch when Europe was covered with the shattered
remains of an expiring civilisation, and when whatever literary
activity lingered about the old academies of Italy and Gaul must
be regarded as the parting rays of a light, fast sinking below the
horizon. Yet, as it sank, another luminary was sending forth its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
rising beams, and the essentially Christian institution of the monastic
schools was acquiring shape and solidity. Such an epoch stood
in need of a master to harmonise its disordered elements, and such
a master it found in St. Gregory. But before speaking of him and
of his Anglo-Saxon converts we must glance at the state of letters
among that earlier Celtic population which sent students from
Britain to the schools of Rome in the days of St. Jerome and St.
Damasus. Nor whilst doing so, can we forget that sister-isle which
never felt the tread of the Roman legions, and which, sharing with
Britain the glorious title of the “Isle of Saints,” merited by its extraordinary
devotion to learning to be designated also the “Isle of
Scholars.”</p>

<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 380 TO 590.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the monastic institute existed in Britain almost from the
period of her first conversion to the faith, yet the seminaries which
produced her most illustrious scholars were only founded at a comparatively
later date. Whatever schools may have existed in connection
with the British episcopal monasteries of earlier times, had
fallen into decay by the beginning of the fifth century, when fresh
foundations of learning began to spring up, the origin of which must
be traced to three distinct sources. I say <em>three</em> distinct sources,
because the apostolic labours of St. Ninian among the Picts, of St.
Palladius in North Britain, and of St. Germanus and St. Lupus in
the southern portion of the island, were undertaken among different
races, and on different occasions; nevertheless, in reality these three
streams flowed forth from one common fountain, which was no other
than the Holy and Apostolic See of Rome.</p>

<p>The mission of St. Ninian was the first in order of time. The
son of a petty prince of Cumberland, he travelled to Rome for the
purpose of study, about the year 380, and being introduced to the
notice of Pope Damasus, was placed by him under the care of
teachers, and in all probability received into the school of the
Patriarchium. There he was thoroughly instructed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regulariter
edoctus</i>, in all the mysteries of the faith, and after spending fifteen
years in Rome he at last received consecration from the hands of
Pope St. Siricius, by whom he was sent back to exercise the episcopal
functions in his own country. The fifth century, which was
then just opening, was precisely that in which the discipline of the
Church received its fullest development. Ninian, who had so long
studied the ecclesiastical system at its fountain-head, and who on
his homeward journey had visited Tours, and conversed with St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Martin, then drawing near his end, was fully prepared to introduce
into his northern diocese the rule and manner of life which he had
seen carried out in the churches of Italy and Gaul. At Whitherne
in Galloway, where he fixed his see, he built a stone church, after
the Roman fashion, and lived in a house adjoining it, together
with his cathedral clergy, in strict observance of the ecclesiastical
canons. In this episcopal college the younger clerics followed their
ecclesiastical studies, whilst a school was likewise opened for the
children of the neighbourhood, as appears from the anecdote related
by St. Ælred of one little rebel who ran away to escape a flogging,
and was nearly drowned when attempting to put to sea in a coracle,
or wicker boat, which chanced to be without its usual covering of
hides.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The great school, as St. Ninian’s seminary is often styled,
was resorted to both by British and Irish scholars, and among the
works left written by the founder was a Book of Sentences, or selections
from the Fathers, which seems to have been intended for the
use of his students.</p>

<p>The death of Ninian took place at the time when the churches of
South Britain were suffering from the ravages of the Pelagian heresy.
Pelagius, himself a Briton by birth, had nowhere found more ready
recipients of his doctrines than among his own countrymen, and the
infection spread with such alarming rapidity that at the solicitation
of Palladius, deacon of the Church of Rome, Pope St. Celestine
commissioned the two Gallican bishops, St. Germanus of Auxerre
and St. Lupus of Troyes, to visit Britain in the quality of Papal
legates, and take the necessary steps for putting a stop to the troubles
caused by the heretics. Their first visit took place in 429, on which
occasion they introduced many reforms of discipline. One of the
chief measures which they adopted in order to check the progress of
error was the foundation of schools of learning both for clergy and
laity. At Caerleon, then the British capital, they themselves began
the good work by lecturing on the Holy Scriptures and the liberal
arts. Their scholars appear to have done them credit, for some, we
read, became profound astronomers, able to observe the course of the
stars and to foretell prodigies (that is, to calculate eclipses), whilst
others wholly devoted themselves to the study of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Under these disciples a vast number of monastic schools soon sprang
up in various parts of Britain. Indeed so undoubted is the claim of
Germanus to be considered as the founder of the ancient British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
colleges, that some imaginative writers have assigned to him the
origin of our two Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. His most
celebrated followers were Dubricius and Iltutus, the first of whom
established two great schools of sacred letters on the banks of the
Wye, one of which, situated at Hentland, was attended by a thousand
students. But this was surpassed by the monastery of Lantwit
in Glamorganshire, where St. Iltutus presided over a community of
two thousand four hundred members, including many scholars of
note, such as the historian Gildas, the bard Taliesin, and the famous
prelates, St. Sampson and St. Paul of Leon. Here, according to
the Triads, the praises of God never ceased, but one hundred monks
were employed each hour in chanting the divine office, which was
kept up both by day and night. Iltutus was also the founder, or
restorer, of the school of Bangor on the Dee, where had been a
college of Christian philosophers in the days of King Lucius, and
where, according to Bede, there were seven houses or colleges, each
containing, at least, three hundred students; and this, says William
of Malmesbury, “we may well believe by what we see; for so many
half-ruined walls of churches, so many windings of porticoes, and so
great a heap of ruins you may scarce see elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Another Bangor, the same that still retains the name which was
indeed common to all these foundations, owed its origin to Daniel,
the fellow disciple of St. Iltutus, who, we are assured, received under
his care all the most hopeful youths of West Britain. Paulinus,
one of his scholars, founded the college of the White House, in
Caermarthenshire, afterwards known as Whitland Abbey, or Alba
Landa; receiving among other pupils St. David, who began his
studies at Bangor under Iltutus. This celebrated man, whose name
in our days is often regarded as almost as legendary as that of his
contemporary, King Arthur, completed the extirpation of the
Pelagian heresy, and by his apostolic labours merited the title
bestowed on him by British historians of “the father of his country.”
He was the founder of no fewer than twelve monasteries, in all of
which he contrived to combine the hard work of the scholar and
the equally hard labour of the monk. Ploughing and grammar-learning
succeeded each other by turns. “Knowing,” says Capgrave,
“that secure rest is the nourisher of all vices, he subjected the
shoulders of his monks to hard wearisomeness.... They detested
riches, and they had no cattle to till their ground, but each one was
instead of an ox to himself and his brethren. When they had done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
their field-work, returning to the cloisters of their monastery, they
spent the rest of the day till evening in reading and writing. And
in the evening at the sound of the bell, presently laying aside their
work, and leaving even a letter unfinished, they went to the church
and remained there till the stars appeared, and then all went together
to table to eat, but not to fulness. Their food was bread
with roots or herbs, seasoned with salt, and they quenched their
thirst with milk mingled with water. Supper being ended they
persevered about three hours in watching, prayer, and genuflections.
After this they went to rest, and at cock-crowing rose again, and
abode in prayer till the dawn of day. Their only clothing was the
skins of beasts.” Yet these austere cœnobites cultivated all the
liberal arts, and the monastery of the Rosy Valley, near Menevia,
founded in the year 519, was no less a school of polite learning than
it was a nursery of saints.</p>

<p>To St. Dubricius, St. Daniel, and St. David, the three dioceses of
Llandaff, Bangor, and Menevia owe their origin; the fourth of the
ancient sees, that of St. Asaph, sprang out of a monastic foundation
which must be traced to a different source. It has been already said
that the mission of St. Germanus and St. Lupus had been conferred
on them by St. Celestine at the solicitation of the deacon Palladius,
who by some writers is said to have been himself a Briton by birth.
However that may be, his interest in the affairs of our northern islands
induced St. Celestine, in the year 430, to send him to Ireland, after
having first consecrated him bishop “over the Scots believing in
Christ.” The Christian faith had, in fact, already penetrated into
Ireland, either from Gaul or Britain, but the faithful were as yet few
in number, and possessed no regular hierarchy. Palladius at first
met with such success, that St. Prosper, in his book against Cassian,
written about this time, was able to say that St. Celestine, after preserving
the <em>Roman</em> island Catholic, had made the <em>barbarous</em> island
Christian. He baptized many persons, and erected three churches
in which he deposited the sacred books, some relics of SS. Peter
and Paul, and his own writing-tablets. But soon afterwards the
hostility of the native princes obliged him to withdraw from the
country, in order not to expose his followers to persecution. As
his mission was to the Scottish people, and not to any particular
province or kingdom, he crossed over to North Britain, where several
colonies of the Scots had already settled, and there pursued his
apostolic labours with more prosperous results. His subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
history is differently related by different authors. Some represent
him as surviving for many years, and firmly establishing the ecclesiastical
discipline of the North British Church. Others, with more
appearance of probability, represent his death as taking place very
shortly after his arrival in Scotland. It is certain, however, that
regular discipline was established by him among his clergy, and that
episcopal colleges were founded either by him or his immediate
successors, in which young children were received and trained for
the ecclesiastical state. Here the Scottish Christians of Hibernia
would naturally repair, before the establishment of similar seminaries
had begun in their own island, and among those who acquired the
first seeds of learning in the Bishop’s school was Cœlius Sedulius,
whose Irish name is said to have been Sheil. His history is obscure,
but, according to Trithemius, he passed over from Ireland into
Britain about the year 430, and afterwards perfected his studies in
the best schools of Gaul and Italy. Having embraced the ecclesiastical
state, he thenceforward devoted himself exclusively to sacred
letters; but his “Carmen Paschale,” a Latin poem on the life of our
Lord, betrays his familiarity with the poetry of Virgil. From another
smaller poem on the same subject are taken two of the hymns used
by the Church on the festivals of Christmas and the Epiphany.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
St. Servanus, the first bishop of Orkney, is represented by some as
a disciple of St. Palladius, but it is probable that he lived some years
later. He was the founder of the monastery of Culross, where he
brought up many youths from childhood, and educated them for
the sacred ministry. Among these was one named Kentigern, so
beautiful in person, and so innocent in manners, that his companions
bestowed on him the title of <em>Mungo</em>, or the dearly beloved, by which
name he is still best known in Scotland. When only twenty-five
years of age the people demanded him for their bishop; he was
accordingly consecrated by an Irish prelate, and chose for his residence
a certain solitary place at the mouth of the river Clyde, the
site of the present city of Glasgow. Here he erected a church and
monastery, where he lived with his clergy according to the apostolic
rule, his diocese extending from the Atlantic to the shores of the
German Ocean; and over its vast extent he constantly journeyed on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
foot, preaching and administering baptism. The throne of the
Scottish prince Rydderch the Liberal having been seized by one of
his rebellious nobles, St. Kentigern was forced by the usurper to
quit the country, and took refuge in Wales, where, after visiting St.
David at Menevia, he received from one of the Welsh princes a
grant of the tract of land lying between the rivers Elwy and Clywd,
where he erected the monastery and school of Llan-Elwy. Local
tradition affirms that the name of Clywd was bestowed by him on
the stream that bounded his domain, in memory of his old home on
the banks of the Clyde. Here he was joined by a great number of
followers, among whom he established regular monastic discipline.
His rule, however, had some peculiarities in it. He divided his
community into three companies, two of them, who were unlearned,
were employed in agriculture and the domestic offices, the third,
which was formed of the learned, devoted their time to study and
apostolic labours; and this last class numbered upwards of three
hundred. These again were divided into two choirs, one of whom
entered the church as the others left, so that the praises of God at
all hours resounded in their mouths. From this college a great
number of apostolic missionaries went forth, not only into different
parts of Britain, but also to Norway, Iceland, and the Orkney Islands
St. Kentigern himself continued to journey about, preaching the
faith, silencing the Pelagian heretics, and founding churches. On
the restoration of Rydderch, in 544, St. Kentigern was recalled to
his see, and left the government of his monastery and school at
Llan-Elwy to St. Asaph, his favourite scholar, whose name was
afterwards conferred upon the church and diocese.</p>

<p>One other British school must be named before passing on to the
nurseries of sacred science established in the sister isle, it is that
of Llancarvan, whose founder was indeed a British saint and prince,
but one who had received his early education in the seminary of
an Irish recluse. Few names in the ecclesiastical annals of Britain
are more illustrious than that of St. Cadoc; the son of a prince of
Brecknockshire, he was placed at the age of seven years under the
care of Tathai, an Irish teacher, who had been induced to leave his
mountain hermitage, and to take the government of the monastic
college of Gwent in Monmouthshire. There Cadoc spent twelve
years, studying the liberal arts and the Divine Scriptures. The times
were simple, and the habits of the Irish doctor, as he is called, were
somewhat austere. The young prince lighted his master’s fire and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
cooked his frugal repast, whilst in the interval of such homely duties
he conned his Latin grammar, and construed Virgil. This sort of
school discipline, however, far from disgusting him with learning,
inspired him with such a passion for letters, that when his father
retired from the world to embrace an eremitical life, Cadoc would
not accept of the dignity of chief thus left vacant, but chose to travel
to various schools in Britain and Ireland, in order to perfect his
studies. At last he fixed on a rural solitude in Glamorganshire,
about three miles from the present town of Cowbridge, and there
laid the foundation of a church and monastery, which became one
of the most famous of all the British schools. It obtained the name
of Llancarvan, or the Church of the Stags, because, according to the
ancient legend, whilst it was in course of building, some stags from
the neighbouring forest, forgetting their natural wildness, came and
offered themselves to the service of the saint, suffering him to yoke
them to the cart which two weary or discontented monks had refused
to draw.</p>

<p>Gildas the Wise, the pupil of St. Iltutus, was invited by Cadoc to
deliver lectures in his college, which he did for the space of one year,
desiring no other stipend than the prayers of his scholars; and during
this time, says John of Tinmouth, he with his own hand copied
out a book of the Gospels long preserved in the monastery of Llancarvan.
At last the troubles caused by the advancing arms of “the
dragons of Germany,” as the Saxons were sometimes termed, obliged
Cadoc and Gildas to quit Llancarvan, and take refuge in some small
islands lying at the mouth of the Severn called the Holmes. Tradition
still points to the Steep Holmes as the place of their retreat; and
the wild peony and onion, which blossom there in profusion, but are
not to be found on any part of the neighbouring coast, are commonly
said to have sprung from those which grew in the garden of Gildas.
He did not, however, long remain there, but in company with Cadoc
joined some bands of British emigrant who had crossed over to
Armorica. The two saints chose for their residence a cave in the
little island of Ronech, where their fame attracted a crowd of disciples,
who were accustomed twice a day to pass over from the mainland
in little boats in order to enjoy their instruction. Cadoc was
touched by their perseverance, and at last employed his mechanical
genius in the contrivance of a bridge for their use, and did not refuse
to deal out to them the bread of science. He made them learn
Virgil by heart as well as the Scriptures; indeed his love for the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Mantuan was so enthusiastic that he generally carried the Æneid
under his arm, and was accustomed to express his regrets to Gildas
that one who on earth had sung so sweetly should be for ever shut
out from the joys of heaven. St. Cadoc is said by some to have
returned to Britain and found a martyr’s crown at the hands of the
pagan Saxons. According to the Glastonbury historians, St. Gildas
also returned to his own country, and lies buried among the unnumbered
saints of the isle of Avalon.</p>

<p>We have now to turn to the shores of that island which, if termed
barbarous by St. Prosper from the circumstance of its never having
formed any portion of the Roman Empire, was soon to become the
means of enlightening many a land of more ancient civilisation. The
history of the mission of St. Patrick has found too many narrators
to need repetition in this place, and we shall only advert therefore
to such points as have a particular interest in connection with
the Irish schools. Whatever disputes have arisen as to the birthplace
of St. Patrick, there has never been any difference of opinion as to
the sources whence he derived his education. It seems certain that
after his return from his second captivity in Ireland he studied for
four years at Tours under St. Martin, whose nephew he is commonly
said to have been; after which, in the thirtieth year of his age&mdash;that
is to say, about the year 418&mdash;he placed himself under the direction
of St. Germanus of Auxerre, with whom he continued his studies.
Hence in the hymn attributed to Fiech it is said of him that “he
read his canons under Germanus.” The chronology of the next
twelve years of his life is exceedingly confused, but he is stated to
have been sent by Germanus to study in an island in the Mediterranean
Sea, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in mari Tyrrheno</i>, which was evidently Lerins. Nennius
adds that he also visited Rome, and spent nearly eight years there,
“reading and searching into the mysteries of God, and studying the
books of Holy Scripture.” The length of time spent by him in Rome
appears uncertain, but most writers agree on the point of his having
visited the city, and of his being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romanis eruditus disciplinis</i>. Having
returned to Germanus, he is said to have accompanied him in his first
visit to Britain, and was afterwards sent back to Rome by that holy
prelate, who recommended him to Pope St. Celestine as a fit person
to be employed in the Irish mission. The endless differences to be
found in the various versions of his life do not affect the main facts
here established, namely, that he acquired his ecclesiastical training
in the first schools then existing in Christendom&mdash;those of Tours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Auxerre, Lerins, and Rome&mdash;and that his institution to the apostolic
office was received from the hands of the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>On his journey through Gaul we are told by Jocelin that he turned
out of his road in order to pay a farewell visit to “his nurse and
teacher,” St. Germanus, who furnished him with a welcome supply of
chalices, priestly vestments, and books. The same writer adds that
he was accompanied into Ireland by twenty Roman clerics, but it
appears probable that his companions were chiefly gathered in Gaul
and Britain, and Lanigan mercilessly reduces their number from
twenty to two. Passing over the circumstances of his first arrival on
the Irish coast, and his ineffectual efforts to convert his old master
Milcho, we next find the saint in the neighbourhood of Down
Patrick, where he instructed, baptized, and tonsured a young disciple
named Mochoe, to whom he also taught the Roman alphabet. This
last-named incident is one of very frequent recurrence in the life of
St. Patrick. Nennius indeed affirms that he wrote no less than 365
alphabets;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> but, as Bishop Lloyd quaintly remarks, “the writers of
those times, when they were upon the pin of multiplying, used generally
to say that things were as many as the days of the year.” It is
quite certain, however, that this teaching of the Roman alphabet,
the first step necessary for acquiring a knowledge of Latin, formed a
very common item in the instruction of the Irish converts. We are
not to conclude from this with the Bollandists, that previous to the
arrival of St. Patrick the Irish possessed no knowledge of written
characters, but it is at least clear that the apostle of Ireland considered
it a part of his office to diffuse among the people committed
to his pastoral care a knowledge of the letters, as well as of the faith
of Rome. He also received into his company a number of young
disciples, who, after being instructed in the faith, were gradually
admitted to holy orders, and given the care of the newly-formed
congregation. Thus, on his road to the great festival of Tara, which
fills so conspicuous a place in the history of the saint, he preached
the faith to a certain man whose young son Benan, or Benignus, fell
at his feet weeping, and desiring ever to be in his company; and the
saint, with the consent of his parents, received him as his disciple,
or, as he is elsewhere called, his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alumnus</i>. This event took place on
Good Friday; on the following Easter Sunday, when St. Patrick was
invited to Tara to hold a conference with the pagan priests in presence
of the king, the young neophyte, robed in white, carried the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
book of the gospels before his master, who advanced with his clergy
in solemn procession, chanting an Irish hymn which he had composed
for the occasion.</p>

<p>At another time a pious mother brought him her son Lananus,
whom St. Patrick delivered to St. Cassan to be instructed in all
good learning; and such was the ardour with which the boy applied
himself to study, that in fifteen days he had learned the entire
Psalter.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Again, Enda of Westmeath is represented entrusting his
son Cormac to the care of the saint, to be educated by him; and he
himself, in his confession, alludes to the sons of the kings who
journeyed about with him (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui mecum ambulant</i>). For this first
seminary was not fixed in any college or monastery, but, as the
above words imply, was formed of those who accompanied the
apostle of Ireland in his ceaseless wanderings over the country.
Popular accounts, indeed, generally represent him as founding at
least a hundred monasteries, and even those who consider that the
greater number of the Irish colleges were raised by his followers
after his death, admit the fact of his having established an episcopal
monastery and school at Armagh, where he and his clergy carried
out the same rule of life that he had seen followed in the churches
of Gaul. The government of this monastery was committed in the
first instance to Benignus, who afterwards succeeded St. Patrick in
the primacy.</p>

<p>The school, which formed a portion of the Cathedral establishment,
soon rose in importance. Gildas taught here for some years
before joining St. Cadoc at Llancarvan; and in process of time the
number of students, both native and foreign, so increased that the
university, as we may justly call it, was divided into three parts, one
of which was devoted entirely to students of the Anglo-Saxon race.
Grants for the support of the schools were made by the Irish
kings in the eighth century; and all through the troublous times of
the ninth and tenth centuries, when Ireland was overrun by the
Danes, and so many of her sanctuaries were given to the flames, the
succession of divinity professors at Armagh remained unbroken, and
has been carefully traced by Usher. We need not stop to determine
how many other establishments similar to those of Armagh
were really founded in the lifetime of St. Patrick. In any case the
rapid extension of the monastic institute in Ireland, and the extraordinary
ardour with which the Irish cœnobites applied themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
to the cultivation of letters remain undisputed facts. “Within a
century after the death of St. Patrick,” says Bishop Nicholson, “the
Irish seminaries had so increased that most parts of Europe sent
their children to be educated here, and drew thence their bishops
and teachers.” The whole country for miles round Leighlin was
denominated the “land of saints and scholars.” By the ninth century
Armagh could boast of 7000 students, and the schools of
Cashel, Dindaleathglass, and Lismore vied with it in renown. This
extraordinary multiplication of monastic seminaries and scholars
may be explained partly by the constant immigration of British
refugees who brought with them the learning and religious observances
of their native cloisters, and partly by that sacred and
irresistible impulse which animates a newly converted people to
heroic acts of sacrifice. In Ireland the infant church was not, as elsewhere,
watered with the blood of martyrs; it was, perhaps, the only
European country in which Christianity was firmly established without
the faithful having to pass through the crucible of persecution.
And hence the burning devotion which elsewhere swelled the white-robed
army of martyrs, but which here found no such vent, sent its
thousands to people the deserts and the rocky islands of the west,
and filled the newly raised cloisters of Ireland with a countless
throng who gave themselves to the slower martyrdom of penance
and love. The bards, who were to be found in great numbers
among the early converts of St. Patrick, had also a considerable
share in directing the energies of their countrymen to intellectual
labour. They formed the learned class, and on their conversion to
Christianity were readily disposed to devote themselves to the culture
of sacred letters. At the Easter festival at Tara, already alluded
to, the first convert gained by St. Patrick was Dubtach, the arch-priest
and poet of the country. His conversion took place in 433,
and after that time he devoted his talents to the service of the faith,
and taught whatever science he possessed to a school of Christian
disciples.</p>

<p>It would be impossible, within the limits of a single chapter, to
notice even the names of all the Irish seats of learning, or of their
most celebrated teachers, every one of whom has his own legend in
which sacred and poetic beauties are to be found blended together.
One of the earliest monastic schools was that erected by Enda, prince
of Orgiel, in that western island called from the wild flowers which
even still cover its rocky soil, Aran-of-the-Flowers, a name it afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
exchanged for that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ara-na-naomh</i>, or Aran-of-the Saints.
There may yet be seen the rude stone church of the sixth century
within which rest the bodies of the 127 saints of Aran, and at no
great distance the remains of small beehive houses which served as
the abode of the monks. According to Lanigan, who is seldom disposed
to assign a very early date to the monastic establishments of
Ireland, the foundation of Enda cannot be fixed later than the year
480. It became the nursery of some of the greatest Irish teachers,
and was also the resort of students from beyond the sea. Hither
came St. Carthag the elder, St. Kieran, and St. Brendan. Here too
St. Fursey spent many years in solitude before going forth to found
his monasteries in England and France, and here he at last returned
from his splendid cloisters of Lagne on the Marne to end his days
and be laid to rest in the rude sanctuary of the “Four beautiful
Saints.” Nor does the holy soil of Aran fail to cherish a remembrance
of St. Columba the Great. He came here before undertaking his
mission to North Britain, and his admiration for the Isle of Saints
is commemorated in verses wherein he declares that to sleep on the
dust of Aran and within the sound of her church-bells is as desirable
as to be laid to rest on the threshold of the Apostles.</p>

<p>A little later St. Finian founded his great school of Clonard, whence,
says Usher, issued forth a stream of saints and doctors, like the Greek
warriors from the wooden horse. Finian was baptized and instructed
by one of the immediate disciples of St. Patrick, and after studying
under various Irish masters he passed over into Britain, and there
formed an intimate friendship with St. David, St. Gildas, and St.
Cadoc. He remained for several years in Britain, and on returning
to his own country founded several religious houses, in one of which
he lectured on the Holy Scriptures for seven years. At last, about
the year 530, he fixed his residence in the desert of Clonard in
Westmeath, which had up to that time been the resort of a huge
wild boar. This desolate wilderness was soon peopled by his disciples,
who are said to have numbered 3000, of whom the twelve
most eminent are often termed the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.
Finian himself is commonly spoken of as the Master of Saints, and
is esteemed, next to St. Patrick, as the greatest doctor of the Irish
Church. “He was,” says the writer of his life, “replenished with
all science as a learned scribe to teach the law of God; and he was
most compassionate and charitable, weeping with those that wept
and mildly healing the bodies and souls of all who applied to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
He slept on the bare ground with a stone under his head, and ate
nothing but bread and herbs,” and his disciples followed the same
severe manner of life. Among them none were more famous than
St. Columba, St. Kieran, and St. Brendan. The first of these is
known to every English reader as the founder of Iona; and Kieran,
the carpenter’s son, as he is called, is scarcely less renowned among
his own countrymen. Some anecdotes are told of the school life of
these two great men, in which the youthful infirmities<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> so frankly
recorded of both will certainly not prejudice our opinion of their
future sanctity. A school in those days was not exactly arranged
after the fashion of Eton or Rugby: the scholars worked for their
own maintenance and that of the house; and under monastic masters
this initiation into the holy law of labour was never spared even to
those of princely blood. The prince and the peasant were accustomed
to work and study side by side; and so it was in the school of
Clonard. Columba was of royal extraction, while Kieran was of
humble birth. The first task assigned the young prince was to
sift the corn that was to serve for next day’s provision, and to the
surprise of his more plebeian associates he accomplished it so neatly
and with such rapidity that they all declared he must have been
helped by an angel. Royal and noble scholars, however, are
seldom popular in public schools, and Columba had not a little to
endure from his companions on the score of his gentle blood. He
exacted a deference from them which Kieran in particular would not
submit to, and the result was a continual bickering. But at last,
says the old legend, an angel appeared to Kieran, and laying before
him a carpenter’s rule and other instruments of his trade, said to
him, “Behold what thou hast renounced in giving up the world, but
Columba has forsaken a royal sceptre.” The good heart of the
carpenter’s son was touched with this reproach, and from that time
he and Columba only contended in the generous rivalry of the
saints.</p>

<p>Of St. Columba’s apostolic mission to North Britain we shall presently
have occasion to speak; but first we must trace the fortunes of
his schoolfellow, Kieran, who became the founder of another of the
most renowned schools of Ireland. Kieran’s future sanctity had
been detected by the quick eye of St. Finian before he left Clonard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
One day as he was studying St. Matthew’s Gospel, having come
upon the sentence, “All things that ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye to them also,” he closed the book, saying, “This is
enough for me.” One of his comrades, jesting with him, observed,
“Then we shall call you not Kieran, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leth-Matha</i> (half-Matthew),
for you have stopped in the middle of the Gospel.” “No,” said
Finian, who overheard the remark, “call him rather <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leth-Nerion</i>
(half-Ireland), for one-half of this island shall be his,”&mdash;a prophecy
which was fulfilled when half the Irish monasteries accepted his rule.
After leaving Clonard, Kieran, having received his master’s blessing
and license, repaired to an island in the lake of Erne, where he
spent some time studying under St. Nennidius, another of the Clonard
scholars. At last he found his way to Aran, where Enda, who was
still living, received him joyfully, and employed him during the
intervals of study in threshing out the corn for the use of the other
monks. After remaining there seven years he founded two great
monasteries, one of which was situated on the west bank of the
Shannon, at a spot called Cluain-Mac-Nois,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> or the Retreat of the
Sons of the Noble. This foundation took place about the year 548,
and thence the austere rule or law of Kieran spread into a vast
number of other religious houses.</p>

<p>It is indeed worthy of note that all the great masters of the Irish
schools were followers of the most severe monastic discipline. The
nurseries of science were often enough the rude cave, or forest hut
of some holy hermit, such as St. Fintan, the founder of Cluain-Ednech,
or the Ivy Cave, near Mount Bladin in Queen’s County;
whose disciples lived on herbs and roots, laboured in the fields, and,
like the monks of Menevia, renounced the assistance of cattle. Yet
Abbot Fintan was a polished scholar, and particularly noted for his
skill as a logician; and learned men came in crowds to the Ivy Cave
to perfect themselves in sacred science and the rules of a holy life.
One of Fintan’s most celebrated scholars was St. Comgall, who in
559 became the founder of Benchor, near the bay of Carrickfergus.
The fame of this great school of learning and religion has been
celebrated by St. Bernard, who, in his “Life of St. Malachi,” speaks
of the swarm of saints who came forth from Benchor, and spread
themselves like an inundation into foreign lands. In the Latin hymn
of its old Antiphonary it is extolled as the ship beaten with the
waves, the house founded on the rock, the true vine transplanted out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
of Egypt whose rule is at once holy and learned, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">simplex simul atque
docta</i>. The most famous of its scholars was St. Columbanus, the
founder of Luxeuil in Burgundy and of Bobbio in Italy, whose rule
spread over most European countries, and promised at one time to
rival that of St. Benedict. The letters of Columbanus prove him to
have been “a man of three tongues,” to use the ordinary term applied
in old times to one who added to his Greek, Hebrew. His acquaintance
with the Latin poets is evident in his letter to Hunaldus, and
his familiarity with those of Greece in his poetical epistle to Fedolius.
And as he was fifty years of age before he left his native land, it is
certain that his learning must have been entirely gained in her native
seminaries. Another of the Benchor scholars was Molua, or Luanus,
as he is called by St. Bernard, who tells us that he founded at least
a hundred monasteries. The story of his first introduction to St.
Comgall has been often told, but is one of those that can scarcely
be told too often. He was keeping his flocks on the mountain-side,
when Comgall, attracted by his appearance, wrote out the alphabet
for him on a slate, and seeing his eagerness to learn, took him to
Benchor and placed him in the school. Luanus conceived such a
thirst for the waters of science that he prayed night and day that he
might become learned. The prudent abbot, while he admired the
zeal of his new scholar, was not without some anxiety lest his craving
after human learning might sully the purity of his soul. One day
he beheld the boy seated at the feet of an angel, who was showing
him his letters and encouraging him to study. Calling Luanus to
him, he said, “My child, thou hast asked a perilous gift from God;
many, out of undue love of knowledge, have made shipwreck of their
souls.” “My father,” replied Luanus, with the utmost humility, “if I
learn to know God I shall never offend Him, for those only offend
Him who know him not.” “Go, my son,” said the abbot, charmed
with his reply, “remain firm in the faith, and the true science shall
conduct thee on the road to heaven.”</p>

<p>Luanus was the founder of the monastery of Clonfert, in Leinster,
and the author of another religious rule highly prized by his countrymen.
The no less celebrated school of Clonfert, in Connaught,
owed its foundation to St. Brendan, the fellow-student of Kieran
and Columba. Having passed some years under the direction of
St. Jarlath at Tuam, and St. Finian at Clonard, and become as
familiar with Greek as he was with Latin, he is declared by his
historians to have set sail on a voyage in search of the Land of Promise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
which lasted seven years. In the course of these wanderings
by sea he discovered a vast tract of land lying far to the west of
Ireland, where he beheld wonderful birds, and trees of unknown
foliage, which gave forth the perfumes of such excellent spices, that
the fragrance thereof still clung to the garments of the travellers
when they returned to their native shores.</p>

<p>But it is time to speak of the Irish monastic patriot, whose name
is known in our own time, as it was probably revered in his own,
beyond any of those that have hitherto been mentioned. It was in
the year 563 that St. Columba,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> after founding the monasteries of
Doire-Calgaich and Dair-magh in his native land, and incurring the
enmity of one of the Irish kings, determined on crossing over into
Scotland in order to preach the faith to the Northern Picts.
Accompanied by twelve companions, he passed the Channel in a rude
wicker boat covered with skins, and landed at Port-na Currachan,
on a spot now marked by a heap of huge conical stones. Conall,
king of the Albanian Scots, granted him the island of I, Hi, or Ai,
hitherto occupied by the Druids, and there he erected the monastery
which, in time, became the mother of three hundred religious houses.
If Johnson felt his piety grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona, we
surely cannot be indifferent while contemplating the site of that
missionary college which educated so many of our early apostles,
and diffused the light of faith from Lindisfarne to the Hebrides.
The life led by its inmates was at once apostolic and contemplative.
If at one time the monks of Iona were to be met with travelling
through the islands and highlands of Scotland, preaching the
faith and administering baptism where no Christian missionaries had
hitherto penetrated, at others they were to be seen tilling the soil,
teaching in their schools, and transcribing manuscripts. In whatever
labours they engaged, Columba himself was the first to lead the
way. “He suffered no space of time,” says Adamnan, “no, not an
hour, to pass in which he was not employed either in prayer, or in
reading, or writing, or manual work. And so unwearied was his
labour both by day and night, that it seemed as if the weight of
every particular work of his seemed to exceed the power of man.”
He penetrated into the Hebrides, and twice revisited his native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
shores, but on his return from such expeditions he loved to take
part in the agricultural or scholastic pursuits of his brethren. He
would hear them read or himself read to them, and overlook their
work in the Scriptorium, where he required the most scrupulous
exactitude. He himself was a skilful penman, and the magnificent
Codex of Kells, still preserved in the library of Trinity College, is
known to have been written by his hand. Iona, or I-Colum-kil, as
it was called by the Irish, came to be looked on as the chief seat of
learning, not only in Britain, but in the whole Western world.
“Thither, as from a nest,” says Odonellus, playing on the Latin
name of the founder, “these sacred doves took their flight to every
quarter.” They studied the classics, the mechanical arts, law, history,
and physic. They improved the arts of husbandry and horticulture,
supplied the rude people whom they had undertaken to
civilise with ploughshares and other utensils of labour, and taught
them the use of the forge, in the mysteries of which every Irish
monk was instructed from his boyhood. They transferred to their
new homes all the learning of Armagh or Clonard. Of St. Munn,
one of the pupils of Columba, it is said that he spent eighteen years
in uninterrupted study, yet this devotion to intellectual pursuits was
accompanied by a singular simplicity and love of poverty. Wherever
the apostles of Iona appeared, they carried with them the reputation
of frugality and self-devotion. Thus Bede remarks on the
extreme simplicity of life observed by Bishop Colman and his
disciples, how they were content with the simple fare, “because it
was the study of their teachers to feed the soul rather than the
body.” “And for that reason,” he continues, “the religious habit
was then held in great veneration, and wherever any monk appeared,
he was joyfully received as God’s servant; and if men chanced to
meet him on the way they ran to him bowing, glad to be signed with
his hand and blessed by his mouth. And when a priest came to
any village the inhabitants immediately flocked to hear from him the
Word of Life, for they went about on no other account than to
preach, baptize, visit the sick, and take care of souls.”</p>

<p>In every college of Irish origin, by whomsoever they were founded
or on whatever soil they flourished, we thus see study blended with
the duties of the missionary and the cœnobite. They were religious
houses, no doubt, in which the celebration of the Church office was
often kept up without intermission by day and night; but they were
also seminaries of learning, wherein sacred and profane studies were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
cultivated with equal success. Not only their own monasteries but
those of every European country were enriched with their manuscripts,
and the researches of modern bibliopolists are continually
disinterring from German or Italian libraries a Horace, or an Ovid,
or a Sacred Codex whose Irish gloss betrays the hand which traced
its delicate letters. The Hibernian scholars were remarkable for
combining acuteness of the reasoning powers with the gifts of the
musician and the poet. There were no more accurate mathematicians
and no keener logicians than the sons of Erin, whose love of
syllogism is spoken of in the ninth century by St. Benedict of Anian.
They are admitted to have been the precursors of the mediæval
schoolmen, and to have been the first to apply the subtleties of
Greek philosophy to Christian dogma. Their love of Greek was,
perhaps, excessive, for they evinced it by Hellenising their Latin, and
occasionally writing even their Latin missals in the Greek character.
In the disputes that arose on the subject of the Paschal computation,
they astonished their adversaries with their arithmetical science
and their linguistic erudition. St. Cummian, in the Paschal epistle
wherein he so ably defends the Roman system, examines all the
various cycles in use among the Jews, Greeks, Latins, and Egyptians;
quotes passages from Greek and Latin fathers, and manifestly proves
how well the libraries of Ireland were furnished, and how competent
her scholars were to use them. Nor whilst cultivating the exact
sciences did they abandon the muses. Both St. Columbia and St.
Columbanus enjoyed a reputation as poets. St. Ængus, the martyrologist,
began life as a professional bard, and did not lay aside his
harp when he assumed the cowl of the cœnobite; while Ruman, the
son of Colman, was called “the Virgil of Ireland,” and is described
as an “adept in chronology, history, and poetry.” Rhyme, if not
invented in Ireland, was at least adopted by her versifiers so
generally, and at so early a period, as sometimes to be designated
“the art of the Irish;” and, as Moore observes, the peculiar structure
of their verse shows that it belonged to a people of strong
musical feeling. Hence they soon became famous for their skill in
psalmody, and were esteemed both at home and abroad as first-rate
choir-masters; and the legends of the Irish saints are full of passages
which describe the kind of ecstasy produced in the minds of this
people, so susceptible to the beautiful in every form, by the melody of
the ecclesiastical chant. We will give one of these stories, because it
introduces us to the founder of the school of Lismore, the last of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the great Irish seminaries which we shall notice in this place.
Though said to be of noble extraction, Mochuda was employed by
a chief in the humble capacity of swineherd. One day as he tended
his herd by the banks of the river Mang, he was rapt out of himself
by a sight and a sound of beauty altogether new to him. It was the
holy bishop St. Carthag the elder, accompanied by a procession of
his clergy, who as they went along made the hills of Kerry re-echo
to the Psalm-tones, ever ancient and ever new, of the Gregorian
chant. St. Augustine has confessed to their power over his heart,
and the poor Irish swineherd was not less enraptured by their beauty
than the African rhetorician had been. Drawn along, as it were, by
the charm of the melody, he left his herd in the fields and followed
the singers to their monastery. All night he remained outside the
gates, catching at intervals the distant sound of the night office,
till when morning dawned he was found there by his master
Moelthuili, who desired to know why he had not returned home in
the evening as was usual. “Because I was charmed with the holy
songs of the servants of God,” replied Mochuda, “and I desire
nothing else on earth than that I also may learn to sing those songs.”
Moelthuili, who loved the boy, made him large promises of favour
if he would remain in his service, but finding his words unheeded,
he at last took him to the bishop and begged him to receive the
youth among his disciples. St. Carthag bestowed his own name
upon him, and admitted him among his scholars, and in process of
time the fame of the pupil surpassed even that of his master. In
630 St. Carthag the younger, as he is called, became the founder of
Lismore, the fame of whose schools extended into Italy.</p>

<p>“One-half of this holy city,” says an ancient writer, “is a sanctuary
into which no woman may enter; it is full of cells and monasteries,
and religious men resort thither from all parts of Ireland and
England.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> One of the most famous masters of Lismore was St.
Cathal or Cataldus, the patron saint of Tarentum in Italy, and his
numerous biographies in prose and verse never fail to commemorate
the glories of his Alma Mater.</p>

<p>Whatever exaggeration may have been committed by the national
annalists when they speak of the foreign students who resorted to
the Irish schools, it is impossible to doubt that they were eagerly
sought by nations of the most distant lands, who, in an age when
the rest of Europe was sunk in illiterate barbarism, found in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
cloisters of Armagh, Lismore, Clonard, and Clonmacnois, masters of
philosophy and sacred science whose learning had passed into a
proverb. Camden remarks how common a thing it is to read in the
lives of our English saints that they were sent to study in Ireland,
and the same expression occurs quite as frequently in the Gallican
histories. The prodigious Litany of the Saints, composed in the
eighth century by St. Ængus, includes the names not only of Britons,
Picts, and Saxons, but also of Gauls, Germans, Romans, and
Egyptians, all buried in Ireland. The tomb of the “Seven Romans”
may still be seen in the churchyard of St. Brecan in the Isle of Aran,
and a church at Meath was commonly known as the Greek Church,
so called from having been served by Greek ecclesiastics. Even in
the eleventh century the fame of the Irish schools was undiminished,
and Sulgenus, bishop of St. David’s, spent ten years studying under
their best masters.</p>

<p>Great as was the learning of the Irish scholars, it had in it a
certain character of its own. Their theology was deeply tinged with a
metaphysical spirit, and in their grammar, no less than their poetry,
they displayed a taste for the mystic and the obscure. This is partly
to be attributed to the influence of the Toulouse academicians,
with whom the Irish scholars eagerly fraternised. They seem to have
found something unspeakably attractive in the bizarre language of
the twelve Latinities and the novelties of the Toulouse prosody.
The strange jargon in which some of their professors were accustomed
to indulge occasionally steals into the Hibernian hymns and antiphons;
and the Anglo-Saxons who flocked in such multitudes to the
Irish seminaries, were not slow in catching the infection. They soon
learnt to disfigure their pages with a jumble of Greek, Latin, and
Anglo-Saxon syllables, and to expend their patience and ingenuity
over compositions in which the great achievement was to produce
fifteen consecutive words beginning with a P.</p>

<p>If Ireland gave hospitality in these remote ages to men of all
tongues and races, she in her turn sent forth her swarms of saints
who have left their traces in countless churches founded by them in
Gaul, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The children of St. Columbanus
reformed the Austrasian clergy, and were the first apostles of
the Rhetian wildernesses. At Fiesole, in Tuscany, we find the Irish
St. Donatus, compelled by the people to accept the office of bishop,
and restoring, at one and the same time, sacred studies and ecclesiastical
discipline. The myrtle bowers of Ausonia, however, did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
not make him forget his native land, for in some Latin verses which
Moore has thought worthy of translation, he dwells like a true patriot
on the praises of that remote western island, so rich in gems and
precious metals, where the fields flow with milk and honey, and the
lowing herds and golden harvests supply all the wants of man. At
Lucca the English traveller is still startled to find the relics of his
own Anglo-Saxon countrymen, St. Richard and St. Winibald, preserved
and venerated in a church dedicated to the Irish bishop, St.
Frigidian. And whilst the southern shores of Italy were welcoming
the coming of St. Cataldus, Iceland and the distant Orcades were
receiving missionaries of the same Celtic race.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Hereafter we shall see the scholars of Ireland taking part in the
Carlovingian revival of learning, and making it their boast that the
two first universities of Europe, those of Paris and Pavia, owed their
foundation in no small degree to Hibernian professors. But before
that era dawned, they had found rivals, both in their literary and
apostolic labours, in the Anglo-Saxon race. The “sea-dragons of
Germany,” who had extinguished faith and civilisation in the British
provinces which they had overrun and conquered, had received anew
those precious gifts from the hands of a great pope, whose instinctive
genius led him to transfer to this remote corner of the world
the sciences which were fast dying out of the Italian and Gallican
schools. The story has been often told, but the course of our history
obliges us to tell it over again in the following chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Donatist heresy was still raging in Africa; the Arians were
triumphant in Spain and Northern Italy; a miserable schism arising
out of the affair of the Three Chapters was vexing the Istrian provinces;
France was torn by intestine wars, and the imperial power which
nominally held rule in Italy was fast crumbling to pieces; the almost
civilised dominion of the Ostrogoths had been exchanged for the
wild barbarism of the half pagan, half Arian Lombards; floods,
plague, and famine were rapidly depopulating the southern peninsula,
when, in the year 590, St. Gregory the Great was placed in the
chair of St. Peter, and received into his hands the destinies of the
Western world.</p>

<p>“There are,” says the German philosopher, Frederic Schlegel,
“grand and pregnant epochs in the history of the world, in which all
existing relations assume a new and unexpected form. At such
junctures, God Himself seems, as it were, to interfere, and establish
a theocracy.” Such was the epoch of which we speak. All the
power of human government had come to nought, and while men’s
hearts were failing them for fear, the reins were falling into the hands
of a frail and feeble monk, worn out with sickness and austerity, and
so little conscious of possessing in himself the capacity of ruling,
that, when the unanimous voice of clergy and people raised him to
the pontifical dignity, he fled in terror to the woods, and was
brought back weeping, and giving vent to his anguish in accents
almost of despair. It will suffice very briefly to remind the reader
what kind of pontificate it was that was thus begun. During the
fourteen years that St. Gregory governed the Church, he achieved
greatness enough to furnish fame to a dozen autocrats. He defended
Rome from the Lombards, and the Lombards themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
from the treachery of the Eastern emperors; he won them from
Arianism, extirpated Donatism from Africa, and put an end to the
Istrian schism. Whilst providing for the necessities of the Italian
provinces, desolated by the cruel calamities of the times, he firmly
resisted the exactions of the Byzantine court, and maintained the
independence of the Church against the Cæsars. From the effete
civilisation of the corrupt East, he turned to the new and semi-barbarous
races of the West,&mdash;taught the Frankish kings the duties
of Christian sovereignty, and urged their bishops to wage war against
ecclesiastical abuses. His prodigious correspondence carried his
paternal care into the most distant provinces. He condemned
slavery, defended the peasants, and protected even the Jews. And
in the midst of these multifarious labours, he found time to preach
and write for future ages also. Thirty-five books of “Morals,” thirteen
volumes of Epistles, forty Homilies on the gospels, twenty-two on the
prophet Ezechiel, an immortal treatise on the Pastoral care, four
books of Dialogues, and the reformation of the Sacramentary or ritual
of the Church, are the chief works left us by the Fourth Latin Doctor.
Nevertheless, as most readers must be aware, there exists a certain
tradition which represents this great pope as the enemy of learning,
a tradition elaborated out of the rebuke administered by him to
Didier, Bishop of Vienne, on occasion of that prelate having delivered
lectures on the profane poets, and the supposed fact of his
having burnt the Palatine Library, a fact which, however, remained
without record until six centuries had elapsed.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> We need not pause
to examine charges which, however often refuted or explained, will
always find credence among a certain class of writers and readers,
who cling to a time-honoured <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mumpsimus</i>. But it was necessary to
recognise the existence of this view of his character before presenting
the supposed destroyer of the Palatine Library as the undoubted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
founder of a Palatine school. And first we will hear how his
biographer, John the Deacon, describes his manner of life. After
naming several of the ecclesiastics, whom he chose as his chief
councillors, among whom occur the names of Paul the Deacon, and
our English apostles, Augustine and Mellitus, he goes on to relate
how, in company with these, St. Gregory contrived to carry out
monastical perfection within the walls of his own palace. “Learned
clerks and religious monks,” he says, “lived there in common with
their pontiff, so that the same rule was exhibited in Rome in the
time of St. Gregory as St. Luke describes as existing in Jerusalem
under the Apostles, and Philo records as established by St. Mark at
Alexandria.”</p>

<p>These clerks assisted St. Gregory in his learned labours. Some
were notaries, who wrote out his Homilies under his direction; and
Paul the Deacon is introduced as the interlocutor in his Dialogues.
And the historian goes on to tell us, that out of the canonical life
established in the pontifical palace, there sprang a school. “Then
did wisdom visibly fabricate to herself a temple,” he continues,
“supporting the porticoes of the apostolic see by the seven liberal
arts as by columns formed of the most precious stones. In the
family of the pontiff, no one from the least to the greatest, dared
utter a barbarous word; the purest Latinity, such as had been
spoken in the time of the best Roman writers, was alone permitted
to find another Latium in his palace. There, the study of all the
liberal arts once more flourished, and he who was conscious to himself
that he was wanting either in holiness or learning, dared not
show his face in presence of the pontiff.” He goes on to speak of
the number of learned men constantly to be found in the company
of the pope, who encouraged poor philosophy rather than rich idleness.
But he confesses that one thing was wanting: the “Cecropian
muse” was absent; in other words, there was no one skilful in the
interpretation of Greek.</p>

<p>In addition to this Palatine academy, if I should not rather say in
connection with it, St. Gregory founded a school destined to have
a more world-wide influence and more lasting fame. The extraordinary
diligence bestowed by the holy pontiff on the reformation
of the ecclesiastical chant gave rise in after times to a graceful legend,
which represented him as visited in his sleep by a tenth Muse, who
appeared to him with her mantle covered with the mystic notes and
neumas, and inspired him with that skill in science of sacred melody,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
which he ever afterwards possessed. The legend, like most legends,
only embalms and beautifies a fact. The Church was the real Muse
who inspired her pontiff to give to her order of sacred chant the
same perfection he had already bestowed upon her Liturgy. Other
popes and prelates had laboured before him at the same work, and
indeed the very name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centon</i>, which is given to his Antiphonary,
shows that it was a compilation of those ancient melodies which
passed from the Temple to the Church, and which may be traced
through St. Mark at Alexandria, and through St. Ignatius at Antioch,
up to St. Peter himself.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In process of time the Eastern churches
introduced a more pompous and florid style, but in Africa, thanks
to the exertions of St. Athanasius, the ancient severity was preserved,
and made matter of reproach against the Catholics by the Donatist
heretics, who attributed it to the natural heaviness and stupidity of
the African character. Baronius observes that, according to the
most ancient monuments, the Roman Church appears to have taken
the middle course, between the extreme simplicity of the Africans
and the florid ornamentation of the Orientals, and thus united gravity
with sweetness.</p>

<p>St. Ambrose, who introduced the chant into Milan, permitted
women to join in the chanting of the Psalms, a custom which degenerated
in some churches into the establishment of female choirs;
though this abuse was prohibited by many popes and councils.
Everywhere the bishops encouraged the cultivation of the chant, and
Fortunatus describes St. Germanus of Paris presiding in the apse of
the Golden Church, and directing the singing of his two choirs.
But, as St. Augustine remarks in one of his letters, no uniformity
existed among the different churches, and both variations and corruptions
were introduced according to the genius of different nations.
Hence, the reformation of the Cantus, and the establishment of some
uniform standard based on the ancient models, had engaged the
attention of several popes before the time of St. Gregory, and particularly
of St. Gelasius and St. Damasus. St. Gregory completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
their work: he collected in his Centon, or Antiphonary, all the
ancient fragments still existing, corrected and arranged them with
his own pen, and added some original compositions, bearing the
same character of majestic simplicity with the venerable melodies
on which they were formed. And finally, to secure the permanence
of these reforms, and to extend the use of the ecclesiastical chant
throughout the Church, he founded a school which, three centuries
later, still survived and flourished. “After the manner of a wise
Solomon,” says John the Deacon, “being touched by the sweetness
of music, he carefully compiled his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centon</i> or Antiphonary of chants,
and established a school of those chants which had hitherto been
sung in the Roman Church, and built for this purpose two houses,
one attached to the Church of St. Peter the Apostle, and the other
near the Lateran Patriarchium, where, up to this day, are preserved,
with becoming veneration, the couch whereon he was accustomed
to rest when singing, and the rod with which he was wont to threaten
the boys, together with the authentic copy of his Antiphonary.”</p>

<p>The important place which the Roman school of chant occupied
in the history of Christian education will be seen in the following
pages. Its value in our own day can hardly be appreciated, for the
training of Christendom has long since ceased to be liturgical. But
an era was about to open on the world during which the human
intellect was no longer to receive its shape and colouring from
the forms, however beautiful, of pagan antiquity, but from that
Christian Muse whom our English poet has invoked. St. Gregory
lived at a time when the old empire, with its letters and civilisation,
was fast passing away. The little stone had struck the statue, and
the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, had been
carried away by the wind, and become as the chaff on the summer’s
threshing-floor. He beheld new races rising out of the dust of fallen
empires. What now are Homer and Horace to the grim Goth or
savage Lombard who has spent his life in beating to pieces with his
battle-axe the fairest monuments of Greece and Rome? To him no
inspiration will flow from Castaly or Parnassus.</p>

<p class="noindent">and the name of Woden is far more venerable in his eyes than that
of Apollo. But there is <em>One</em> Power that has caught him in its golden
nets and holds his soul a willing captive. When the waters of baptism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
flowed over his brow he was brought face to face with that mighty
Mother from whose hands he was to receive the knowledge of letters,
and a far vaster education than the knowledge of letters alone can
ever give. Heart, will, imagination, and understanding, all found
their teacher in the Church of the Living God. Her sacred offices
appealed to his soul through a thousand avenues, by their inspired
ceremonial, their matchless poetry, their solemn melody, and their
pictured art. The following pages will sadly fail of their main object
if they do not succeed in conveying to the reader a faint notion of
that marvellous education which the Church supplied to countless
populations who, it may be, never learnt to read. Her Liturgy
became the class-book of the barbaric races: it was to them all, and
far more than all, that Homer or Ossian had been to the children of
a darker age. What wonder, then, that the study of its musical
language should be erected by them into a liberal art, and that those
who were receiving their civilisation from the Rome, not of the
Cæsars, but of the Popes, should welcome among them the teachers
of the Roman music with as great enthusiasm as ever Florence in
the fifteenth century, welcomed her professors of Greek?</p>

<p>The importance of St. Gregory’s foundation regarded from this
point of view will readily appear. It was in some sort the mother of
those grand liturgical schools which were afterwards to cover the
face of Europe, the erection of which in any country serves as an
epoch to mark the introduction or restoration of Christian letters.
Henceforth, for nine centuries at least, grammar and the Cantus, the
Latin tongue and the Roman music, were to take their places side
by side as the two indispensables of education. Up to this time
even the Christian learning had been coloured by a civilisation of
pagan growth; but a new era had now begun: the Holy Scriptures
and the Liturgy of the Church were to become to Christian Europe
what the profane poets had been to the ancient world&mdash;the fountains
of inspiration and the intellectual moulds wherein a new generation
was to be cast; and though scholars were far from abandoning
Virgil, yet for long ages the Muse of Solyma was to hold the mastery
in the schools.</p>

<p>This new era of letters may be said to commence with St. Gregory,
for the schools of Christian origin which existed before his time were
fast becoming extinct, and it was chiefly from the new foundation,
planted by him on English soil, that the torch of science was relit.
How truly was he termed the Great, this pontiff, prince, and tutor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
a barbarous world! Yet to conceive aright of his greatness we must
remember that his work was painfully wrought out in the midst of
continual bodily sufferings and mental troubles yet harder to bear.
He who may be said to have founded the temporal sovereignty of
the Roman Pontiffs had his throne in the midst of ruins. He delivered
his discourses on Ezechiel while the barbarous Lombards
were marching against his capital. He had to witness the Roman
nobles dragged off into slavery with ropes about their necks, to be
sold like dogs in the markets of Gaul. Then came the news that
Monte Cassino was in flames and its monks cast out as houseless
wanderers. “Woe is me!” he exclaims, “all Europe is in the hands
of the barbarians. Cities are cast down, villages in ruins, whole provinces
depopulated; the land has no longer men to cultivate it; and
the idolaters pursue us even to death.” Yet in this awful crisis his
mind was bent on effecting new conquests for the faith, and he was
planning the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons with the Lombards at
his gates. Many writers have not hesitated to ascribe the pertinacity
with which he carried out this, his favourite enterprise, to the profound
sagacity of an ecclesiastical politician, who foresaw that the
loyal devotion of the new converts to the Holy See would repair the
losses inflicted by the barbarians on the rest of Christendom. But
it may safely be affirmed that no mere natural acuteness could possibly
have predicted anything favourable from the dispositions which
had hitherto been manifested by the Anglo-Saxons. Ancient writers
are unanimous in classing them among the most savage of the
northern tribes. They slaughtered their captives taken in war, and
drove a lucrative trade by the sale of their countrymen, and even of
their own children, to foreign merchants. The courage which formed
their solitary virtue too often degenerated into a brutal ferocity, and
their notions of a future state were exceedingly faint. In Gaul they
were regarded with terror as barbarians of uncouth speech and
aspect, and strange stories were told of their reckless deeds of bloodshed
and cruelty. Gregory himself would probably have found it
difficult to explain the hold they had gained on his heart ever since
he first beheld the blue-eyed and golden-haired Angles in the market-place
of Rome. But from that moment the thought of them never
left him; and though frustrated in his purpose of himself becoming
their apostle, he made it a labour of love to provide for their conversion
by other hands.</p>

<p>His first plan had been a sort of anticipation of the system since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
so successfully carried out by the Roman Propaganda. He conceived
the idea of redeeming a certain number of the Anglo-Saxon
youths annually brought into the slave-markets of Gaul, educating
them in some monastery school, and then sending them back as
missionaries to their own country. We are not told why this scheme
was abandoned, but in 596 the English mission was at last opened,
and a band of Roman monks, headed by St. Augustine, the former
prior of St. Gregory’s monastery set out for the barbarous and unknown
island. Never was any mission more amply cared for. St.
Gregory had poured out his whole heart upon it; he multiplied
letters to the bishops and Sovereigns of Gaul to secure his monks
hospitality on the road; his letters cheered them on their way, and
when the welcome tidings came that their work had begun under
prosperous auspices, he sent them a reinforcement of labourers
under the abbot Mellitus, bringing everything necessary for the
celebration of the Divine offices&mdash;sacred vessels, vestments, church
ornaments, holy relics, and “many books.”</p>

<p>A catalogue of the library which St. Augustine and his companions
brought with them into England is preserved at Trinity College,
Cambridge. It consisted of a Bible in two volumes, a Psalter and a
book of the Gospels, a Martyrology, the Apocryphal Lives of the
Apostles, and the Exposition of certain Epistles and Gospels. The
brief catalogue closes with these words: “These are the foundation
or beginning of the library of the whole English Church, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 601.”
These were the books sent to us by a Pope to be the beginning of
our national library, and from them did St. Augustine and his companions
begin to teach the English.</p>

<p>The manner of life to be adopted by the missionaries was plainly
laid down by St. Gregory in his instructions to St. Augustine. “You,
my brother,” he writes, “who have been brought up under monastic
rules, are not to live apart from your clergy in the English Church;
you are to follow that course of life which our forefathers did in the
time of the primitive church, when none of them said that anything
he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The ancient canonical life was to be the rule of the new clergy, and
measures were at once taken for carrying this precept into effect. A
monastery dedicated to SS. Peter and Paul was speedily founded at
Canterbury. In after years it bore the title of St. Augustine’s, and
obtained rare privileges as the first-born of our religious houses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
being designated “the Roman Chapel in England.” The abbot took
his place in general councils next to the abbot of Monte Cassino,
and the monastery was recognised as under the immediate jurisdiction
of the Holy See. Here, then, at one and the same time, began
the apostolic and scholastic labours of the missionaries. It was
not, indeed, until some years later, that the school of Canterbury
attained its full celebrity under the abbot Adrian, but thirty years
before his time it had become the model of other seminaries founded
in different parts of England. When Sigebert, King of the East
Angles, who had been baptized and instructed in France, wished to
set up a school for youth to be instructed in literature, “after the
good fashions he had seen in that country,” he sent to Canterbury
for his schoolmaster, and obtained one in the person of Felix the
Burgundian, who became the apostle of the East of England. At
this time the liberal sciences are said to have been cultivated at
Canterbury, and some writers persuade themselves that the school
of Bishop Felix was the germ of Cambridge University.</p>

<p>Northumbria was meanwhile receiving the light of faith from the
monks of Iona, who, being invited into his kingdom by St. Oswald,
in 635, despatched thither the holy bishop Aidan. He chose for the
site of his cathedral monastery the island of Lindisfarne, which soon
became the ecclesiastical capital of the north of England. This celebrated
spot, which is an island only at high tide, and is connected
with the mainland when the sea retires by a firm neck of sand,
doubtless bears at the present day an aspect very different from that
which it presented when the monks raised their first cathedral of oak-planks
thatched with reed. The ruins of a far statelier pile may now
be seen, built of dark-red sandstone, to which time has given a
melancholy hue not out of character with the scene. But there are
some features which time itself can never quite efface; the bold
promontories of the coast visible to the north and south, the wide
expanse of that tossing sea so often ploughed by the keels of the
Vikings, and those ruddy golden sands, are unchanged since the days
when the brethren of Lindisfarne raised their eyes, weary with the
labours of the Scriptorium, to rest them on that beautiful line of
wooded coast, or on the sparkling waves beyond it. Their manner
of life differed in no degree from that of their brethren at Iona. “It
was very different,” says Bede, “from the slothfulness of our times,
for all who bore company with Aidan, whether monks or laymen,
were employed either in studying the Scriptures or in singing Psalms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
This was his own daily employment wherever he went and if it happened
that he was invited to eat with the king, he went with one or
two clerks, and having taken a small repast, he made haste to be
gone with them either to read or write.” All the money that came
into his hands he employed in relieving the poor or ransoming slaves,
and many of the latter he made his disciples, instructing them and
advancing them to the ecclesiastical state.</p>

<p>Whilst the north was being thus evangelised by the disciples of St.
Columba, the south also had received a foundation of Hibernian
origin. In the wilds of Wiltshire a school had arisen round the cell
of Maidulf, an Irish recluse, who had been tempted to settle there
by the sylvan beauty of the spot, which was then surrounded by
thick luxuriant woods. To procure the means of support he received
scholars from the neighbourhood who supplied his scanty wants
and as his pupils increased his school became famous; and the
name of its teacher is preserved in that of the modern town of
Malmsbury. But it is remarkable how very soon both the Scottish
and Irish foundations became <em>Romanised</em>.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> One of the first scholars
of Lindisfarne was St. Wilfrid, who, not satisfied with the ecclesiastical
discipline of the Scottish monks, found his way to Canterbury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and there learnt the whole Psalter over again, according to the
Roman version, which differed from that used in the Northern
schools. He was joined by another North Country scholar, St.
Bennet Biscop, and the two set out together on a pilgrimage to
Rome.</p>

<p>The after history of these two saints was full of momentous results
to the Anglo-Saxon schools. At Rome Wilfrid studied the Scriptures,
the rules of ecclesiastical discipline, and the system of Paschal
computation under the Archdeacon Boniface, secretary to Pope
Martin I., and Scholasticus of the Lateran school. He returned to
England to found the Abbey of Ripon, into which he introduced the
Benedictine rule, and whither he invited Eddi, the chanter of Canterbury,
to come and teach his monks the Roman chant. Then he
set himself to reform the errors of the Northern churches, and thirty
years after the foundation of Lindisfarne, the Scottish discipline was,
by his vigorous exertions, exchanged for that of Rome. Biscop,
meanwhile, was not less busy. After his first visit to the Holy
City, he returned there a second time, and devoted himself not only
to ecclesiastical studies, but also to the acquisition of many useful
arts which he was resolved to plant in his native land. Next he
went to Lerins, where he received the habit of a monk, and spent
two years learning and practising the monastic rule; and then he
returned a third time to Rome, at the very moment when the death
of Deusdedit, sixth archbishop of Canterbury, had induced Pope
Vitalian to nominate as his successor the Greek scholar, Theodore.
He was a native of St. Paul’s city of Tarsus, and well skilled in all
human and divine literature. So says St. Bede, and so the Western
bishops seem to have thought, when they delayed drawing up their
synodal letter to the Third Council of Constantinople until “the
philosopher Theodore” should be able to take part in their deliberations.
Vitalian had the prosperity of the English mission scarcely
less at heart than St. Gregory, and discerned the full importance of
providing the infant Church with men who should be capable of
laying a solid foundation of sacred learning in her schools. With
this view he sent together with Theodore, the abbot Adrian, whom
William of Malmsbury calls “a fountain of letters, and a river of
arts.” At the same time Benedict Biscop received orders to join the
company of the new archbishop and to him was committed the
direction of the monastery and school of Canterbury. But Benedict
had one purpose fixed in his heart; it was to devote his life and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
extraordinary energies to the foundation of a great seat of learning
and religion in his own land, and to fit himself thoroughly for the
work before he began it. The weald of Kent might have richer
pastures, the sky of Italy a softer glow, but the brown moors of
Northumbria were ever present to his mind’s eye, and it was there
that he desired to spend and be spent for Christ. He was not long
before he found out that Adrian’s acquirements were far beyond his
own; so resigning the abbacy into his hands, from a master he
became a scholar, and spent two years more studying under him,
and acting as interpreter to him and to the archbishop. Theodore
had brought with him a large addition to the English library, and
among his books were a copy of Homer (which, in Archbishop
Parker’s days, was still preserved at Canterbury), the works of
Josephus, and the homilies of St. Chrysostom. Bede’s account of
the new life infused into the English schools by these two illustrious
foreigners is doubtless familiar to all readers. Yet it is too much
to the purpose to be omitted here. “Assisted by Adrian,” he says,
“the archbishop everywhere taught the right rule of life and the
canonical custom of celebrating Easter. And forasmuch as both of
them were well read in sacred and secular literature, they gathered
a crowd of disciples, and there daily flowed from them rivers of
knowledge to water the hearts of their hearers: and together with
the books of Holy Writ, they also taught the arts of ecclesiastical
poetry, astronomy, and arithmetic. So that there are still living to
this day some of their scholars who are as well versed in the Greek
and Latin tongues as in their own wherein they were born. Never
were there happier times since the English came to Britain, for
their kings being brave men and good Christians, were a terror
to barbarous nations, and the minds of all men were bent upon the
joys of the heavenly kingdom of which they had heard; and all who
desired to be instructed in sacred literature had masters at hand to
teach them.”</p>

<p>Adrian had many good pupils, among whom was Albinus, who
succeeded him in the government of his abbey, and greatly assisted
Bede in collecting the materials of his history, and who was besides
an excellent Greek scholar; and St. John of Beverley, whom Oxford
historians fondly believe to have been the first master of liberal arts
in their university. For, according to some authorities, the Oxford
schools grew out of those founded at Cricklade, which place is said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to have derived its original name of “Greeklade” from the good
Greek which was there taught by Adrian’s disciples. Another
student drawn to Canterbury by the fame of its classical learning was
St. Aldhelm, one of Maidulf’s early pupils, who very soon resolved
upon migrating from Malmsbury to the archiepiscopal seminary.
Ill-health did not permit him to remain there long, but a letter from
the young collegian is preserved, addressed to his own diocesan,
Hedda, Bishop of Wessex, which gives very ample information as to
the nature and extent of the studies on which he was engaged.
Some suspicion of exaggeration may naturally attach to such general
notices of the English learning as that given by Bede, but the more
minute account of Aldhelm is open to no such objection. “I confess,
most reverend father,” he says, “that I had resolved, if circumstances
had permitted, to have spent the approaching Christmas in
the company of my relations, and to have enjoyed for some time
the pleasure of your society. But as I find it impossible to do so
for various reasons, I hope you will excuse my not waiting on you as
I had intended. The truth is that there is a necessity for spending
a great deal of time in this seat of learning, specially if one be
inflamed with the love of study, and desirous, as I am, of becoming
acquainted with all the secrets of the Roman jurisprudence. And
I am engaged also on another study still more tedious and perplexing.”
Here he enters at some length on the subject of Latin versification,
and describes the various classical metres, all of which were
taught in Adrian’s school; and in the intricacies of which the Anglo-Saxon
scholars singularly delighted to exercise their ingenuity. He
then continues in a tone of less satisfaction; “but what shall I say
of arithmetic, the long and intricate calculations of which are sufficient
to overwhelm the mind, and cast it into despair? For my own
part all the labours of my former studies are trifling in comparison
with this. So that I may say with St. Jerome on a like occasion,
‘before I entered on that study I thought myself a master, but now
I find I was but a learner.’ However, by the blessing of God, and
assiduous reading, I have at length overcome the chief difficulties,
and have found out the method of calculating suppositions, which
are called the parts of a number. I believe it will be better to say
nothing of astronomy, the Zodiac and its twelve signs revolving in
the heavens, which require a long illustration, rather than to disgrace
that noble art by too short and imperfect an account, especially as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
there are some parts of it&mdash;as astrology and the perplexing calculation
of horoscopes&mdash;which require a master’s hand to do them justice.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that at the time when Aldhelm wrote,
every problem in arithmetic had to be worked by means of the seven
Roman letters C. D. I. L. M. V. and X., and the decimal system
was unknown. Very often the student was compelled to abandon
their use and <em>write</em> the numbers he was employed on in words.
And in default of more convenient numerals, recourse was had to
what might be called a duodecimal system, by which every number
was divided into twelve parts, the different combinations of which
were named and computed according to the divisions of the Roman
money. And lastly, there was the system of “indigitation,” <ins class="corr" id="tn69" title="Transcriber’s Note—“wherein the ten fingures” changed to “wherein the ten fingers”.">wherein the ten fingers</ins> were made to serve the purpose of a modern
arithmeticon.</p>

<p>St. Aldhelm elsewhere enumerates the studies pursued in the
school of Canterbury as consisting of grammar, that is the Latin and
Greek tongues, geometry, arithmetic, music, mechanics, astronomy,
and astrology: he himself is also said to have studied the Hebrew
Scriptures in their original text, and his works both in prose and
poetry bear witness to his familiarity with the chief Latin poets, such
as Virgil, Juvenal, Lucan, and Persius, whom he frequently quotes.
He was the first Englishman who appeared before the world in the
character of an author; his chief poems being a Treatise on the Eight
Virtues, and one in praise of Virginity. His Latin versification is of
the most artificial structure; in one of his poetical prefaces the initial
letters of each line read downwards, the terminal letters read upwards,
and the last line read backwards, all repeat the words of the first
line read straightforwards; and this he pleasantly denominates “a
square poem.” I will give but one couplet as a sample of the kind
of brain-puzzles which afforded such solace to the Anglo-Saxon
students. The reader will observe that the lines may be read
equally well backwards or forwards, still forming the same succession
of letters:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">All the writings of Aldhelm exhibit instances of the same misplaced
ingenuity, as well as that love of enigma which was general among his
countrymen. In spite of these faults, however, and of a certain pompous
and pedantic style which treats very ordinary subjects in very big
words, and is an anticipation by eleven centuries of the Johnsonian
dialect, it is impossible to deny that our first English author was a
man of genius and erudition. In his poems, which are redundant
with imagery, he gathers his similitudes now from the household
arts of the smith and the weaver, now from the natural beauties of
hill and field. You see that you are reading the thoughts of one
who does not owe everything to books, but who has observed and
reasoned for himself. Thus, desiring to show that perfection does
not consist in chastity alone, but in a combination of all the virtues
in their proper order, he compares it to “a web, not of one uniform
colour and texture, but woven with purple threads and many colours
into a variety of figures by the shuttles flying from side to side.”
Describing a well-stored memory, he compares it to the work of the
sagacious bees, “who, when the dewy dawn appears and the beams
of the limpid sun arise, pour the thick armies of their dancing swarms
over the open fields; and, now lying in the honied leaves of the
marigold or the purple tops of the heather, suck the nectar drop by
drop, and carry home their plunder on burdened thighs.” A copy
of his treatise on Virginity is preserved in the Lambeth library, in
which a highly finished illumination represents him seated in his
chair surrounded by a group of nuns. The book was in fact written
for the use of the Abbess Hildelitha and her religious daughters of
Wimbourne; for the Anglo-Saxon nuns very early vied with the
monks in their application to letters.</p>

<p>On leaving Canterbury Aldhelm returned to Malmsbury and soon
raised the reputation of the school. Pupils flocked to him even
from France and Scotland, for, says William of Malmsbury, “some
admired the sanctity of the man, and others the depth of his learning.
He was as simple in piety as he was multifarious in knowledge,
having imbibed the seven liberal arts so perfectly that he was wonderful
in each, and unrivalled in all.” One of his pupils was Ethilwald,
afterwards Bishop of Lindisfarne, to whom, as to his “most beloved
son and disciple,” he addressed a letter, preserved among his other
works. After warning him against the vain pleasures of the world,
“such as the custom of daily junketings, indulgence in immoderate
feasting, and continued riding and racing,” he admonishes him to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
on his guard against the love of money and silly parade, and exhorts
him rather to apply himself to the study of the Scriptures; and
inasmuch as the meaning of almost every part of them depends on
the rules of grammar, to perfect himself in that art, that so he may
dive into the signification of the text. Ethilwald was a devoted
admirer of the saint, and left some verses in praise of his illustrious
master whom he is too good a scholar to call by his barbarous Saxon
name, preferring to translate it into the more classic appellation of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassis prisca</i>, or <em>old helmet</em>. Another of Aldhelm’s pupils and correspondents
was Eadfrid, who, after the fashion of the times, passed
over into the sister isle to profit by the learning of the Irish schools.
He remained there six years, and was heartily congratulated by
Aldhelm on his return from what he calls the “land of fog.”
“Nowadays,” says the scholar of Malmsbury, “the renown of the
Irish is so great that one daily sees them going or returning; and
crowds flock to their island to gather up the liberal arts and physical
sciences. But if the sky of Ireland has its stars, has not that of
England its sun in Theodore the philosopher, and its mild moon
in Adrian, gifted with an inexpressible urbanity?”</p>

<p>In 675 Malmsbury became an abbey, and Aldhelm was chosen its
first abbot. When the diocese of Wessex was divided into two parts
he was named Bishop of Sherburne, whence the episcopal see was
afterwards removed to Salisbury. A well-known anecdote represents
him to us instructing the rude peasantry of Malmsbury who would
not stay to listen to the Sunday sermon, by singing his verses to them,
harp in hand, after the fashion of a wandering gleeman. We read
also of the pains he took in forming a library in his abbey, and how,
being on a visit to Bretwald, Archbishop of Canterbury (an old companion
and former schoolfellow), he heard of the arrival at Dover
of a foreign ship, and at once hastened down to the coast to see if
there were any <em>books</em> among its cargo. As he was walking on the
seashore intently examining the merchandise that was unlading, he
espied a heap of books, and among them a volume containing the
entire Bible. This was a treasure indeed, and a very rare one, for
the books of Scripture were generally written out separately, and had
to be procured and copied one by one. He determined at once to
secure the Bible for his library, and turning over the pages with a
knowing air, began to bargain with the owners and to beat them
down somewhat in the price. The sailors grumbled at this, and said
he might undervalue his own goods if he liked, but not those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
others. At last they turned him away with very abusive language,
and, refusing all his offers, pulled off with the Bible to their ship.
But a terrible tempest arose, which made them repent of their churlish
conduct, and returning to the shore they entreated the good bishop
to pardon their rudeness and accept the book as a gift, for it seems
they considered that they had only been saved from shipwreck by
his prayers. Aldhelm, however, laid down the half of their original
demand, and returned with his prize to his convent, where the book
was still preserved in the time of William of Malmsbury.</p>

<p>We must now return to St. Bennet Biscop, who, after completing
his studies at Canterbury, was planning a fourth expedition to Rome,
chiefly for the purpose of collecting books. His bibliographical tour
was crowned with complete success. He travelled along purchasing,
and also begging books in all directions, which when procured were
deposited in the keeping of trusty friends, from whom he gathered
them up again on his homeward journey. He returned to England
laden with his treasures, and obtained a grant of land from Egfrid,
king of Northumbria, for the erection of his long-contemplated
monastery. It was dedicated to St. Peter, and situated at the mouth
of the Wear&mdash;a spot, says William of Malmsbury, “which once glittered
with a multitude of towns built by the Romans,” and which in our
own days also is a busy scene of trade. Though the Roman towns
had disappeared in Biscop’s time, his monastery was far from standing
in the midst of a solitude. In fact, he sought, not shunned, the
haunts of men, for his main object was their instruction. He had
no intention of being merely “the man wise for himself;” his books
and his learning had been acquired to profit other souls besides his
own. So he did not choose a lonesome wilderness, or a marsh, or
a desert island, but a spot conveniently situated within reach of what,
even in the seventh century, was a tolerably busy port. “The broad
and ample river running into the sea,” says the old historian already
quoted, “received vessels borne by gentle gales on the calm bosom
of its haven;” and the parish of Monk-Wearmouth in the now smoky
town of Sunderland marks the ground occupied by St. Bennet’s first
foundation.</p>

<p>It was commenced in the year 674, the monastery being at first
only built of wood, but the church was planned on a more magnificent
scale. Bennet, who thought nothing of a long journey in pursuit of
his cherished designs, crossed over to France to seek out good
masons, and brought them back with him to Wearmouth, where they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
built him a very handsome church of hewn stone. The fame of this
noble structure spread far and wide, and Naitan, king of the Picts,
sent ambassadors imploring that the French masons might be sent
to build an exactly similar church in his dominions. As soon as the
walls of his church were up, Bennet sent over once more to France
for glass-makers, who glazed all the windows both of the church and
monastery. Bede tells us that these were the first artificers in glass
who had been seen in England. “It is an art,” he says, “not to be
despised, because of its use in furnishing lamps for the cloisters and
other kinds of vessels.” The church being now finished and furnished,
the books were stored up in the library, and four years were spent
by the abbot in collecting the spiritual stones of his edifice. The
result of his labours was so satisfactory that King Egfrid desired to
see another monastery of similar character founded in his kingdom,
and in 682 the saint obtained a second grant of land at Jarrow-on-the-Tyne,
about five miles from Wearmouth. “The spot has no
claim to beauty,” says a modern writer, “yet it is calculated to produce
an impression of solemn quiet. The church and crumbling walls of
the old monastery standing on a green hill sloping to the bay, the
long silvery expanse of water, the gentle ripple of the advancing tide,
the sea-birds perpetually hovering on the wing or dipping in the
wave, and the distant view of Shields harbour with its clouds of
smoke and forests of masts, form no ordinary combination.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And
we may add that no ordinary feelings stir in the heart of the visitor
who sees in those grey crumbling walls, with their vestiges of Norman
and Saxon ornament, the remains of that monastic seminary which
nurtured the genius and the sanctity of the Venerable Bede. Here
arose the monastery of St. Paul’s; and if you look in the eastern
wall of the church you may still see the inscription, of unquestioned
antiquity, which preserves the memory of its dedication. It is cut
on a small tablet in good Roman letters, and tells you that the church
was dedicated on the eighth of the kalends of May, in the fifteenth
year of Egfrid the king, and during the abbacy of Ceolfrid.</p>

<p>This Ceolfrid deserves a few words to himself. He was originally
a monk of Ripon, where he became master of the school and the
novices. His pupils, who were mostly high-born youths, showed
some disdain for those menial employments that formed part of a
monk’s daily life, and which they associated with the idea of servitude;
but Ceolfrid, himself an earl’s son, overcame their repugnance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
by his own example. He undertook the care of the bakehouse, and
might daily be seen cleaning the oven, bolting the meal, and baking
the bread for the use of the brethren. From labours such as these
he passed to the school, and there made his scholars understand that
a man may make a very good baker without losing his taste for the
liberal arts. Ceolfrid’s fame at last reached the ears of St. Bennet,
who, it must be owned, was covetous of learned monks and good
books. So he begged him of the abbot of Ripon, and, having
obtained him, placed the new monastery of Jarrow under his government.
The two houses, however, continued to be so closely united
as to form but one community; they were like one monastery, says
Bede, built in two places. Ceolfrid held the abbacy of St. Paul’s for
seven years, during which time the dreadful pestilence of 686 broke
out, which swept away all the choir monks, with the exception of the
abbot himself and one little boy, with whose aid he still contrived to
chant the canonical hours, though their voices were often enough
choked with their tears. This little boy could be no other than St.
Bede himself, who had accompanied the monks from Wearmouth to
Jarrow, and was then seven years of age.</p>

<p>St. Bennet’s journeys were not yet over. As soon as the foundation
of Jarrow was completed he set out on a fifth expedition to
Rome accompanied by Ceolfrid, and this time brought back, not only
books and relics, but also pictures. These last he placed in his two
churches: at the west end of the Church of St. Peter he placed
pictures of our Lady and the twelve Apostles; on the south wall
were scenes from the Gospels, and on the north the visions of the
Apocalypse. The pictures placed in St. Paul’s were intended to show
the connection between the Old and New Testaments. There you
saw representations of Isaac bearing the wood of the sacrifice, and
of our Lord bearing His Cross: of the brazen serpent, and the Crucifixion.
“Those, therefore, who knew not how to read,” says Bede,
“entering these churches, found on all sides agreeable and instructive
objects, representing Christ and His saints, and recalling to their
memory the grace of His Incarnation and the terrors of the last judgment.”
But Bennet had brought from Rome something even more
precious than his pictures. It was not to be supposed that in his
solicitude to provide his monks with the best instruction that books
or teachers could afford he should overlook the necessity of providing
them with masters of the ecclesiastical chant. The Roman chant
had already been introduced into Northumbria by James the Deacon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the fellow-labourer of St. Paulinus, who, says Bede, was extraordinarily
skilful in singing, and taught the same to many, after the custom of the
Romans. But he was now an old man, and does not seem to have
formed any disciples qualified to succeed him in his office. Benedict
therefore entreated Pope Agatho to allow him to take back into
England no less a personage than John the Venerable, abbot of St.
Martin’s, and arch-chanter of St. Peter’s, that he might teach in his
monastery the method of singing throughout the year as it was
practised in St. Peter’s Church. It argues much the importance
which was attached at Rome to Benedict’s foundations, that his
petition was granted. Abbot John received orders to set out for the
barbarous north, and, taking up his residence at Wearmouth, he
taught the chanters of that monastery the whole order and manner
of singing and reading aloud, and committed to writing all that
was requisite throughout the whole course of the year for the celebration
of festivals; “all which rules,” adds St. Bede, “are still observed
there, and have been copied by many other monasteries. And the said
John not only taught the brethren of that monastery, but such as had
skill in singing resorted from almost all the monasteries of the same province
to hear him, and many invited him to teach in other places.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, was the provision made by St. Bennet for the instruction
of his monks and the establishment among them of a school
of sacred learning. And his enterprise was a grand success. His
twin houses became centres of human and divine science, as well as
of regular discipline. The life led within their walls has been made
familiar to us by the pen of Bede, who, with that simplicity which
forms the charm of his writing, describes it in all its homely features.
The men who were engaged in rearing, on the barbarous shores of
England, a seminary of learning which had not its equal north of
the Alps, might every day be seen taking part in the duties of the
farmyard and the kitchen. Abbot Easterwine, a former courtier of
King Egfrid’s, who was chosen to fill the place of abbot during the
absence of St. Bennet, delighted in winnowing the corn, giving milk
to the young calves, working at the mill or forge, and helping in the
bakehouse. It is thus that Bede describes him; but he dwells also
on the spiritual beauty of the abbot’s “transparent countenance,” his
musical voice and gentle temper, and tells us how, being seized with
his last illness, “coming out into the open air, and sitting down, he
called for his weeping brethren, and, after the manner of his tender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
nature, gave them all the kiss of peace, and died at night as they
were singing lauds.”</p>

<p>As St. Bennet was still absent, the monks chose in his room the
deacon Sigfrid, who continued to share the government with Bennet
after his return. Both of them were afflicted with grievous infirmity
during the three last years of their lives, St. Bennet being almost
entirely paralysed, while Sigfrid was wasted with a slow consumption.
The last hours of the saint were in harmony with his life. His monks
read the Scriptures aloud to him during his sleepless nights, and
he often charged them to remember the two things that he most
earnestly recommended to his children, the preservation of regular
discipline, and the care of his books. When unable to leave his
bed, and too weak to recite the Divine Office, he caused some of
the brethren to recite it in his chamber, divided into two choirs, and
joined with them as well as he could. The two venerable abbots,
who were both hourly expecting death, had a great wish to meet
once more in this life, and to satisfy their desire, the monks carried
Sigfrid on a litter to St. Bennet’s cell, and laid them side by side,
their heads resting on the same pillow, that they might give each
other a farewell kiss; but so extreme was their weakness, that even
this they were not able to do without assistance. After their departure
Ceolfrid continued to govern both houses for twenty-eight
years, during which time he did much to advance the studies of
the brethren, and sent several of them to Rome to complete their
education. He increased the library, and caused three copies of the
entire Bible to be written out, one of which he sent as a present to
the Pope, whilst the other two were placed in the two churches, “to
the end that all who wished to read any passage in either Testament
might at once find what they wanted.” Naitan, king of the Picts,
applied to him for church ornaments, as he had applied to St.
Bennet for masons. The abbot’s reply may be quoted as giving
some notion of his scholarship. “A certain worldly ruler,” he wrote,
“most truly said that the world would be happy if either philosophers
were kings, or kings philosophers. Now if a worldly man
could judge thus truly of the philosophy of this world, how much
more were it to be desired that the more powerful men are in this
world the more they would labour to be acquainted with the commandments
of God.” In this passage the Anglo-Saxon monk is
quoting from the Republic of Plato.</p>

<p>St. Bede, who has preserved these records of the Fathers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Wearmouth and Jarrow, dwells with delight on the memory of the
many happy years he himself passed within those walls, and on the
thought that none of them had been spent in idleness. “All my
life,” he says, “I have spent in this monastery, giving my whole
attention to the study of the Holy Scriptures; and in the intervals
between the hours of regular discipline, and the duties of church
psalmody, I ever took delight in either learning, teaching, or writing.”
It was his love of study that made him decline the office of
abbot, “for that office demands thoughtfulness, and thoughtfulness
brings distraction of mind, which is an impediment to learning.”
Though invited to Rome by Pope Sergius, it appears certain that he
never left his own country, and that all he knew was derived from
native teachers, principally, as he tells us, from the abbots Bennet
and Ceolfrid. The science of music, indeed, in which he excelled,
and on which he wrote several treatises, he had studied under John
of St. Martin’s; Trumhere, a monk of Lestingham, was his master
in divinity, and his Greek scholarship was probably acquired from
Archbishop Theodore himself. But the varied character of Bede’s
erudition must be principally explained by his free use of Biscop’s noble
libraries. It was at the command of his abbot, and of St. John of
Beverley, who ordained him priest, that he began, at thirty years of
age, to write for the instruction of his countrymen. For his greater
convenience a little building was erected apart from the monastery,
which Simeon of Durham speaks of as yet standing in the twelfth
century, “where, free from all distraction, he could sit, meditate,
read, write, or dictate.” The original building must have been swept
away at the time of the destruction of the monastery by the Danes
in 794, yet Leland describes what he calls St. Bede’s oratory, as
remaining, even in his time.</p>

<p>His studies, however, were not suffered to interfere with his other
duties, for he was most exact in the minute observance of his rule,
and specially in the discharge of the choral office, though, as he owns
in a letter to Bishop Acca, these necessary demands on his time, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monasticæ servitutis retinacula</i>, as he calls them, proved no small
hindrance to his work. Yet he never sought exemption of any kind,
and least of all from attendance in choir. “If the angels did not
find me there among my brethren,” he would say, “would they not
say, Where is Bede? why comes he not to worship at the appointed
time with the others?”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It was thus he found the secret of keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
alive the spirit of fervour in the midst of continued labour of
the head. Printed among his theological and philosophical works,
is a little manual, drawn up, as it would seem, for his own private
use, and consisting of a selection of favourite verses from the
Psalms. His disciple, Cuthbert, says of him. “I can declare with
truth, that never saw I with my eyes, or heard I with my ears, of any
man so indefatigable in giving thanks to God.” Besides the requirements
of his monastic rule, and his own private studies, Bede had
other duties which engaged a large portion of his time. He was
both mass priest and scholasticus. In the first capacity, he had to
administer the sacraments, visit the sick, and preach on Sundays
and festivals; in the second, to communicate to others the learning
he had himself acquired. Even before his ordination, the direction
of the monastic school was placed in his hands, and here he taught
sacred and humane letters to the 600 monks of Jarrow, as well as
to the pupils who flocked to him from all parts of England. The
character of his teaching is beautifully noticed in the breviary lessons
for his feast. “He was easily kindled and moved to compunction
by study, and whether reading or teaching, often wept abundantly.
And after study he always applied himself to prayer, well knowing
that the knowledge of the Sacred Scriptures is to be gained rather
by the grace of God than by our own efforts. He had many
scholars, all of whom he inspired with extraordinary love of learning;
and what is more, he infused into them the holy virtue of
religion; he was most affable to the good, but terrible to the proud
and negligent; sweet in countenance, with a musical voice, and an
aspect at once cheerful and grave.”</p>

<p>The writings of Bede bear witness to the extent of his learning.
He himself gives a list of forty-five works of which he was the author,
including, besides his homilies and commentaries on Holy Scripture,
treatises on grammar, astronomy, the logic of Aristotle, music, geography,
arithmetic, orthography, versification, the computum, and
natural philosophy. His Ecclesiastical History and Lives of the
Fathers must always be admired as models of unaffected simplicity
of style. He was well skilled in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew
tongues.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> His Greek erudition is proved by the fact of his having
translated the life of St. Athanasius out of Greek into Latin, and also
by the Retractations, which, with characteristic candour, he published
in his old age, to correct some errors into which he had fallen in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
earlier commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles, and which he became
aware of after meeting with a Greek manuscript of that portion
of the Scriptures which varied from the Latin text. His treatises on
grammar and versification betray an acquaintance with Latin literature
which shows us that St. Bennet’s libraries must have been well
stored with classics.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In his scientific views, he of course followed
the generally received theories of the time in which he lived; though
in some points he corrected the errors of former writers by the result
of his own observations. “Bede’s works,” observes Mr. Turner, “are
evidence that the establishment of the Teutonic nations on the ruins
of the Roman Empire did not <em>barbarise</em> knowledge. He collected
and taught more natural truths than any Roman writer had yet
accomplished; and his works display an advance, not a retrogression,
in science.” Thus, he taught that the stars derived their light from
the sun; that the true shape of the earth was globular,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> to which he
attributes the irregularity of our days and nights. He explains the
ebb and flow of the tide, by the attractive power of the moon, and
points out the error of supposing that all the waters of the ocean rise
at the same moment, instancing observations which he has taken
himself on different parts of the English coast in support of his statement.
He shows that the sun is eclipsed by the intervention of the
moon, and the moon by that of the earth. He also gives simple and
intelligent explanations of various natural phenomena, such as the
rainbow, and the formation of rain and hail. He had the good sense
to condemn judicial astrology as equally false and pernicious, and
applied his scientific knowledge to useful purposes, constructing tables
to serve the place of a modern ephemeris.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of his writings, however, consist of commentaries
on the Holy Scriptures, in which his design is less to indulge
in original speculation, than to resume the teaching of the
Fathers. After the fashion of the early writers, he reproduces their
metaphysical arguments, and even their words and imagery, his love
of science occasionally appearing in his selections. Thus, in speaking
of the Holy Trinity, he embodies in his text the beautiful illustration
repeated before him by St. John Chrysostom, and other early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Fathers, wherein the Three Divine Persons in one essence are compared
to the form, the light, and the heat of the sun. The globular
body of the sun, he says, never leaves the heavens, but its light
(which he compares to the person of the Son), and its heat (to that
of the Holy Ghost) descend to earth and diffuse themselves everywhere,
animating the mind and kindling the heart. Yet though universally
present, light never really quits the sun, for we behold it
there; and heat, too, is never separated from it; and the whole is
one sun, comprised within a circle, which has no end and no beginning.
He shows the same analogies in other forms of nature, as in
water, wherein we see the fountain, the flowing river, and the lake&mdash;all
different in form, yet one in substance, and inseparable one from
the other. In his treatise, <cite>De Natura Rerum</cite>, he not only exhibits
vast erudition but often expresses himself with a certain unadorned
eloquence. “Observe,” he says, “how all things are made to suit and
to govern one another. See how heaven and earth are respectively
adorned; heaven, by the sun, moon, and stars, and earth by its
beautiful flowers, its herbs, trees, and fruits. From these men derive
their food, their shining jewels, the various pictures so pleasantly
woven in their hangings, their variegated colours, the sweet melody
of strings and organs, the splendour of gold and silver, and the
pleasant streams of water which bring us ships and set in motion our
mills, together with the fragrant aroma of myrrh, and the sweet form
of the human countenance.” Bede’s love of music reveals itself in a
thousand passages. “Among all the sciences,” he says, “this one is
most commendable, pleasing, mirthful, and lovely. It makes a man
liberal, cheerful, courteous, and amiable. It rouses him to battle,
enables him to bear fatigue, comforts him under labour, refreshes the
disturbed mind, takes away headaches, and soothes the desponding
heart.”</p>

<p>There is one subject which engaged his attention that deserves a
more particular notice, I mean the labours he directed to the grammatical
formation of his native language, a work of vast importance,
which, in every country where the barbarous races had established
themselves, had to be undertaken by the monastic scholars. Rohrbacher
observes that St. Bede did much by his treatises on grammar
and orthography, to impress a character of regularity on the modern
languages which, in the eighth and ninth centuries, were beginning
to be formed out of the Latin and Germanic dialects. Much more
was his influence felt on the Anglo-Saxon dialect, in which he both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
preached and wrote. A curious poetical fragment of the twelfth
century, discovered some years since in Worcester Cathedral, names
him among other saints “who taught our people in English,” and
praises him in particular, for having “wisely translated” for the instruction
of his flock. This is not mere tradition. Besides commenting
on nearly the whole Bible, Bede is known to have translated
into English both the Psalter and the four Gospels. But this involved
a labour the character and amount of which is not easily
appreciated, unless we bear in mind what the state of the vernacular
tongue was at that time. Before their conversion to Christianity the
Anglo-Saxons possessed no literature, that is to say, no <em>written</em> compositions
of any kind, and their language had not therefore assumed
a regular grammatical form. In this they resembled most of the
other barbarous nations, of whom St. Irenæus observes,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> that they
held the faith by tradition, “without the help of pen and ink;” meaning,
as he himself explains, that for want of letters they could have
no use of the Scriptures. The Anglo-Saxons were indeed acquainted
with the Runic letters; but there is every reason to believe that these
were exclusively used for monumental inscriptions or magic spells.
The Runic letters were indeed so closely associated in the mind of
the people with magical practices that the Christian missionaries
found it necessary to avoid their use,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and introduced the letters
commonly called Anglo-Saxon, which are, however, nothing more
than corruptions of the Roman alphabet. Although the Saxons had
no written literature, they had, however, a body of native poetry consisting
of songs and fragmentary narratives which, like the poems of
Homer or Ossian, were preserved solely in the memory of the bards,
who occasionally made additions or enlargements of the story, as
their genius prompted. Together with the change of religion
appeared a change in the character of the popular minstrelsy. Tales
from the Scriptures took the place of legends of pagan heroes, and
the Christian missionaries made use of these for the purpose of instilling
into their rude hearers some knowledge of the mysteries of
faith.</p>

<p>But the Saxon poetry, even in its Christianised form, does not
appear to have been <em>written down</em> until the time of Alfred. Before
any steps could be taken to form a literature, the language itself had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to be laboriously reduced to grammatical rules. The Anglo-Saxon
language, as it exists in the literature of a later period, is of extremely
complex construction, far richer in grammatical inflexion than our
modern English. But in its barbarous state, as we read it in the
early fragments of the bardic poems, it was a barren combination of
verbs, nouns, and pronouns, and nouns freely used in an adjective
and verbal sense, and entirely destitute of all the smaller particles.
The change it underwent during the two centuries that preceded the
time of Alfred was the transformation of a barbarous dialect into a
finished grammatical language, and this change was mainly effected
by the labours of the monks. Nor is it mere matter of conjecture
that Bede had a considerable share in this great work. He was
probably the first who applied himself to it, and has himself let us
know the reasons which induced him to undertake the translation of
certain familiar forms of prayer into the native dialect. In 734,
Archbishop Egbert, who then presided over the school of York,
having invited him thither, Bede accepted the invitation, as he says,
“for the sake of reading,” the York library offering temptations not
to be resisted. He stayed there some months, teaching in the archbishop’s
school; and would have repeated his visit in the following
year had not his declining health rendered this impossible. To
excuse the failure of his promise, he addressed a long and interesting
letter to Egbert, in which, among other things, he suggests the
appointment of priests to the rural districts, who should be diligent
in instructing the peasantry, and who should teach them the Creed
and the Our Father in their own tongue, “which,” he adds, “I have
myself translated into English for the benefit of those priests who are
not familiar with the vernacular.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But the translation of these prayers
was a very small part of his labours; he had, as we have already
said, made an Anglo-Saxon version of the Psalter and the Gospels,
and on this latter work he was engaged up to the day of his death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
This we learn from the beautiful letter written by his pupil Cuthbert
to a fellow reader and schoolfellow Cuthwin, which, often as it has
been quoted, we cannot here omit. After speaking of the way in
which his beloved master had spent the whole of his life, cheerful
and joyful, and giving thanks to God day and night; and how he
daily read lessons to his disciples even to within a fortnight of his
death, he relates how the saint admonished them to prepare for death,
“and being learned in our poetry,” quoted some things in the English
tongue; how, according to his custom, he often sung antiphons,
specially that belonging to the season of the Ascension which then
drew nigh, beginning “O Rex gloriæ.” “And when he came to those
words ‘leave us not orphans,’ he burst into tears and wept much,
and we also wept with him. By turns we read, and by turns we
wept; nay, we wept continually while we read.” ... During
this time he laboured to compose two works well worthy to be
remembered, besides the lessons that we had of him, and the singing
of the Psalms; namely, he translated the Gospel of St. John, as far
as the words “But what are these among so many?” into our own
tongue for the benefit of the Church, and some collections out of St.
Isidore’s works; for he said, I will not have my scholars read falsehoods
after my death, or labour in that book without profit....
When the Tuesday before the Ascension of our Lord came, he passed
all that day dictating cheerfully, for, he said, I know not how long I
shall last, or what time my Maker will take me. And yet to us he
seemed to know very well the time of his departure. And so he
spent the night; and when the morning appeared, that is, Wednesday,
he ordered us to write with all speed what he had begun, and this
done, we walked till the third hour with the relics of saints, according
to the custom of that day. There was one of us with him who
said to him, “Dear Master, there is still one chapter wanting, will it
fatigue you to be asked any more questions?” He answered, “It is
no trouble. Take your pen and mend it, and write quickly.” He
then took farewell of them all, and so continued cheerfully to speak
till about sunset, when the youth before mentioned said again,
“Beloved master, there is still one sentence unwritten.” “Then write
it quickly,” he replied. In a few moments the youth said, “Now it
is finished.” “You have spoken true,” said the dying saint. “It is
finished. Now, therefore, take my head into your hands, for it is a
great delight to sit opposite to that holy place where I have been
wont to pray, and there let me sit once more, and call upon my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Father.” So sitting thus on the floor of his cell, and repeating the
ejaculation “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
Ghost,” he breathed his last, on May 26, 735.</p>

<p>The school of York was rising into celebrity just as Bede was
withdrawn from the scene of his useful labours. Egbert, who may
be considered as its founder, was himself a pupil of Bishop Eata’s,
but had completed his studies in Rome. He was brother to the
reigning King of Northumbria, and succeeded to the see of York at
a time when the affairs of the diocese had fallen into some disorder.
One of his great works was the collection of a body of canons, and
the publication of his famous Penitential, which furnished the Anglo-Saxon
Church with fixed laws of discipline, gathered from the early
fathers and canonists. While thus engaged, however, the archbishop
applied himself with no less fervour to the encouragement of learning.
He committed the mastership of the school he founded to his
relation Albert, but himself continued to overlook the studies, and
charged himself with the explanation of the Scriptures of the New
Testament, leaving to Albert the other departments of literature.
Under their united care the fame of the York seminary soon extended
beyond the shores of Britain, and it is said to have embraced a larger
course of instruction than was to be found at the same period in
any school either of Gaul or Spain. Alcuin, a pupil of the academy
over which he afterwards presided, enumerates among the studies
there pursued, the seven liberal arts, as well as chronology, natural
history, jurisprudence, and mathematics. Attached to the school
was a library, which, under the munificent care of Egbert, became
rich in all the works both of Christian and heathen antiquity. Alcuin,
who filled the office of librarian, has given a list of its contents; he
enumerates the works of SS. Jerome, Hilary, Ambrose, Augustine,
Athanasius, Gregory the Great, Leo, Basil, Fulgentius and Chrysostom;
of Orosius, Boethius, Pliny, Aristotle, and Cicero; of the poets
Virgil and Lucan, of Prosper, Lactantius, and many others, together
with the writings of Bede and Aldhelm, the two English writers who
had already acquired a literary fame. These books were chiefly
collected by Albert, whose custom it was to pass over to the Continent
on book-hunting expeditions, in which he was generally accompanied
by Alcuin.</p>

<p>The librarian of York afterwards composed a poem on the subject
of the saints and archbishops of that city, in which he celebrates the
virtues of the two illustrious prelates under whom he studied, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the treasures of science stored up by their praiseworthy care. Egbert,
as he tells us, presided personally over the studies of the younger
clergy, for this was then reckoned one of the chief duties of a bishop.
As soon as he was at leisure in the morning he sent for some of his
young clerks, and, sitting on his couch, taught them in succession
till about noon, when he said mass in his private chapel. After a
frugal dinner he had them with him again, and entertained himself
by hearing them discuss literary questions in his presence. Towards
evening he recited Compline with them, and then, calling them to
him one by one, gave his blessing to each as they knelt at his feet.</p>

<p>In the collection of canons already mentioned Egbert provided
for the religious instruction of the poor as well as the rich. The
teaching of the common people is one of the duties specially
enjoined on the clergy, every priest being required to “instil
with great exactness into the people committed to his charge the
Creed and the Lord’s Prayer, as well as the whole doctrine and
practice of Christianity.” In the absence of books this was done
orally, much use being made of instructions cast into a metrical
form, and so committed to memory. Thus the multitude, if ignorant
of letters, were certainly not uninstructed, as we see in the case of
St. Cædmon whom Bede calls <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illiteratus</i>, that is, unable to read; but
who was nevertheless perfectly familiar with sacred history, which
he had learnt by oral instruction, and was thus able to sing of
the creation, the Deluge, the journeys of the Israelites, and the last
judgment.</p>

<p>Albert, the master of the school, and the successor of Egbert in
the see of York, is described by Alcuin in one of his poems as “a
pattern of goodness, justice, and piety, teaching the Catholic faith
in the spirit of love, stern to the stubborn, but pitiful and gentle to
the good.” If he marked any youths among his pupils who showed
peculiar signs of promise, like a good master, he made them his
friends. “He observed the natural dispositions of each with wonderful
skill, and, drawing them to him, taught and lovingly cherished
them. Some he dexterously imbued with the grammatical art, whilst
into the minds of others he instilled the sweetness of rhetoric. These
he endeavoured to polish with the juridical grindstone, those he
taught to cultivate the songs of the muses, and to tread the hill of
Parnassus with lyric steps. To others, again, he made known the
harmony of the heavens, the motions of the sun and moon, the five
zones, the seven wandering stars; the laws of the heavenly bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
their rising and setting; the aerial movements of the sea, and the
quaking of the earth; the nature of man, cattle, birds, and wild
beasts; the diversities of numbers and varieties of figures.” He
taught also how to calculate the return of the Paschal solemnity,
and above all expounded the mysteries of the Sacred Scriptures.
He often travelled into Gaul and Italy in quest of books and new
methods of instruction. The noblest families of Northumbria placed
their sons under his care, not only those who were training for the
ecclesiastical state, but those intended for the world. Indeed it is
certain that the pupils of the episcopal and monastic schools were
by no means exclusively ecclesiastics. Eddi tells us that St. Wilfrid
received many youths to educate, who on reaching man’s estate, if
they chose to embrace a secular life, were presented <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in armour</i> to
the king. Alfred, the son of king Egfrid of Northumbria, was himself
a pupil of St. Wilfrid, and spent some years in Ireland that he
might pursue his studies with greater advantage. He became a great
patron of learning, and corresponded with St. Aldhelm on philosophical
subjects and the difficulties of Latin prosody; and it was
to his son Ceolwulf that St. Bede addressed the dedication of his
Ecclesiastical History.</p>

<p>On the death of Egbert in 766 the unanimous voice of the people
called Albert to the vacant see. He showed himself worthy of their
choice, “feeding his flock with the food of the Divine Word, and
guarding the lambs of Christ from the wolf.” He governed the
Church of York for thirteen years, during which time he never
abandoned his care of the school. The mastership, however,
devolved on Alcuin, and such was the fame of his scholarship as to
draw students not only from all parts of England and Ireland, but
also from France and Germany. Among the latter was St. Luidger,
a native of Friesland, afterwards known as the Apostle of Saxony, of
whom we shall have more to say in the following chapter.</p>

<p>The extent and character of Alcuin’s learning will be more properly
studied when we come to speak of his labours at the court of Charlemagne;
it will be sufficient here to notice the fact that he was a
scholar of exclusively English growth, and drew all the materials
with which he worked in his after career from the library and the
schools of York. In his writings he often alludes to the want he
feels of “those invaluable books of scholastic erudition” which were
there placed at his command, through the affectionate industry of
his master, Albert, who continued, after his elevation to the episcopate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to add to the treasures already collected. Two years before
his death Albert resolved on resigning his pastoral charge that he
might spend his last days as a simple monk, and devote himself
exclusively to the affairs of his salvation. Calling to him, therefore,
his two favourite pupils, Eanbald and Alcuin, he committed to the
first the care of his diocese, and to the other that of his books, “the
dearest of all his treasures.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Alcuin was despatched to Rome to
obtain the sanction of the Holy See for the appointment of Eanbald
and it was at Parma on his homeward journey that the solicitations
of Charlemagne won his promise to settle at the court of that monarch,
and transfer to a foreign soil the learning he had acquired on the
shores of Saxon England.</p>

<p>With the death of Albert the prosperity of the Early English
schools may be said to have closed. Five years later the Danish
keels appeared for the first time off the Northumbrian coast: it
seemed only a passing alarm, but in 793 another armament effected
a landing at Lindisfarne, and after slaughtering the monks, gave to
the flames the most venerable of the English sanctuaries. This was
but the beginning of sorrows. The following year the twin monasteries
of Wearmouth and Jarrow shared a similar fate, and all the
treasures of art and literature collected by St. Biscop were ruthlessly
destroyed. For seventy years these scenes of carnage and plunder
went on without interruption in every part of England, and the riches
laid up in the churches everywhere pointed them out as the first
objects of attack. The finishing-blow came in 867, when “a great
heathen army,” as they are called by the Saxon chronicler, having
wintered in East Anglia, and there supplied themselves with horses,
marched northwards and made themselves masters of the city of
York. Thence they overran the kingdom of Northumbria, carrying
fire and sword wherever they appeared, till the whole country between
the Ouse and the Tyne presented only the smoking ruins of what
had once been cities and abbeys. Beverley, Ripon, Whitby, and
Lastingham, all seats of learning and civilisation, were swept away,
and in 875 the sea-king Halden crossed the Tyne and destroyed
the last remains of the monastic institute in Northumbria. After
burning Jarrow for the second time, he directed his course to Lindisfarne,
where the episcopal see was still fixed, and where a new
monastery had sprung up on the ruins of that formerly destroyed by
the Danes. Eardulf was then bishop, and on learning the approach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of the pagans he determined to save the holy relics of St. Cuthbert
by a timely flight. Calling his monks around him, therefore, he
communicated to them his resolve, and having disinterred the body
of the saint, together with those of St. Oswald and St. Aidan, they
prepared to bid farewell to the holy island, whence the light of
Christianity had shone forth over all the north of England for two
hundred and forty years. This closing scene in the history of
northern monasticism exhibits to us the monks of Lindisfarne in the
hour of their sorest trial, surrounded by their school. There were
in the monastery, says Simeon of Durham, a certain number of
youths, brought up there from their infancy, who had been taught
by the monks and trained in the singing of the Divine Office.
These boys entreated Eardulf to suffer them to follow him. They
set out, therefore, monks and children together, carrying the bier
with the holy relics, their sacred vessels, the Holy Book of the
Gospels, and their other books, and commenced that melancholy
journey which, after seven years of wandering, was to bring them at
last to the “grassy plain, on every side thickly wooded, but not
easy to be made habitable,” where afterwards grew up, on the site of
their wattled oratory, the princely city of Durham.</p>

<p>By these and similar calamities, extending not over one district,
but over every part of the country, England was plunged back into
the barbarism out of which she was but just emerging: her seats of
learning were all swept away, and during the century that elapsed
from the first landing of the Danes to the accession of Alfred, a
night of gloomy darkness settled over the land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prominent importance attaching to the schools of Kent and
Northumbria must not lead us to regard them as the only learned
foundations existing in England during the early period of which we
have hitherto been speaking. The spread of the monastic institute
among the Anglo-Saxons was so rapid and so universal, that we are
sometimes led to wonder how a country so thinly populated as
England must have been in the seventh century, could have furnished
those crowds of religious men and women who hastened to
people her newly-erected cloisters. And wherever those cloisters
were reared a knowledge of letters and the civilised arts was soon
introduced, and pursued with as much ardour at Selsey as at Lindisfarne,
among the nuns of St. Mildred or St. Hildelitha as among
the brethren of Jarrow.</p>

<p>If the bold and mountainous scenery of Northumbria has become
indelibly associated in our mind with the lives of those saintly
scholars who have been made known to us by the pen of Bede, far
away at the other extremity of England there is a province which still
claims as its patron saint one whose learning was as great as theirs,
and whose action on the Church was even yet more important. St
Boniface, or Winfrid, as he was called before he entered on his
apostolic labours, was born in the same year that witnessed the
entrance of Bede into the monastery of Jarrow. They were therefore
contemporaries, though widely different in character, as in the
career which awaited them. The simple-hearted scholar whose
holy happy life flowed calmly on from childhood to old age within
his convent walls, like some quiet stream that never overpasses its
verdant banks, is a contrast indeed to the great apostle who, after
having evangelised half Europe, and ruled the churches of France<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and Germany, as Vicar of the Vicar of Christ, with a spiritual sway
larger than any ever exercised save by the successors of St. Peter,
died, as was fitting, a martyr’s death, saluting with his parting
words the joy and glory of that “long-expected day.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Yet both in
different ways exhibit to us the noblest features of the Anglo-Saxon
race, whose simple piety and strong good sense are as apparent in
Bede, as the ardour of its active charity is in Boniface.</p>

its pathless valleys, and, fearless of the billows that lost their fierceness

passed over the barren hills of “Cornwall, void of flowery turf.” It
formed the border-land of English Saxony, and touched on that
unfriendly territory still inhabited by the Britons, who saw in the
newly converted Saxons only a race of giants and savages, with whom
they refused to hold any intercourse.</p>

<p>The Dumnonians, however, from the first era of their conversion,
showed the same readiness to welcome the establishment among
them of monks and schools as was elsewhere exhibited, and the city
of Exeter is said to have received the name of Monkton from the
number of religious which it contained. It was probably some of
the Exeter monks who, in the course of a journey which they had
undertaken for the purpose of preaching to the inhabitants of the
wild Western districts, were hospitably received and entertained at
Crediton by the father of Winfrid. The passing visit left an indelible
impression on the boy’s heart, and he grew up with the fixed desire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of becoming a monk and a scholar. His father did what he could
to turn him from his purpose, but finding himself forced at last
to yield to his son’s entreaties, he committed him to the care of
Wulphard, abbot of Exeter. Winfrid was at that time thirteen years
of age. His education had not been neglected in his father’s house,
and he now threw himself into his studies with an ardour which
made it evident that he deserved some higher kind of teaching than
the monks of Exeter could supply. The school of Nutscell, in
Hampshire, a monastery afterwards destroyed by the Danes, possessed
as high a reputation as any in Wessex, so thither Winfrid was
transferred, and placed under the direction of the learned abbot
Winbert. In this monastery Winfrid was able to satisfy his thirst
for grammar, poetry, and the sacred sciences, and at last, being
appointed to the care of the school, he drew students to hear him
from all the southern provinces. In short, the scholasticus of
Nutscell became a famous man; he taught not only the monks but
even the nuns of that part of the world to study grammar and write
hexameter verse; he attended royal councils and episcopal synods,
and he even appeared in the character of an author, and composed
a treatise on the Eight Parts of Speech. “Yet, though indued with
such excellent knowledge,” says his biographer, “he was nothing
puffed up in mind, nor did he despise any who were of meaner
abilities, but the more his learning increased so much also did he
increase in virtue, only showing himself the more humble, devout,
pitiful and obedient.” Both King Ina, of Wessex, and Archbishop
Bretwald, of Canterbury, knew his worth, and desired nothing better
than to raise him to the highest dignities; but neither the charms of
a studious life in his own cloister, nor the certain prospect of court
preferment, sufficed to satisfy his ambition. He had within him in
its fullest measure the apostolic fervour which animated so many of
his countrymen, and led them to carry back to the old Germanic
soil from whence they sprang the new faith which they had learnt in
Britain. Year after year there came the news of English missionaries
who had passed over into that huge province which then
extended between the Elbe and the Rhine, the greater part of which
was swallowed up in the inundation of 1287, and now forms the bed
of the Zuyder Zee. It was called Friesland, and was the chief seat
of the English missions. The first man who gave a certain sort of
shape and system to these missions was an English priest named
Egbert, who had been educated at Lindisfarne by Bishop Colman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and afterwards passed over to Ireland to improve himself in her
schools. The Anglo-Saxon scholars were accustomed at this time
to resort in great numbers to the sister isle, going about from one
master’s cell to another, to gather from each the science for which
he was most renowned. The Irish received them hospitably, and
furnished them with food, books, and teaching, gratis.</p>

<p>Egbert and his friend Edilhun were studying in the monastery of
Rathmelsigi, in Connaught, when the great pestilence of 664 broke
out, which caused such terrible ravages both in England and Ireland.
It was on this occasion that St. Ultan, bishop of Ardbraccan, collected
all the children who were left orphans, and had them brought
up in a hospital or asylum at his own charge. The two English
students were attacked by the plague, and Egbert, believing his
last hour was at hand, went out in the morning, and sitting alone in
a solitary place thought over his past life, and being full of compunction
at the thought of his sins, watered his face with his tears,
praying to God that he might yet have time granted him to do
penance. He also made a vow that should it please God to spare
his life, he would never return to his native land, but live abroad as
a stranger; and that besides the Divine Office of the Church he
would every day recite the entire Psalter, and every week pass one
whole day and night fasting. Edilhun died the next night, gently
reproaching his friend for having thus prevented their entering into
everlasting life together; and Egbert kept his vow and remained in
Ireland, doing good service as well to the Scots and Picts as to his
countrymen, for it was through his influence that the former at last
conformed to the Roman method of observing Easter, and his school
was resorted to by every Anglo-Saxon student who crossed the sea
in search of Divine wisdom. In his heart, however, Egbert nursed
a great design, which he was never suffered to carry out in person.
He desired to carry the Gospel among the races of Germany whence
the English were originally descended, and Wicbert, one of his companions,
being filled with the like desire, did actually proceed to
Frisia, and there preached for two whole years among the heathen,
but without much fruit. Egbert, understanding that it was not the
will of God that he should himself embrace a missionary life, and
being warned that his vocation lay rather among his own people,
cherished the hope of at least inspiring some of his scholars with the
apostolic spirit. Among these was Wilibrord, who, after receiving
his early education among the monks of Ripon, had passed over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
into Ireland in his twentieth year, attracted by the excellent science
which then flourished in her schools, and the fame of his learned
countryman. It appears probable that the two Ewalds, martyred
in Friesland in 695, were likewise pupils or friends of Egbert’s, for
Bede tells us that they were living strangers in Ireland for the sake of
the eternal kingdom; that both were pious, but that Black Ewald was
the more learned of the two. Wilibrord departed for Friesland in
696, accompanied by twelve fellow-missionaries; and the protection
of Pepin, who then ruled the Franks as mayor of the palace to the
Merovingian monarch, enabled him to pursue his apostolic career in
spite of the opposition of Radbod, the Pagan duke of the country. It
would be pleasant, did space permit it, to say something of his
labours;&mdash;to relate how he found his way into Denmark and brought
away thirty young Danes, whom he sent to be instructed in the
schools which he had founded at Treves and Utrecht; how on his
voyage back to Friesland he landed at Heligoland, the holy island of
the Saxons, but which then bore the name of Fosetesland, from the
hideous idol to whose worship it was dedicated. It was a wild,
mysterious spot. No animals that had once grazed on its sacred
herbage were suffered to be molested, and near the altar of the god
a clear stream bubbled up of which the natives never drank save in
awful silence, for the utterance of a single word would, as they
believed, bring down on them the vengeance of the dreaded Fosete.
Wilibrord caused some of the cattle to be killed for food, and
baptized three converts in the fountain, over the waters of which he
broke the mystic silence by pronouncing the invocation of the Holy
Trinity. This daring act excited the direful wrath of Radbod, and
on the death of Pepin, in 714, Wilibrord found himself forced to
leave the country. He was, however, reinstated in his bishopric of
Utrecht by Charles Martel, and in 717 we find him engaged in
destroying another Frisian idol in the isle of Walcheren.</p>

<p>Tales like these fired the heart of Winfrid with the desire of
sharing in such glorious enterprises. After a journey to Rome,
whither he went to obtain the authority and blessing of Pope
Gregory II., he joined Wilibrord at Utrecht, and for some time
laboured under his direction. But finding that the bishop intended
to have him appointed his successor, he fled away in alarm, and
took refuge in the heart of Germany, where he continued until 723,
preaching among the Saxons and Hessians. According to the old
writer, Adam of Bremen, “Winfrid, the philosopher of Christ,” as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
calls him, is undoubtedly to be regarded as the first apostle of that
part of the country. It was at this time that he gained a young
disciple, whose story is sufficiently connected with the subject which
we wish to illustrate to justify its insertion here. Adela, the daughter
of King Dagobert II., had founded a monastery at Treves, where,
on his journey from Friesland into Hesse, Winfrid was hospitably
received and entertained. After he had said mass, he sat down to
table with the abbess and her family; and her young grandson,
Gregory, a boy of fifteen, who had just come from the court school,
was summoned to read aloud the Latin Scriptures, according to
custom, during the repast. Having knelt and received the holy
missionary’s blessing, he took the book, and acquitted himself of his
task with sufficient success. “You read very well, my son,” said
Winfrid, “that is, if you understand what you are reading.” Gregory
replied that he did, and was about to continue the lecture, when
Winfrid interrupted him. “What I wish to know, my son, is
whether you can explain what you are reading in your native
tongue.” The youth confessed that he could not do this, but begged
the missionary to do so himself. “Begin again then,” said Winfrid,
“and read distinctly;” and this being done, he took occasion to
deliver to the abbess and the rest of the community, a discourse so
sublime and touching, that when they rose from table Gregory
sought his grandmother, and announced his determination of following
their guest, that he might learn the Scriptures from him, and become
his disciple. “How foolish!” said the abbess; “he is a man
of whom we know nothing: I cannot tell you whence he comes, or
whither he goes.” “I care nothing for that,” replied Gregory; “and
if you will not give me a horse, I will follow him on foot.” His
importunity prevailed, and he was permitted to join the company of
Winfrid, and journey with him into Thuringia.</p>

<p>The prodigious success that accompanied the labours of Winfrid,
having reached the ears of Pope Gregory II. he was summoned to
Rome, and there consecrated bishop of the German nation. At the
same time he received his new name of Boniface, and solemnly
signed an oath of fidelity to the Holy See, which he placed on the
tomb of the Apostles. Then returning to Germany he pursued his
apostolic career along the banks of the Rhine and the Danube; he
penetrated into the wild fastnesses of Hesse, cut down in the ancient
Hercynian forest the huge <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Donner Eiche</i>, or thunder oak, sacred
to Jupiter, and erected a wooden chapel out of its timbers, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
spot where now stands the town of Geismar. Within the space of
twenty years one hundred thousand converts had abjured their
idols and received baptism, but the work as it grew on his
hands required additional labourers. The eloquence which in old
time had earned for the monk Winfrid a scholar’s fame, was now
employed to rouse the apostolic spirit in the hearts of his countrymen,
and a circular letter addressed to the bishops and abbots of England,
painted the wants of the German mission in such moving terms that
his appeal was quickly responded to, and he soon found himself surrounded
by a noble band of missioners, among whom were Burchard,
Lullus, Wilibald, and Winibald, the two last named being nephews
of the saint.</p>

<p>We find from the lives of these great men, written by their
immediate followers, that the same form of community life was
adopted among them which we have seen had been already established
in the English dioceses. The bishop and his clergy formed a
kind of college;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and, in this episcopal monastery, as it may be
called, the younger clerics were trained in letters and ecclesiastical
discipline. The college thus founded by St. Wilibald at Ordorp,
became so famous as to draw learned men from all parts of Europe
to take part in his labours among the populations of Hesse and
Thuringia. Yet more renowned was the episcopal seminary, founded
at Utrecht by St. Gregory, the young disciple of St. Boniface already
named, who, after completing his studies at Ordorp, and following
the saint through the long course of his missions, was sent by him
a little before his death to administer the see of Utrecht, then
vacant by the death of Wilibrord. Gregory formed his clergy into
a community, which he governed in person, and was joined by
many illustrious Englishmen, among whom was St. Lebwin, the
apostle of Overyssel, and the patron saint of Deventer. The seminary
of Utrecht produced some famous <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alumni</i>, of whom I will name
but one whose history cannot be altogether passed over in a narrative
of schools and schoolboys. Luidger was the son of a Friesian
noble, who confided him to St. Gregory’s care at a very early age.
In fact, Luidger’s somewhat premature commencement of his school
life was the result of his own entreaties. He was a precocious child,
who cared nothing at all for play, and so soon as he could walk and
talk gave signs of a passion for books and reading. Whilst his
companions were engaged in the sports of the age he would gather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
together pieces of bark off the trees and busy himself in making
little books out of these materials. Then he would imitate writing
with whatever fluid he could find, and running to his nurse with these
fine treasures, bid her take care of them, as though they had been
the most precious codices. If any one asked him what he had been
doing all day, he would reply that he had been making books; and
if further questioned as to who had taught him to read and write,
he would answer “God taught me.” It will not seem astonishing
that a child of this temper should be possessed with a strong desire
to learn how to read and write in good earnest. Yielding to his
persevering request his parents accordingly sent him to Utrecht,
where Gregory placed him in his school and gave him the tonsure.
The Monk of Werden, who wrote his life, records his sweetness
with his companions, and his devotion in church. He was always
reading, singing, or praying; and always to be seen with a bright
and smiling countenance, though seldom moved to laughter. And
there was something about him so winning and amiable, that master
and schoolfellows all loved him alike. In course of time he was
sent to England to receive deacon’s orders, Gregory himself not
having received episcopal consecration; and here, for the first time,
he became acquainted with Alcuin, whose scholastic career was
just then commencing. Luidger returned to Utrecht, but an unfortunate
blunder which he made in the public reading of a lesson, and
which drew down on him a severe reproof from his abbot, suggested
to him the desirableness of a further course of study, under the
great English master. Gregory reluctantly consented to his plan,
and Luidger undertook a second voyage to England, and spent
three years and a half in the school of York. Here he was as
popular as he had formerly been at Utrecht, and his biographer
seems half disposed to think that the extraordinary signs of affection
lavished on him by his masters and fellow-students require some
excuse, for he tells us they really could not help it, and that any one
who had known him must have done the same. To none, however,
was he so dear as to Alcuin, who always bestowed on him the title
of “son.” During his residence in York, Luidger read through the
whole of the Old and New Testaments besides a great many books
of secular literature, and thoroughly studied the monastic rule as it
was carried out in the English monasteries; and at the end of that
time he returned to Utrecht, laden with books, and well fitted to
instruct others. Alberic, the successor of Gregory, ordained him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
priest, and sent him to preach in his own country, till the Saxons
drove him out, and then he became the apostle of that people also.
Charlemagne heard of his merit from Alcuin, who by that time was
fixed at the imperial court, and by his orders, sorely against the will
of the missioner, Luidger was consecrated first bishop of Mimigardford
in Saxony. He immediately founded a great monastery of
regular canons to serve his cathedral, from which circumstance the
name of the place was changed to Minster, or Münster, which it still
bears. But his favourite foundation was at Werden, a spot which he
had chosen in the midst of the huge virgin forests which clothed the
banks of the river Rura. The old legend makes us understand
what sort of work was involved in these foundations, when it tells us
that the bishop and his companions, having pitched their tents, prepared
to cut down the trees and clear a space large enough to contain
a few rude huts; but they were dismayed when they beheld the
massive trunks of the growth of centuries, with their branches so
thickly interlaced that they could catch no glimpse of the sky, while
the summits of the mighty oaks seemed to touch the clouds. They
determined to wait till morning to commence their task; and
meanwhile Luidger knelt down beneath one of the largest oaks, and
was soon absorbed in his devotions. It was then a clear and
beautiful night, the moon and stars shining unclouded in the heavens.
Gradually, however, the clouds gathered, the wind arose, and a
furious tempest burst over the forest. The monks heard the crash
of falling trunks and trembled with fear; they guessed not that the
stormy elements were being forced to do them service. When
morning dawned there was an open space around them, the trees lay
prostrate on all sides, and a sufficient space was cleared for the
foundation of the monastery. One tree alone remained untouched,
it was that beneath which St. Luidger had prayed, and which was
long reverentially preserved. When at last it was cut down, a stone
was placed on the site in memory of the event.</p>

<p>In these episcopal monasteries Luidger established a course of
sacred studies, over which he personally presided. Such was, in fact,
the universal discipline observed by the German missionaries, and
hence the institution of cathedral schools spread over every province
from Denmark to the mountains of the Tyrol. There we find the
same class of foundations established by St. Virgil, Bishop of Saltzburg,
concerning whom it will be necessary to speak a little more
particularly. He was a native of Ireland, and held to be one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
most learned men of his time. It appears probable, though it is by
no means certain, that he is the same Virgil who, when still a simple
priest, was sent into Bavaria, together with Sidonius, and was there
reported to have given expression to certain scientific theories of
doubtful orthodoxy. It is not easy at the present day to determine
precisely what the supposed errors were, as the only notice of them
that remains occurs in a letter from St. Boniface to Pope Zachary,
wherein Virgil is charged with teaching “that there is another world,
and other men under the earth, another sun and another moon.”
The reply of the Pope was to the effect that if on examination by a
council Virgil should be convicted of teaching this “perverse doctrine,”
he should be degraded; and the matter was finally settled by
his being summoned to Rome, where inquiry was made into the facts
of the case. It would seem that his explanation of his own doctrine
must have proved satisfactory, if the priest Virgil here spoken of
were the same who was shortly afterwards raised to the see of Saltzburg,
and who in 1233 was solemnly canonised by Pope Gregory IX.
These facts have, however, furnished the groundwork of a story
which has been repeated by D’Alembert, and adopted with all its
crowd of attendant blunders by a host of modern imitators. According
to this version, Virgil, Bishop of Saltzburg, was excommunicated
by St. Boniface for teaching the existence of the antipodes, and this
sentence is represented to have been confirmed by Pope Zachary.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
It will be seen, however, that the person of whose doctrines Boniface
complained was not a bishop, but a priest; that the opinions attributed
to him bore no reference to the antipodes; that he was not
excommunicated; and that so far from either passing or confirming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
such a sentence, the Holy See examined, and it is to be presumed
approved his doctrine, since it raised him to a bishopric, and at a
subsequent period canonised him. St. Boniface reported the supposed
errors of Virgil as they were reported to him, and whatever
may be understood by the expressions which he quotes, they cannot
be held to signify a belief in the antipodes. They rather seem to
point to some theory of the existence of another race of men, distinct
in origin from the sons of Adam, who therefore shared neither in
original sin nor the benefits of redemption, errors which, as Baronius
shows, might reasonably be styled ‘perverse.’ It is indeed true that
Bede, and other early writers on natural philosophy, did not believe
in the antipodes; not, as Mr. Turner remarks, from “any superstitious
scruple,” but because they followed the geographical system of
Pliny, who imagined the climate of the southern hemisphere to be
incapable of supporting human life. Yet this history of Virgil and
his condemned propositions has been made the occasion of impeaching
St. Bede, St. Boniface, and the whole race of monastic scholars,
not only of considering a belief in the antipodes as heretical, but of
denying the spherical form of the earth, a point which was certainly
never involved in the controversy.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Next to the foundation of churches and monasteries, St. Boniface
trusted to the establishment of public schools for the consolidation
of the faith in the newly converted countries. In every place where
he planted a monastic colony a school was opened, not merely for
the instruction of the younger monks, but in order that the rude
population by whom they were surrounded might be trained in holy
discipline, and that their uncivilised manners might be softened by
the influence of humane learning. At Fritislar and at Utrecht, as
afterwards at Fulda, public schools were therefore opened, and how
nearly the maintenance and prosperity of these schools lay at the
heart of their founder, may be gathered from the epistle which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
wrote shortly before his martyrdom to Fulrad, the councillor of King
Pepin, in which he implores the protection of that monarch for such
of his disciples as were engaged in the work of educating children.
We also find incidental notices in his letters of certain monks
appointed by him to the post of schoolmasters (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magistri infantium</i>).</p>

<p>St. Lullus, who has been named above among the companions of
St. Boniface, and who was destined in after years to become his successor,
had been educated at Malmsbury, whence he removed to
Jarrow and finished his studies under Bede. Nine of his letters are
preserved among those of St. Boniface, and in one of them, addressed
to Cuthbert, abbot of Wearmouth, he entreats that copies of the
works of his venerable master may be sent to him without delay.
Cuthbert’s reply shows in what esteem Bede was already held as a
writer, both at home and abroad, and how great was the demand for
his works, which the copyists could not multiply fast enough. He
begs for a little indulgence, seeing that the terrible cold of the past
winter has disabled the hands of his best writers. “Since you have
asked me for some works of the Blessed Bede,” he says, “I have prepared,
with the help of my boys, what I now send you, namely, his
books in prose and verse on the man of God, Cuthbert. I would
have sent you more had I been able. But this winter the frost in
our island has been so severe, with terrible winds, that the fingers of
our transcribers have been unable to execute any more books.”
Here is a glimpse into what one may call the real life of the scriptorium,
which we are sometimes disposed to regard in a certain
picturesque and sentimental light. Incessant labour and chapped
hands formed part of the business, and the severities of climate made
themselves felt in rooms entirely destitute of the appliances of
modern comfort. Cuthbert goes on to entreat St. Lullus to send
him if possible some foreign artificers skilled in the art of making
glass vessels, and also a <em>harper</em>. “I have a harp,” he says, “but no
one who knows how to play on it.” The whole correspondence of
St. Boniface and St. Lullus bears witness to the deep interest felt by
their countrymen in the work on which they were engaged. Their
letters are addressed to bishops, abbots, monks, and nuns, and show
how close an intercourse was kept up with England in spite of the
difficulties of communication. Presents are exchanged between the
absent missionaries and their friends at home. While the English
kings and prelates send contributions of books and altar-plate, and
the English nuns despatch a welcome supply of clothing, Boniface<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
sends back a chasuble, “not all of silk, but mingled with goats’ hair,”
and some linen cloths, which, before the linen manufactory had
been introduced into England, were highly prized luxuries. To
another friend he presents some fine German falcons. Some of the
letters preserved are of peculiar interest, as showing us what kind of
learning was then pursued in the religious houses of England, and
specially in those of the English nuns, whom Mabillon calls, “the
peculiar glory of the Order.” Boniface in former years had directed
the studies of several convents of religious women, and kept up an
active correspondence with his old pupils, who entered heartily into
all his interests, and forwarded them to the best of their power.
Naturally enough, their talk is often of books. In one of his earliest
letters, addressed to the Kentish abbess Eadburga, he begs her to
send him the “Acts of the Martyrs;” and in her reply, which is
written in Latin, she informs him that, together with the literary offering,
she has sent him fifty pieces of gold and an altar carpet. Her
liberality encourages him to beg for new favours; and whilst he
thanks her for her present, he petitions that she will get written out
for him, either by herself or her scholars, the Epistles of St. Paul in
<em>letters of gold</em>, in order to inspire his neophytes with greater reverence
for the Holy Scriptures. In his next epistle he rewards her diligence
with the appropriate present of a silver pen.</p>

<p>Eadburga removed to Rome, whence many of her letters to Boniface
were afterwards addressed. But the correspondence continued
to be carried on by some of the pupils whom she had left behind her
in England, and specially by a relation of the saint’s named Lioba,
then a religious in the convent of Wimbourne.</p>

<p>Of this convent and its learned inmates I must say a few words, as
they deserve a place in our catalogue of English scholars. The
present collegiate church of Wimbourne, ancient as it is&mdash;and the
architecture of its tower bears out its claim to have been founded by
the Confessor&mdash;does but mark the site of that far more ancient
minster which owed its erection to the two sisters of good King Ina,
Cuthburga and Guenburga by name. This was one of the very
earliest convents of women founded in England, and is noticed by
St. Aldhelm in a letter written in 705, wherein he declares that he has
purposed, in the hidden recesses of his soul, to grant the privilege of
free election to certain monasteries in his diocese; among others,
that which lieth by the river Wimburnia, presided over by Cuthburga,
sister to the king. Perhaps he was moved to this act of favour by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the fact that Cuthburga and Guenburga were pupils of his old friend
the abbess Hildelitha, the first of English virgins who had consecrated
herself to Christ. Hildelitha received her education at Chelles, in
France, and brought into the cloisters of Barking all the learning of
that famous school. This she increased by her intercourse with St.
Aldhelm; and her disciples, as we have seen, were rather profoundly
versed in sacred letters. Neither did the Wimbourne scholars
decline in learning under the good abbess Tetta, who was governing
a community of five hundred nuns with admirable wisdom at the
time when Lioba first introduced herself to the notice of St. Boniface
in the following graceful letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To the most noble lord, decorated with the pontifical dignity,
Boniface, most dear to me in Christ, and, what is more, united to
me by the ties of blood, Leobgitha, the last of the handmaids of
Christ, health and salvation.</p>

<p>“I beg your clemency to condescend to recollect the friendship
which you had some time ago for my father. His name was Tinne;
he lived in the western parts, and died about eight years ago. My
mother also desires to be remembered by you; her name is Ebba,
she is related to you, and suffers much from infirmity. I am their
only daughter, and desire, though unworthy, to claim you as my
brother, for there are none of my relations in whom I have so much
confidence as in you. I send you a little present, not as being
worthy of your greatness, but that you may preserve the memory of
my littleness, and may not forget me on account of the distance
which separates us. What I chiefly ask of you, dearest brother, is
that you will defend me by the buckler of your prayers from the
hidden snares of the enemy. I beg you to excuse the rustic style of
this letter, and not to refuse me a few words from your affability
which may serve me as a model, and which I shall be eager to
receive. As to the little verses you will find written below, I have
endeavoured to compose them according to the rules of poetry, not
out of presumption, but as a first attempt of my weak little genius,
desiring the help of your elegant mind. I learnt this art from
Eadburga, who ceased not to meditate on the Divine law day and
night. Farewell; live long and happy, and pray for me.”</p>

<p>Then follow four rhymed hexameters in Latin, wherein she not
inelegantly commends him to the protection of Heaven. This was a
common way of concluding a letter in the eighth century, and St.
Boniface, in his epistles to his friends, frequently relieves the graver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
subjects of which he treats by a Latin distich or acrostic; sometimes
also by a scrap of Saxon verse. He responded very heartily to
Lioba’s appeal, and a familiar correspondence was at once opened
between them. It is supposed, with every show of probability, that
the <em>lady</em> to whom St. Boniface afterwards dedicated his poem on the
Virtues was no other than the Anglo-Saxon nun. In the dedication
to this poem he says, “I send to my sister ten golden apples gathered
on the tree of life, where they hung amid the flowers.” These golden
apples are ten enigmas, each containing the definition of some virtue,
the name of which, in true Saxon taste, is formed by the initial letters
of the lines.</p>

<p>Another of the most constant correspondents and advisers of
Boniface was his old diocesan, Daniel of Winchester, whom he
frequently consulted in the difficulties with which he was beset.
Ozanam observes that the former grammarian and scholasticus peeps
out in one of the questions he sends for solution; namely, if the
baptism were valid, administered by a certain priest who was in the
habit of using the form, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In nomine Patria et Filia, et Spiritui
Sancta</i>?<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But we may, I think, acquit our great apostle of the
charge of pedantry, founded on this passage. He was engaged in
planting the Church on a new soil, and a scrupulous exactness, in
preserving the sacramental forms of words from corruption, need not
be taken as a sign of scholastic priggishness. There is no saying
where the “Patria et Filia” might have ended, or what more extensive
variations might not have been added by the <em>il</em>-literati of
Thuringia. Bishop Daniel gave him a great deal of excellent advice,
and was of considerable service to Boniface by supplying him with
books. On one occasion we find the missionary writing to his good
friend, begging him to send the book of the Prophets “which the
abbot Wimbert, my master, left at his death. It is written in large
and very distinct letters; I could not have a greater consolation in
my old age, for there is no book like it in this country, and as my
sight grows weak I cannot distinguish the small letters which run
together in the volumes I now have.”</p>

<p>In 732, Boniface received the pallium from the hands of Pope
Gregory III., together with the authority of Papal Legate and Vicar
over the bishops of France and Germany. This office empowered
him to take every step necessary for the firm establishment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
faith in the newly converted countries, and at the same time he was
charged with the far more difficult task of restoring Church discipline
in the Gallican provinces, where, owing to the barbarism of the
times, a frightful state of anarchy prevailed. We shall chiefly follow
him in his apostolic career in Germany, where his first care was to
provide for the necessities of the infant Church by the erection of
several new sees. Burchard was consecrated Bishop of Wurtzburg,
and Wilibald was appointed to the see of Eichstadt, a woody district
overspread with oaks, which as yet contained but one small church.
Other prelates were named to fill the sees of Erfurt, Ratisbon, and
Friesingen. The care of the Archbishop was next directed to providing
a succession of clergy for the new dioceses, and with this view
he founded several monasteries, one of which became in after-times
the greatest monastic school in Germany. In the year 730, when
Boniface travelled into Bavaria, to re-establish ecclesiastical discipline
in that country, many Bavarian nobles committed their sons to his
care, and among these was Sturm, who was offered by his parents
to the service of God. Boniface placed him in the monastery he
had recently founded at Fritzlar, under the care of Wigbert, one of
his English disciples, and took great care of his education. The
innocence and humility of the youth made him dear to all his masters,
and he quickly learnt the Psalter by heart, and studied the hidden
sense of the sacred Scriptures. Being ordained priest, he preached
among the neighbouring population for three years, but at the end
of that time he was seized with the desire to seek out some solitude
where he might found a religious house; and Boniface, approving
his design, sent him into the forest of Buchonia to choose a fitting
site. Taking two companions with him, they travelled on for two
days, seeing nothing but the earth and the sky, and the huge trees
through which they made their way. At the end of the third day
they reached Hirsfield, where they built themselves some rude huts
with the bark of the trees which they felled, and began the practices
of a religious life. Boniface, however, was not satisfied with their
choice of a situation, and at his desire, Sturm, after exploring the
upper course of the river Fulda without success, set out alone,
mounted on an ass, on a journey into the wilderness, through which
he travelled for days, seeing nothing but the huge trees, the birds,
and the wild beasts that roamed at large in the forest glades. At
night he cut down wood enough with his axe to make a little
enclosure, within which he fastened his beast to save it from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
wolves; but for himself he feared nothing, and after tranquilly
making the sign of the cross on his forehead, he lay down and slept
till morning. At last he reached a vast and woody solitude, which
Prince Carloman, the owner, bestowed on him as a free gift, and
here, in the year 744, nine years after their settlement at Hirsfield,
Sturm, with seven companions, laid the foundation of the Abbey of
Fulda. St. Boniface gave them the necessary instructions, and
visited them every year; but being desirous to establish among them
the rule of St. Benedict in its perfection, he sent Sturm into Italy
to visit the monastery of Monte Cassino, and others most renowned
for their strict observance, that he might be the better able to form
his own community in regular discipline. After a year thus spent
in studying the monastic rule, Sturm returned to Fulda, where,
before he died, he had the consolation of seeing a zealous community
of 400 monks serving God in what had before been a
desolate wilderness, and the abbey, like all those founded by St.
Boniface, became quickly renowned for the sanctity of its inmates,
and the good scholars whom it nurtured within its walls.</p>

<p>To complete the conversion and civilisation of the country,
Boniface conceived the plan of bringing over some religious women
from England, and establishing them in various parts, that they might
provide the means of education to their own sex. Othlonus, in his
history, names Chunihilt and her daughter Berathgilt as the first
Englishwomen who passed over into Germany at the invitation of
Boniface, and calls them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valde eruditæ in liberali scientia</i>. But their
renown has been eclipsed by that of St. Lioba, to whom the archbishop
naturally turned as the likeliest of his English friends to aid
him in his great designs. In fact, there were many at Wimbourne
disposed to enter heart and soul into the interests of the German
mission. Lioba and her cousin Thecla were nearly related to the
archbishop, and Walburga was sister to his two companions,
Winibald and Wilibald. He knew that their acquirements qualified
them to teach others. They had all been carefully trained by the
abbess Tetta, and were skilful, not merely in the womanly art of the
needle, but likewise in sacred literature. Lioba’s accomplishments
may be truly called surprising, when we remember that their owner
was a nun, living in the middle of the eighth century in a remote
abbey of a half-barbarous land. Instructed from her childhood in
grammar, poetry, and the liberal arts, she had increased her treasure
of learning by assiduous reading. She had attentively studied the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Old and New Testaments, and committed a great part of them to
memory. She was familiar with the writings of the Fathers, and
with the decrees and canons of the Church&mdash;grave sort of reading
for so fair a student&mdash;(and I do not use the epithet in a conventional
sense, for her biographer tells us she was named Lioba, or the
<em>beloved one</em>, because of her exceeding beauty); but in those days
lighter literature there was none. As we have seen, she could write
in the Latin tongue with a graceful simplicity, both in prose and
verse. When not engaged in study she worked with her hands, as
was enjoined by the rule, but she greatly preferred reading, or hearing
others read, to manual employments. Indeed, it was not easy
to satisfy her in this respect. When abbess, she insisted on all
those under her charge taking that midday repose allowed by the
rule of St. Benedict, chiefly, as she said, because the want of sleep
takes away the love of reading. But when she herself lay down at
these times to rest, she had some of her pupils to read the Scriptures
by the side of her couch, and they could not omit or mispronounce a
word without her correcting it, though apparently she might be
asleep. Yet all this learning was accompanied with a modesty and
humility that made her seek in all things to be regarded as the least
in the house. There was nothing of arrogance in her behaviour,
nothing of bitterness in her words, says her biographer, Ralph of
Fulda. “She was as admirable in her understanding as she was
boundless in her charity. She liked to wash the feet of her spiritual
children, and to serve them at table, and she did this when she
herself was fasting. Her countenance was truly angelic, always
sweet and joyful, though she never indulged in laughter. No one
ever saw her angry, and her aspect agreed with her name, which in
Saxon signifies the Beloved, and in Greek, Philomena.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>It was in 748 that the letters from St. Boniface reached Wimbourne,
requesting that Lioba, Thecla, and Walburga might be sent
over to him, together with as many of their companions as might be
willing to share in their enterprise. Thirty nuns at once offered
themselves, and the little colony, after a stormy passage across the
sea to Antwerp,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> was met at Mentz by the archbishop, who proceeded
to establish Lioba in a monastery he had built for her at Bischoffsheim,
where she very soon collected a numerous congregation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
holy virgins. Walburga went on to Thuringia, where her brother,
Winibald, was superior of seven houses of monks. He had long
purposed retiring to some greater solitude, and, with the advice of
his brother, he chose a wild valley in the diocese, clothed with
majestic forests and watered by mountain streams. It bore the
name of Heidensheim; and here, in 752, Winibald, having cleared
the ground, erected a church and two monasteries, one for himself
and his monks, the other for Walburga’s community. The savage
natives beheld with jealous eyes this intrusion into their solitudes,
and the destruction of their sacred oaks; but ere a few years had
passed, the minster of Heidensheim stood in the centre of a Christian
population, and the wild pagan forest had been converted into
a smiling land of woods and pastures, where all the arts of civilised
life were taught and practised in a society over which the abbot
presided with something like paternal sway.</p>

<p>Walburga and her nuns seem to have cultivated letters as diligently
in their forest home as by the banks of the Wimburnia. The
travels of St. Wilibald, who had made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem,
and often related what he had seen to his sister and her nuns, were
afterwards written by them, not certainly in very classical Latin,
but with a lucidity and truthfulness of style which appears in all the
Anglo-Saxon writers, and which contrasts very remarkably with the
marvellous narrations of Sir John Mandeville. St. Walburga appears
also to have been the author of the “Life of St. Winibald,” and it is
quite clear that the singular taste for literature existing among
German nuns in the tenth century formed part of the tradition which
they had received from their Anglo-Saxon foundresses. Mabillon
praises not merely their erudition, but the zeal they displayed in
employing it for the good of their neighbours, and says that, moved
by a laudable emulation, they devoted themselves to study and the
transcription of books with no less energy than the monks. He
particularly praises the nuns of Eiken, who employed their time in
reading, meditating, transcribing, and painting; specially the two
abbesses Harlinda and Renilda, who wrote out the Psalter, the four
Gospels, and many other books of Holy Scripture, adorning them
with liquid gold, gems, and pearls.</p>

<p>The after-career of St. Boniface exhibits him to us reforming the
Frankish Church, long vexed with schism and other frightful disorders,
which had grown out of a century of treasons and civil
distractions unequalled in any history. The enemies of discipline<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
were naturally enough enemies also to the authority of the Holy See.
They had taken advantage of the chaotic state to which society had
returned to reject the law of clerical celibacy, and to establish the
practice of simony on a gigantic scale. St. Boniface struck at the
root of the evil by enforcing obedience to the Roman pontiff, and,
happily for the future destinies of the French Church, his efforts
were heartily supported by the brothers Carloman and Pepin, the
two mayors of the palace, and the real sovereigns of Gaul. His
canons of reform were promulgated in a grand national council, and
in 748 Pope Zachary established the authority of the see of Mentz
over all the German provinces from Utrecht to the Rhetian Alps.
One would have thought that the government of such a province
would have sufficed to employ the energies of one man; but
Boniface kept a place in his thoughts for the necessities of his native
land. Exile as he was, he never forgot that he was an Englishman,
and though it does not appear that he ever revisited his own country,
he took a very active part in some of her affairs. It is rather
puzzling to make out how in those days of rude civilization the
German missionaries contrived to carry on their voluminous correspondence
with friends at home, for the transmission of letters was
certainly not provided for by any international postage regulations.
It appears, however, from many passages in the letters of St.
Boniface that his mails were brought to him by the Anglo-Saxon
pilgrims who were continually streaming from England to Rome.
Some of these were students, going to make their studies in the
Saxon school, lately established in the holy city by King Ina;
others were devout monks; and others, unhappily, rather indevout
and disedifying characters, who made their pilgrimage a pretext for
gadding about the world, and casting off the restraints of respectability.
The see of Canterbury was at that time filled by a great
friend of St. Boniface, named Cuthbert, who applied to him for help
and advice in the sore troubles which surrounded him. The evil
example of Ethelbald, King of Mercia, was causing a grievous
relaxation of discipline among the clergy, whereby many grave
scandals were brought on the Church, and St. Boniface did not
hesitate to address the king a letter of remonstrance, which seems
to have produced its effect. In 747, the Council of Cloveshoe
was summoned for the reform of abuses by command of Pope
Zachary, Ethelbald also giving it the weight of his presence and
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>The Fathers of this Council owed much to the advice of Boniface,
and their decrees, which are exceedingly interesting, have a good
deal to say on the subject of education. They ordain that priests
should constantly teach and explain the Creed and the “Our Father”
in the vulgar tongue; that bishops, abbots, and abbesses do by all
means diligently provide that all their people incessantly apply their
minds to reading; that boys be brought up in the ecclesiastical
schools, so as to be useful to the Church of God, and that their
masters do not employ them in bodily labour. Sunday is to be strictly
observed, and no man is to dare to do any servile work on that day,
save for the preparing of his meat; but if it be necessary for him to
journey on that day he may ride, row, or travel by any conveyance
he chooses, provided he first hear mass. It is only fitting that every
man should honour that day, on which God created light, sent
manna to the Israelites, rose from the dead, and sent down the
Holy Ghost, and it is also fitting that Christian men should prepare
for its celebration by coming to church on Saturday, bringing a light
with them, and then hearing evensong, and after midnight, prime
also; being careful whilst there to keep a peaceful mind, and not to
dispute or quarrel. Our forefathers were not left in uncertainty as
to what was comprised under the head of servile work, for on this
point Archbishop Theodore had laid down rules of great exactness.
He divided it into two heads, man’s work, and woman’s work; the
first of which comprised husbandry, garden work, the felling of trees,
the building of houses and walls, the quarrying of stone, and the
digging of ditches; while to the gentler sex belonged weaving,
washing, sewing, baking, brewing, wool-combing, the beating of flax
and the shearing of sheep. The feeling with which the observance
of the Sunday was regarded is best expressed by the beautiful Saxon
word by which it was called, the <i lang="osx" xml:lang="osx">freolsday</i>, or day of <em>freedom</em>, on
which even serfs did not do serfs’ work. The <i lang="osx" xml:lang="osx">freolsung</i>, or Sunday
freedom, lasted from noontide on Saturday to the dawn of light on
Monday morning&mdash;other similar seasons of freedom being established
at the greater festivals. The council likewise enjoined the exercise
of private prayer after the accustomed formula, wherein prayer
to the saints and intercession for the dead are specially named.
In church schools every one is to learn the psalter by heart, even
if he cannot master the art of chanting it, and the chant itself,
as well as the ritual for the administration of the Sacraments, the
order of feasts, and everything else appertaining to divine worship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
is ordered to be exactly conformed to the custom of the Roman
Church.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>It may be asked what are the schools to which reference is made
in these decrees? Chiefly, no doubt, the Episcopal and monastic
seminaries; but it would seem that the mass priest’s school is also
intended, of which mention is often made in the Anglo-Saxon
councils. Among our Saxon forefathers the education of the children
of his parishioners was recognised as one of the chief duties of the
parish priest. “Mass-priests shall always have in their houses a
school of learners; and if any good man will trust his little ones to
them for lore, they shall right gladly receive and kindly teach them.
For ye shall remember that it is written: ‘They that be learned
shall shine as heaven’s brightness; and they that instruct many to
justice shall shine as stars for ever.’ They shall not however, for
such lore, demand anything of the parents, besides that which the
latter may give of their own will.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This decree, the parentage of
which is to be traced to the Council of Vaison, reappears in the acts
of several councils of England, France, and Italy, the very language
being preserved in the Carlovingian Council of Orleans, and in the
Constitutions of Atto of Vercelli. And here we see the origin of
our parochial schools, which are as emphatically the priest’s schools,
as the seminaries are the schools of the bishop.</p>

<p>The career of Boniface was now drawing to its close, and he seized
the occasion of Pepin’s coronation to obtain the sanction of the new
monarch to a design he had long secretly cherished. It was that
of resigning his dignities, and ending his life, as he had begun it, in
humble missionary labours. He accordingly wrote, entreating the
king’s protection for his churches, clergy, and scholars. “I beg his
highness,” he says, “in the name of Christ, to let me know, while I
live, in what way he will deal with my disciples after my death.
For they are, almost all of them, foreigners; some are priests established
in distant places, others monks <em>employed in their different
cloisters in the education of youth</em>, some of them are old men, who
have been for years the companions and sharers of my labours.
Therefore I am most anxious that they should not be disturbed after
my death, but should remain under the protection of the king.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Pepin having fully granted all his wishes, and recognised Lullus,
whom, by permission of Pope Zachary, Boniface had named as his
successor, the archbishop published the charter granted by the Holy
See to the abbots of Fulda, which exempted it from episcopal jurisdiction,
and made over to Lullus the church of St. Martin at Utrecht,
the ancient see of his predecessor and countryman, St. Wilibrord.
When all these arrangements had been made, St. Boniface joyfully
prepared for his fourth and last expedition to Frisia, where he seems
to have already anticipated receiving the martyr’s crown. He wrote
to Lullus early in 755 telling him that the end of his life was
approaching, and bidding him finish the church of Fulda, in which
he desired that his body might be laid. “Prepare all things for my
journey,” he says, “and do not forget to enclose with my books a
shroud, to contain my mortal remains.”</p>

<p>He would not depart without bidding farewell to St. Lioba, whom
he recommended to his successor, giving orders that at her death
she also might be buried in the church of Fulda, that together they
might await the resurrection. Having nothing of greater value to
bestow on her, he gave her, as his parting gift, his monk’s cowl, a
precious token of his fatherly regard, and of the absolute poverty
which he professed. He then set out, attended by Eoban, an Anglo-Saxon
monk, whom he had consecrated Bishop of the Frisians, and
fifty-one companions, of whom ten only were priests; and, sailing
down the Rhine, made his way into Eastern Friesland. A great
number of the pagans were induced by his preaching to embrace the
faith; and June 5, being the vigil of Pentecost, was fixed for the
administration of Holy Baptism. A tent was erected on a plain
near the banks of a little river, not far from the modern town of
Dokkum. But whilst the saint awaited his converts, the tidings
reached him that a band of pagans were approaching, armed with
shields and spears. The laymen in his company would have offered
resistance, but Boniface forbade them to draw their swords. “Forbear,
my sons,” he said, “for the Scripture teaches us to return not
evil for evil, but rather good. To me the long-expected day has at
last arrived: the time of my departure is at hand. Be comforted,
and fear not them who can destroy the body, for they cannot touch
the immortal soul. Trust in God and rejoice in Him, and fix the
anchor of your hope in Him who will give you a place in His glorious
mansion together with the angels.”</p>

<p>Whilst he was yet speaking, the barbarians rushed on him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
struck him to the ground. As he fell, with the instinct of self-preservation,
he raised the hand which held the Book of the Gospels,
in order to protect his head. A sword-stroke from one ruffian cut
through the book, while at the same time the dagger of another
pierced his heart; and the rest of the band turned on his companions
who stood around, and slaughtered them every one. They then
seized the baggage of the archbishop, which they hoped would prove
a rich booty, but to their disappointment found nothing but books
and holy relics, which they scattered about the surrounding fields,
casting some of the books into a neighbouring marsh, whence they
were afterwards rescued by the Frisian Christians. Three of them
are still preserved at Fulda; they consist of the copy of the Gospel
already mentioned, which had been written out by the saint’s own
hand, and which, though cut through with the sword which took his
life, has not so much as a letter destroyed; a Harmony of the
Gospels or Canons of the New Testament, and a Book containing
various Treatises and Letters, the pages of which are stained with
his blood.</p>

<p>The body of St. Boniface was carried to Mentz, and thence
translated to Fulda, when the church of that monastery was consecrated
by St. Lullus, the whole history of the event being related by
the monk Candidus, in his metrical Life of Abbot Eigil. St. Lioba
survived her friend for twenty-four years, during which time she
founded a great number of convents, all of which she governed as
superior. She received special marks of respect from Charlemagne
and his queen Hildegardis, who often sent for her to Aix-la-Chapelle,
and loved her as her own soul. She frequently visited Fulda, and
on her death, which took place in 779, her body was carried thither
for burial. The elder monks remembered the wish that had been
expressed by St. Boniface, that their bones should be laid together,
but, fearing to open the sepulchre of the holy martyr, they buried St.
Lioba at the north side of the altar, which he had himself consecrated
in honour of the twelve Apostles. There the two saints still repose,
for though the church of Fulda has been rebuilt four times since the
day of its first dedication, the ancient crypt has always been preserved,
and there the English pilgrim may still revere the relics of
his great countryman which are preserved in their antique shrine,
together with two memorials of him, the ivory crosier which he was
accustomed to use, and the dagger that shed his blood.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the moment when the nascent civilisation of Saxon England was
being doomed to extinction, and the Danish hordes were everywhere
making havoc of those religious houses which for 160 years had
been the chief nurseries of learning in the West, light was beginning
once more to dawn over the schools of France, where under the
barbarism of the Merovingian kings liberal studies had all but entirely
decayed. At an earlier period indeed, as we have seen, the Church
of Gaul, far from deserving the charge of barbarism, had produced
a crowd of illustrious writers, by whom the Christian dogmas were
clothed in a classic dress. Down to the end of the sixth century
remains of the old Roman municipal schools continued to exist,
wherein Christian students disdained not “to hold the harp with
Orpheus, or the rule with Archimedes; to perceive with Pythagoras,
to explain with Plato, to imply with Aristotle, to rage with Demosthenes,
or to persuade with Tully”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>&mdash;in other words, they followed
the ordinary course of studies provided in the Roman schools. Even
when these disappeared, the episcopal and monastic schools continued
to preserve some knowledge of letters. The multiplication
of monasteries, even before the arrival of the Benedictines in 543,
had progressed with extraordinary rapidity. We read of one bishop
establishing forty communities in his own diocese; and during the
century that succeeded the first foundation made by St. Maurus, as
many as 238 Benedictine monasteries are known to have arisen in
different provinces of Gaul. It is probable that most of these
monasteries, to whatever rule they belonged, possessed a school.
The monastic rules which sprung up previous to the arrival of St.
Maurus&mdash;such as those established by St. Martin, St. Eugendus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
St. Yrieix, and St. Columbanus&mdash;all enjoined study and the transcription
of books, as well as manual labour. Nor can it be doubted
that secular as well as religious pupils were received in the monastic
schools, and that the education given was not exclusively ecclesiastical.
It even appears as though the Gallo-Roman nobility of this
period were more solicitous to give their sons a liberal education
than their chivalric descendants of six centuries’ later date. I will
give but two examples. At the monastery of Condat it is expressly
stated that noble secular youths were educated in all the learning of
the times; and what this term implies is explained in the life of
St. Eugendus, who received his entire training there, and never once
left the monastery from his seventh to his sixtieth year. He was
as familiar with the Greek as with the Latin orators, says his biographer,
and was besides a great promoter of sacred studies. The
other example is even more to the point, as showing up to what age
secular youths were then expected to continue students. St. Aicard
received his education in the monastic school of Soissons, about the
middle of the seventh century, and remained there until his seventeenth
year, when he was summoned home by his father to be introduced
at court and to commence his military career&mdash;a career, be it
remembered, into which the aspirant to chivalry in the twelfth
century would have been initiated at seven. He afterwards embraced
the religious state, and did much to improve the studies in his
monastery of Jumièges. Then there were the episcopal schools, in
which the learning given was far from being superficial. St. Gregory
of Tours tells us that when King Guntram entered Orleans in 540
he was met by a band of scholars from the bishop’s school, who
welcomed him in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac verses of their
own composition. St. Gregory had himself received his education
in the episcopal schools of Clermont and Vienne, and informs us
that even ecclesiastical students, before entering on their sacred
studies, went through a course of the seven liberal arts, together with
one of poetry and the Cantus.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> M. Guizot gives a list of the principal
monastic and episcopal schools of which a distant notice is to
be found in the histories of the seventh century. Twenty of them
are in Neustria alone, and their multiplication forms the subject
of repeated decrees of provincial councils.</p>

<p>We need not, however, dwell on their history more particularly,
for whatever may have been their number or their excellence, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
certain that before the accession of Charlemagne, the Gallican
schools had fallen into general decay. The decline was progressive,
but it ended in something like total extinction. “At the end of the
fourth century,” says M. Guizot, “profane and sacred literature
flourished side by side: pagan letters were indeed dying, but they
were not entirely dead. They soon, however, disappeared, and
sacred literature alone was cultivated. But if we go on a little
further, we find that the cultivation of Christian literature has itself
vanished,”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>&mdash;the decay had, in fact, become universal.</p>

<p>Tennemann, in his history of philosophy, does not hesitate to
attribute this deplorable state of things to the tyranny of the Church,
and the triumph of the principle of faith and authority over that of
liberty and reason. But from the sixth to the eighth century, the
ecclesiastical powers in Gaul had not the strength to exercise
tyranny, even had they possessed the will. The slightest acquaintance
with the history of those centuries and their horrible social disorders
will suffice to show that submission to the principle of Church
authority had not at that time assumed any very alarming proportions
north of the Alps. The Church of Gaul was torn with petty
schisms, and disgraced by scandals arising mainly from the absence
of any authority at all strong enough to repress them, and the
supremacy of the Holy See had to be firmly re-asserted by St.
Boniface before any adequate remedy of these disorders could be
applied. The intellectual sterility of this epoch may rather be
traced to the want of that principle, than to its excess; it was in
fact an unavoidable result of the anarchy and dissolution of all
social ties which followed on the fall of the Roman Empire. Had
ecclesiastical discipline been preserved, we might yet at least have
found the theological studies flourishing; but what could be expected
from bishops who had either simoniacally obtained their dignities,
or had been appointed by barbarian rulers from the ranks of their
own soldiers or courtiers? Destitute themselves of all knowledge of
sacred letters, they were not likely to cherish them in others; and
in many cases they held their sees as baronies might be held by lay
proprietors. The incessant civil commotions that prevailed perpetuated
the reign of darkness, for, as the writer just quoted remarks,
when the state of society becomes rude and difficult, studies necessarily
languish. “The taste for truth and the appreciation of the
beautiful are delicate plants, needing a pure sky and a kindly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
atmosphere:&mdash;in the midst of storms they droop their heads and
perish.” So far from the Church being held answerable for the
decay of literature, it was she alone that provided it any asylum
in those dismal times, and it was in her monastic houses that
learning, “proscribed and beaten down by the tempest that raged
around, took refuge under the shelter of the altar, till happier times
should suffer it to reappear in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The dawn of a better state of things began to show itself under
the rule of Pepin. That monarch appears to have contemplated
something of the same plan of reform afterwards carried out by the
vaster genius of his son. His first step was to renew those close
relations with the Holy See, the interruption of which had so largely
contributed to disorganise the Church of France. In 747, being
then mayor of the palace, he despatched an embassy to Pope
Zachary, imploring his assistance and advice in the reformation of
the episcopal order. It has been shown in the foregoing chapter,
that a similar reformation had been set on foot in Austrasia by his
brother Carloman, where, by the assistance of St. Boniface acting as
apostolic vicar, the bishops and secular clergy had solemnly engaged
to observe the ecclesiastical canons, and the abbots, to receive the
rule of St. Benedict. The subsequent change of dynasty was
affected by the will, it is true, of the Frankish people, but not until
it had received the sanction of the Pope, who decided that he who
held the power of king should likewise assume the royal title. This
appeal of the Franks to the authority of the Holy See in the election
of their sovereign is a fact of immense political importance, and from
that hour the tide of barbarism began to ebb. The councils held
under Pepin ceased not to labour at the correction of abuses; and
the journey of Pope Stephen III. into France in 748, if it exhibits
him on one hand as a fugitive from the Lombards, displays him to
us no less as receiving from kings and people the homage due to
him as Father of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Together with the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline and the
legitimate authority of the Holy See, appear the first indications of
an approaching revival of learning. One of the ambassadors despatched
by Pepin to conduct the Pope into France was Chrodegang,
Bishop of Metz, a German by birth, and learned for the times in
which he lived. In 762 he had done his best to restore discipline
and letters in his own diocese, by establishing canonical life among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
his cathedral clergy, and giving them a rule in which provision was
made for the maintenance of the episcopal seminary. Previously to
this he had founded several monasteries, with the view of promoting
sacred studies, among others the great abbey of Gorze, the school of
which became afterwards so famous. At the same time Pepin was
directing his attention to the correction of the liturgical books. He
obtained from Pope Stephen an Antiphonary and Responsory, together
with copies of the works of St. Denys, the dialectics of Aristotle,
some treatises on geometry and orthography, and a grammar.
The movement was inaugurated by an attempted reform in the
ecclesiastical chant. During the stay of Pope Stephen at the
Frankish court, Pepin was struck by the majesty of the Roman
tones, and entreated that some of the Papal singers might instruct
the choristers of his own chapel. Simeon, the Pope’s chapel-master,
therefore remained in France, and gave lessons there for some years;
but the reform thus effected was only partial, and was not finally
established in Charlemagne’s time without a struggle.</p>

<p>Pepin’s further plans were cut short by his death, which took place
in 768, and was followed in 771 by that of his son Carloman, Charlemagne,
the surviving son of Pepin, being thus left master of all the
Frankish territories. We need not follow the course of his conquests,
which gradually extended the boundaries of his empire, from
the shores of the Baltic to the banks of the Ebro, and from the
Danube to the Atlantic Ocean. During the forty-six years that he
ruled the destinies of Europe, he was engaged in incessant wars,
which seemed to leave little leisure for literary pursuits, and was
organising a vast political system which, even in peaceable times,
would have demanded the undivided attention of any ordinary
sovereign. But if there ever was a man who by his mere natural
endowments soared above other men, it was Charlemagne. His life,
like his stature, was colossal. Time never seemed wanting to him
for anything that he willed to accomplish, and during his ten years
campaign against the Saxons and Lombards, he contrived to get
leisure enough to study grammar, and render himself tolerably proficient
as a Latin writer in prose and verse. He found his tutors in
the cities that he conquered. When he became master of Pisa, he
gained the services of Peter of Pisa, whom he set over the Palatine
school, which had existed even under the Merovingian kings, though
as yet it was far from enjoying the fame to which it was afterwards
raised by the teaching of Alcuin. He possessed the art of turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
enemies into friends, and thus drew to his court the famous historian,
Paul Warnefrid, deacon of the Church of Rome, who had previously
acted as secretary to Didier, king of the Lombards. When Charlemagne
set the crown of Lombardy on his own head, in 744, Paul
resisted the new order of things, and made three attempts to restore
his country’s independence. The Frankish judges condemned him
to lose his eyes and his hands, but Charlemagne interfered. “We
shall not easily find another hand that can write history,” he said, and
Paul, conquered by his generosity, went back with him to France,
and accepted the charge of teaching Greek to the young princess
Richtrude, who had been affianced to the Greek emperor, Constantine.
The Lombard scholar appeared nothing less than a prodigy
in the eyes of the Frankish courtiers, and Peter of Pisa poured
out his admiration in a poetical epistle, in which he calls him, “in
Greek, a Homer; in Latin, a Virgil; in Hebrew, another Philo.” It
speaks well for the real scholarship of Paul that he declined swallowing
all the flattery conveyed in this pompous address, and plainly
stated in his reply that though he could read Greek, he could not
speak it, and that he knew no more of Hebrew than a few words he
had picked up at school. As to his being a second Homer or Virgil,
he seems to have considered the insinuation anything but a compliment,
and declared rather bluntly that he wished to have nothing
in common with two heathens. He was afterwards employed in
establishing the schools of Metz, and finally became a monk at
Monte Cassino, where he wrote his life of St. Gregory the Great,
and the well-known hymn “Ut queant laxis.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Another Italian scholar, St. Paulinus, of Aquileja, was coaxed into
the service of the Frankish sovereign after his conquest of Friuli; I
will not say that he was <em>bought</em>, but he was certainly paid for by a
large grant of confiscated territory made over by diploma to “the
Venerable Paulinus, master of the art of grammar.” But none of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
these learned personages were destined to take so large a part in that
revival of learning which made the glory of Charlemagne’s reign, as
our own countryman Alcuin. It was in 781, on occasion of the
king’s second visit to Italy, that the meeting took place at Parma,
the result of which was to fix the English scholar at the Frankish
court. Having obtained the consent of his own bishop and sovereign
to this arrangement, Alcuin came over to France in 782, bringing
with him several of the best scholars of York, among whom were
Wizo, Fredegis, and Sigulf. Charlemagne received him with joy, and
assigned him three abbeys for the maintenance of himself and his
disciples, those namely, of Ferrières, St. Lupus of Troyes, and St.
Josse in Ponthieu. From this time Alcuin held the first place in the
literary society that surrounded the Frankish sovereign, and filled an
office the duties of which were as vast as they were various. Three
great works at once claimed his attention, the correction of the
liturgical books, the direction of the court academy, and the establishment
of other public schools throughout the empire. Alcuin began
with the task first on the list, for until the books at his command
were themselves rendered readable, it was of small avail to talk of
opening schools. In the hands of ignorant copyists the text of Scripture
had become so corrupt as to be hardly intelligible. The Book
of Gospels and Epistles for Sundays and festivals was first corrected,
and such a system of punctuation and accentuation adopted as might
enable even the unlearned to read them without making any gross
error. The more arduous undertaking of correcting the whole Bible
was not completed till the year 800, when on the occasion of Charlemagne’s
coronation at Rome as Emperor of the West, Alcuin forwarded
to him, as the best present he could offer, a copy of the sacred
volume, carefully freed from error.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>But it was as head of the Palatine school that Alcuin’s influence
was chiefly to be felt in the restoration of letters. Charlemagne
presented himself as his first pupil, together with the three princes,
Pepin, Charles, and Louis, his sister Gisla and his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Richtrude, his councillors Adalard and Angilbert, and Eginhard his
secretary. Such illustrious scholars soon found plenty to imitate
their example, and Alcuin saw himself called on to lecture daily to a
goodly crowd of bishops, nobles, and courtiers. The king wished to
transform his court into a new Athens preferable to that of ancient
Greece, in so far as the doctrine of Christ is to be preferred to that
of Plato. All the liberal arts were to be taught there, but in such a
way as that each should bear reference to religion, for this was
regarded as the final end of all learning. Grammar was studied in
order better to understand the Holy Scriptures and to transcribe
them more correctly; music, to which much attention was given,
was chiefly confined to the ecclesiastical chant; and it was principally
to explain the Fathers and refute errors contrary to the faith
that rhetoric and dialectics were studied. “In short,” says Crevier,
“the thought both of the king and of the scholar who laboured with
him was to refer all things to religion, nothing being considered as
truly useful which did not bear some relation to that end.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>At first Alcuin allowed the study of the classic poets, and in his
boyhood, as we know, he had been a greater reader of Virgil than
of the Scriptures. His writings evince a perfect familiarity with the
ancient poets and philosophers, whom he continually quotes, and
though in his old age he discouraged his monastic pupils from
following this study, it is certain that he allowed and even advocated
it while presiding over the Palatine school. This appears from one
of his familiar epistles to Charlemagne, in which he gives a lively
picture of the labours carried on there by the students and their
masters. One he describes as teaching the lectors of the royal
chapel to read without misplacing their accents; another is training
the boys in sacred chant; Eginhard, who is pronounced “learned in
prosody,” seems to have been idling his time, but Gisla had been
contemplating the stars in the silent night. “<em>But what crime</em>,” he
continues, “<em>has harmonious Virgil committed? Is not the father of
poets worthy of finding a master who shall teach the children of the
palace to admire his verse?</em>” And he concludes with the hope that
two, whom he names Thyrsis and Menalcas, may long survive to
keep the cooks in order, and supply the writer with large goblets of
Greek wine, and smoking dishes.</p>

<p>In this little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu-d’esprit</i> we see, in the midst of its playful
allusions to their familiar intercourse, what was the serious work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the Palatine scholars, and when Alcuin thus wrote he was certainly
far from entertaining those severe views regarding classical studies
which are generally attributed to him. It is true that at a later
period he endeavoured to dissuade his disciple, Sigulf, from studying
what he called, “the impure eloquence of Virgil,” telling him that
the Sacred Scriptures should be enough for him. He also rebuked
Rigbod, Archbishop of Mentz, for carrying Virgil in his bosom, and
wished he would carry in its place the Book of the Gospels; but it
is probable that most ecclesiastics would think with him that an
archbishop might spend his time more profitably over the Gospels
than over the Æneid. Sigulf did not certainly feel himself obliged
literally to carry out the advice of his master, for in the school of
Ferrières, which he afterwards governed, the Latin poets were very
generally studied. He established such a classical taste among his
scholars, that in the next reign we find Lupus of Ferrières correcting
the works of Pliny, and sending to Rome copies of Suetonius and
Quintus Curtius. It is clear, therefore, that the classics were not
absolutely excluded from Alcuin’s system of education, though in the
main Crevier’s account must be allowed to be correct, and gives a
fair statement of the views that prevailed during the whole of the
monastic period. The authors whose study Charlemagne and Alcuin
desired to promote, were not so much Virgil and Cicero, as St.
Jerome and St. Augustine; and Charlemagne, in his excessive admiration
of those Fathers, gave utterance to the wish that he had a
dozen such men at his court. The <cite>City of God</cite> was read at the
royal table, and the questions addressed by the court students to their
master turned rather on the obscurities of Holy Writ than the difficulties
of prosody. In one thing, however, they betrayed a classic
taste, and that was in their selection of names. The Royal Academicians
all rejoiced in some literary soubriquet; Alcuin was Flaccus;
Angilbert, Homer; but Charlemagne himself adopted the more
scriptural appellation of David.</p>

<p>The eagerness with which this extraordinary man applied himself
to acquire learning for himself, and to extend it throughout his
dominions, is truly admirable, when we remember the enormous
labours in which he was constantly engaged. Hincmar, Bishop of
Rheims, has left us an interesting account of the business of all
kinds which he every day personally investigated. Yet, while the
“King of Europe,” as he was fitly called, was regulating with his
own hands the affairs of a mighty empire, he was patiently pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
a course of studies which might have befitted a university student.
He spoke and wrote Latin with facility, and read Greek well,
though he was not equally successful in speaking it. He had some
knowledge of Syriac, and towards the end of his life corrected a
Latin copy of the Gospels, after comparing it with the Greek and
Syriac text. He studied all the liberal arts under Alcuin, and was a
true German in his love of music. He completed the reform of the
Church chant, which his father had attempted, an undertaking
rendered somewhat difficult by the obstinacy of his own singers.
It was during the Easter festival of 787, that Charlemagne, being
then at Rome, was called on to decide a dispute which had broken
out between the Gallican and Roman chanters. The Gallicans
maintained that their tones were the most beautiful, whilst the
Romans appealed to the teaching of St. Gregory, which had been
jealously preserved in his school, but which, as they affirmed, the
Gallicans had corrupted. The dispute grew warm, for whilst the
fiery Franks, trusting in the king’s protection, loaded their opponents
with abusive epithets, the more refined Romans took refuge in
sarcasm, and affected to pity the rusticity of such ignorant barbarians.
Charlemagne listened to what both parties had to say, and
then addressed his own chanters. “Tell me,” he said, “where is
the stream the purest, at its source or in its channel?” “In its
source, of course,” was the reply. “Well, then,” said the king, “do
you return to the source, for by your own showing, the corruption
lies with you.” This was an argument <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad hominem</i>, and the crestfallen
Franks were fain to own themselves vanquished. To set the
question at rest for ever, Charlemagne requested Pope Adrian to
give him two chanters from the Gregorian school, and an authentic
copy of the Roman Antiphonary, which Adrian had himself noted
according to the system then established at Rome. The two chanters,
Theodore and Benedict, accordingly accompanied the king back to
France, and were employed to teach the correct chant; and to purge
the Gallican Antiphonaries of their corruptions, Charlemagne established
two schools of music, one at Metz, for Austrasia, and the
other at Soissons, for Neustria, which were each presided over by
one of the Roman teachers; all choir masters were commanded to
resort thither and study under their direction, and to send in their
books for correction, which, up to that time, says the monk of
Angoulême, every one had spoiled after his own fancy.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>John the Deacon, who wrote in the following century, and who
evidently exceedingly relished the defeat of the Gallicans, introduces
the whole story of the dispute into his life of St. Gregory.
He observes that the Frankish organs were unable to express
certain tremblings and delicacies of the Italian chant. “The barbarous
harshness of their cracked throats,” he says, “when, by
inflections and reverberations, they endeavoured to emit a gentle
psalmody, out of a certain natural hoarseness sent forth grating
sounds like that of carts on a high road; and thus, instead of
delighting the souls of their hearers, their singing, on the contrary,
rather troubled them, by provoking distractions.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This is bad
enough; but the Monk of Angoulême would have us know that it
was not merely through their ears that the Frankish congregations
had to suffer distractions. The sore distress which one inexperienced
singer endured in his attempt to produce the required “tremblings”
must certainly have severely tried the self-command of those who
witnessed it. “It chanced,” says the historian, “that a certain
clerk, ignorant of the accustomed rules, was called on to figure in
the royal chapel, when, agitating his head in a circular manner, and
opening an enormous mouth, he painfully endeavoured to imitate
those around him.” The choir, of course, was in a suppressed titter,
but Charlemagne, without betraying the slightest token of annoyance
or ridicule, called the unfortunate performer to him after the office
was over, and rewarded his good-will with a handsome present.
This great king often assisted at matins, and indicated with his hand
the clerk who was to sing the lessons, or responsory. It is also said
that he used to mark the end of the motetts with a certain guttural
sound (a <em>grunt</em>, his historian calls it), which became the diapason for
the recommencement of the phrase. The use of organs began to
be introduced during his reign, and Walafrid Strabo tells us of a
woman who died of the ecstacy occasioned by first hearing one of
these instruments.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly asserted that Charlemagne, with all his
learning, never knew how to write. The supposition rests on the
words of his secretary, Eginhard, who says, “He tried to write, and
constantly carried little tablets about him, that in his leisure moments
he might accustom his hand to the drawing (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">effigiendis</i>) of letters, but
he succeeded badly, having applied himself to the art too late.”
Even if this passage is to be understood of the use of pen and ink,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
it only informs us that the emperor wrote a schoolboy’s scrawl, a
circumstance not altogether without a parallel in the history of great
men. But the expression of <em>drawing</em> or <em>delineating</em> letters seems
rather to apply to the art of illumination and <em>ornamental writing</em>,
which properly forms the art of caligraphy: and this explanation
derives additional support from the fact that Charlemagne was a
passionate admirer of painting, and caused innumerable manuscripts
to be adorned with miniatures and ornaments, many of which are
still preserved, the portrait of the emperor being often introduced.
His very camp oratory was painted, and one of the offices of the
envoys, whom he sent at stated periods through his dominions, was
to inspect and report on the state of the paintings in the churches.
His warlike hand very probably wielded the sword with more
address than the pen, and, it may easily be believed, made sad
results with the paint-brush, but that he knew how to write is sufficiently
proved by the copy of the Gospels corrected by his hand,
after he had compared it with the Greek and Syriac text, which is
still preserved at Vienna, and by the direct testimony of Hincmar.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>This prelate, in his account of the Council of Nismes, remarks:
“We have often heard the courtiers of King Charles say that this
prince, who excelled all the other kings of France in knowledge of
the Scriptures and of the civil and ecclesiastical law, always had at
his bed’s head <em>tablets and pens</em>, to note down, whether by day or
night, any thoughts that occurred to him that might be useful to
Church or State.” He also presented to the Church of Strasburg a
Psalter, in which his name was written with his own hand;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and it
is to be presumed that he himself transcribed his numerous letters
to Alcuin. Among the works of that scholar we find thirty letters
addressed to the king, containing answers to his questions on theological
and scientific subjects. These letters show that Alcuin had
no easy task in satistying the intellectual requirements of a man who
thought of everything, and busied himself equally with history,
chronology, morals, astronomy, grammar, theology, and law. He
took a very special delight in the study of astronomy, and on serene
nights was fond of observing the stars from the roof of his palace.
In the year 798 considerable anxiety was felt both by the king and
his academicians, in consequence of the erratic movements of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
planet Mars, whose disappearance for a whole year it passed their
powers to account for. Alcuin was written to, and entreated to
explain the phenomenon, and his reply shows that he had tested the
statements found in his books by careful astronomical observations.
“What has now happened to Mars,” he says, “is frequently observed
of all the other planets, viz., that they remain longer under the
horizon than is stated in the books of the ancients. The rising and
setting of the stars vary from the observations of those who live in
the southern and eastern parts of the world, where the masters
chiefly flourished who have set forth the laws of the universe.”
From these words it may be gathered that Alcuin was acquainted
with the globular form of the earth, and comprehended the phenomena
depending on it. Charlemagne had some claims to the reputation
of a poet, and nine pieces of Latin poetry from his pen are
printed in his works, which are given in the collection of the Abbé
Migne.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> One of these was an epitaph on his friend Pope Adrian I.,
which he desired to have placed over the tomb of that pontiff, and
caused it therefore to be engraved in letters of gold on a marble
tablet, and sent to Rome. These verses, thirty-eight in number, have
attained a singular kind of immortality. The tablet has been preserved
in the portico of St. Peter’s Basilica, where it may still be
seen by the pious visitor, together with another inscription containing
the ancient grant from Pope Gregory II. of a wood of olives to supply
the oil for the lamps burning round the Apostle’s tomb. All ancient
writers are unanimous in declaring these verses to have been the
genuine composition of the emperor, and not of Alcuin, as some
pretend. They bear the title, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epitaphium Adriani I., Papæ, quo
Carolus Magnus sepulchrum ipsius decoravit</i>.</p>

<p>But one of the most interesting features in Charlemagne’s intellectual
labours was the attempt he made to perfect his native
language, and give it a grammatical form. He began the composition
of a German grammar, which was afterwards continued by
Raban Maur; the other Palatine scholars joined him in the task,
and assigned to the months and days of the week the names which
they still bear in German. In pursuance of the same design, the
emperor made a collection of old Tudesque songs, some of which
he took down from the lips of his soldiers; but after his death Louis
the Debonnaire found the manuscript, and perceiving the names of
Scandinavian deities, with little appreciation of the importance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
work on which his great father had been engaged, tossed it into the
fire. There was nothing which Charlemagne had more at heart than
the completion of this undertaking, and he was accustomed to say
that he hoped to see the day when the laws should be written in the
Frankish tongue, comparing the shutting them up in a language of
which the common people were ignorant to the conduct of Caligula,
who caused his edicts to be written in illegible characters, and placed
out of sight, that the people might unconsciously break them and so
incur sentence of death. Alcuin no doubt assisted in this work,
which was one that ever found favour with the English monks.
Even before leaving his native country he is said to have made an
Anglo-Saxon version of the Pentateuch, which was preserved and
used so late as the twelfth century; and he would naturally be disposed
to enter into the king’s designs, and specially to provide for
the religious instruction of the people in their own language. Something
in this direction had already been done in Germany by the
followers of St. Boniface; and early in the eighth century we find
formulas of confession, brief confessions of faith, and portions of
psalms and hymns translated for popular use into the rude Tudesque
dialect. Some of the early German hymns appear to have been
written by the monks of St. Gall, and were used as valuable means
of instructing the people in the elements of religion. Specimens of
these are given by Noth in his history of the German language, and
among them is a fragment of the 138th Psalm. It will of course be
borne in mind that the language spoken by the people of Germany
was essentially the same as that of the English missionaries, who thus
possessed peculiar facilities in preaching and instructing their converts.
Thus the form of abjuration and the confession of faith drawn
up by St. Boniface and his followers, for the use of their German
catechumens, is equally akin to the Anglo-Saxon and to the
Tudesque idioms:&mdash;“Forsachister Diabolæ? Ec forsachs Diabolæ.
Gelobistu in Got Almehtigan, Fadaer? Ec Gelobo in Got, Almehtigan
Fadaer. Gelobistu in Crist, Godes suno? Gelobistu in Halsgan Gast?”
And when we speak of Charlemagne as cultivating the Tudesque
or old German dialect, it will also be remembered that the Franks were
a German race, and that what we now call <em>French</em> is not formed from
their language, but from the Romanesque, or corrupt Latin, which
prevailed in the southern provinces of Gaul, as well as in Spain and
the north of Italy. As in course of time the Gallo-Roman element
prevailed in France, the Romance language became universally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
used, while the Tudesque remained, as before, the language
of the Germans. Hence Verstigan was not dealing in paradox
when he asserted that in old times the English people all talked
French, the Frankish and Saxon dialects being substantially the same
language.</p>

<p>The graver studies of the Palatine scholars were enlivened, after
the fashion of the Anglo Saxon schools, by dialogues, in which
enigmas and a play of words are introduced in tiresome profusion.
A curious fragment exists bearing the title of a disputation between
Alcuin and Pepin, wherein the wits of the pupil are stimulated by
the questions of the master. These exercises, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad acuendos pueros</i>,
as they were called, were much used by the English teachers, and
specimens of a similar description are to be found which appear to
have been used so late as the fourteenth century. “What is writing?”
asks Alcuin. “The keeper of history.” “What is speaking?”
“The interpreter of the soul.” “What is the liberty of man?”
“Innocence.” “What is the day?” “The call to labour.” “What
is the sun?” “The splendour of the universe.” “What is winter?”
“The exile of spring.” “What is spring?” “The painter of the
earth.” Alcuin says, “I saw <ins class="corr" id="tn127" title="Transcriber’s Note—“the other day a man stanning” changed to “the other day a man standing”.">the other day a man standing</ins>, a dead
man walking, a man walking who had never breathed.” Pepin.
“How can that have been? explain yourself.” Alcuin. “It was
my image reflected in the water.” Pepin. “How could I fail to
understand you? I have often seen the same thing.”</p>

<p>In his letters to the young princes Alcuin freely points out their
faults, and gives them excellent advice. “Seek,” he writes, “to adorn
your noble rank with noble deeds; let humility be in your heart,
and truth on your lips; and let your life be a pattern of integrity,
that so God may be pleased to prosper your days.” The court
school, however, was not intended exclusively for princes and
nobles; children of an inferior rank were also admitted, in order to
receive such an education as might hereafter fit them to fill various
offices in church and state. Charlemagne took this charge on himself,
and afterwards promoted his scholars according to their merits
and ability. We learn this from the following charming narrative
related by the Monk of St. Gall.</p>

<p>“The glorious King Charles,” he says, “returning into Gaul after a
prolonged absence, ordered that all the children whom he caused to
be educated should be brought before him, that they might present
him their compositions in prose and verse. Those of an inferior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and obscure rank had succeeded best, whereas the sons of the nobles
brought nothing of any value. Then the wise prince, separating the
good scholars from the negligent ones, and putting the first on his
right hand, said to them, ‘My children, you may rely on my friendship
and protection, since you have done your best to execute my
orders, and have worked hard according to the best of your abilities.
Try to do yet better, and depend upon it you will receive the most
honourable offices I have to give, and that you will always be
precious in my eyes.’ Then turning to those on his left hand; ‘As
to you,’ he said, ‘born of noble blood, and children of the first
houses in my kingdom, vainly confident in your birth and riches you
have neglected to obey my orders, and have preferred play and idleness
to study, which is the proper glory of your age. But I swear to
you, your noble birth shall find no consideration from me; and if
you do not make up for your indolence by earnest study, you will
obtain no favour from Charles.’”</p>

<p>Some writers, and among them M. Ampère, have considered that
after all that has been said and written about the Palatine school, there
was in reality no school, but only a literary academy. The probability
is that there was both a school and an academy, and that the
two institutions, though not identical, were directed by the same
masters. According to this view, the Palatine <em>Academy</em> was formed
of the friends and courtiers of Charlemagne, while the <em>School</em> was for
the education of youths, chiefly, if not exclusively, intended for the
ecclesiastical state, and chosen from all ranks, noble and simple.
The Monk of St. Gall is decisive on this last point, and mentions
two scholars, the sons of millers, who, after leaving the emperor’s
school, in which they do not seem greatly to have distinguished
themselves, obtained admission into the monastery of Bobbio. The
proofs of the actual existence of this school are in fact too overwhelming
to admit of a doubt. M. Ampère appears to have been
staggered at the notion of a crowd of schoolboys accompanying the
emperor wherever he sojourned. However strange and inconvenient
such a system appears to our notions, the historical evidence is very
strong in proof that it really existed. In the life of St. Adalard,
there are allusions to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turba clericorum palatii</i>. Alcuin in his
letters complains not a little of the fatigue occasioned by this constant
journeying. And we know that Otho the Great, whose revival
of a Palatine school was undertaken in avowed imitation of Charlemagne,
always required his scholars to accompany him; and that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
brother Bruno, who superintended their studies, followed the court,
and carried his books with him.</p>

<p>It was then, as we must believe, a real school over which Alcuin
presided, and most French writers claim it as the germ of the
university of Paris. The court of the Frankish monarch was indeed
fixed, not at Paris, but at Aix-la-Chapelle, but it seems to have been
removed to Paris in the reign of Charles the Bald, and there the
Palatine school continued to flourish under a succession of famous
masters, and possibly formed the nucleus of that great institution
which fills so large a place in the history of education.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his scholastic labours did not so occupy the time of
Alcuin, as to hinder him from devoting himself to the correction of
manuscripts, and the multiplication of books went on apace. A
staff of skilful copyists was gradually formed, and so soon as any
work had been revised by Alcuin and his fellow labourers, it was
delivered over to the hands of the monastic scribes. Particular
abbeys, as that of Fontanelles, acquired renown for the extraordinary
accuracy of their transcribers, and the beauty of their writing. At
Rheims and Corby, also, the monks greatly excelled, and laying
aside the corrupt character which had till then been in use, they
adopted the smaller Roman letters. Rules were made forbidding
any man to be employed as a copyist who had not the knowledge of
grammar requisite for enabling him to avoid errors; and treatises on
orthography and punctuation were drawn up by Alcuin for the special
use of his scribes. Libraries were gradually collected in all the
principal monasteries, including the chief works of the Fathers and
the Latin classics. In the library of St. Riquier, of which abbey
Angilbert became superior, we find a few years later copies of
Homer, Virgil, and Cicero; in that of Rheims, Cæsar, Livy, and
Lucan; Dijon possessed a Horace, and at Montierendes there were
the works of Cicero and Terence. The text of the last-named author
was revised and corrected by Alcuin himself, a fact which confirms
what has been before said of his toleration of the poets. From this time
the transcription of books came to be regarded as one of the ordinary
branches of monastic manual work, in a great degree taking the place
of that agricultural labour on which, in earlier ages, the monks were
so generally employed. The real hard work of head, eyes, and hand,
which it involved, was pithily expressed in the well-known couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tres digiti scribunt, totum corpusque laborat,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If the hope of gain stimulated those outside to follow it as a trade,
more spiritual motives were laid before the children of the cloister.
As a work of charity done for the love of God and man, it was
promised an eternal reward, and the persevering toils of a long life
were, it was thought, capable of being offered as an acceptable work
of penance. Meanwhile, the spirit of improvement was diffusing
itself from the court through the whole country. The Capitulars of
Charlemagne&mdash;so called because arranged in heads, or chapters&mdash;included
amongst various laws for the regulation of the civil government
others which regarded the encouragement of learning. A
circular letter addressed by Charlemagne on his return from Rome
in 787 to all the bishops and abbots of the kingdom, after thanking
them for their letters and pious prayers, proceeded to criticise the
grammar in which these had been expressed. “They who endeavour
to please God by a good life,” writes the king, “should not neglect
to please Him by correct phraseology, and it is well that monasteries
and episcopal seminaries should pay attention to literature as well
as to the practices of religion. It is better indeed to lead a good
life than to become learned; nevertheless knowledge precedes action.
Each one, then, should understand what he is about, and the mind
better comprehends its duty when the tongue in praising God is free
from mistakes of language.” The writer then goes on to notice that
the excellent sentiments of his clergy had been expressed in a rude
and uncouth style; they had been inspired by true devotion, but the
tongue had failed for want of culture. “But if errors in words are
dangerous, much more so are errors in their signification. We exhort
you therefore that you fail not to cultivate learning with the humble
intention of pleasing God, so as more surely to penetrate the mysteries
of the Holy Scriptures. We wish, in short, to see you what the
soldiers of Christ ought to be&mdash;devout in heart, learned in intercourse
with the world, chaste in life, and scholars in conversation&mdash;so that
all who approach you may be as much enlightened by your wisdom
as they are edified by your holy life.” This was not allowed to remain
an empty recommendation; it was followed by ordinances for reviving
the old monastic and cathedral schools, and for founding other
public schools, the establishment of which forms the most important
feature in Charlemagne’s revival of learning. In the Benedictine
monasteries two kinds of schools had always existed, or been supposed
to exist&mdash;the greater and the less. In the minor schools, according
to Trithemius, were taught “the Catholic faith and prayers, grammar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
church music, the psalter, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Computum</i>, or method of calculating
Easter,” while in the major schools the liberal sciences were
also taught. In the Capitular of Aix-la-Chapelle, published in 789,
Charlemagne required that minor schools should be attached to all
monasteries and cathedral churches without exception, and that
children of all ranks, both noble and servile, should be received into
them. At the same time the larger and more important monasteries
were to open major schools, in which mathematics, astronomy,
arithmetic, geography, music, rhetoric, and dialectics were taught;
and these again were of two descriptions.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Some were interior, or
claustral, intended only for the junior monks, while others were
exterior, or public, and intended for pupils as well secular as ecclesiastic.
Some monk, qualified by his learning, was appointed
scholasticus, and if none such were to be found in the community,
it was not an uncommon practice to invite a monk from some other
religious house to take charge of the school. A claustral and an
exterior school often existed attached to the same monastery or
cathedral, governed by separate masters, the scholars of the claustral
school forming part of the community, while those of the exterior
school, though subject to a certain claustral discipline, did not follow
the same religious exercises. Lay students were received in these
exterior schools, and that far more extensively than is commonly
supposed, most popular writers having represented the monastic
schools as exclusively intended for those in training for the religious
life, thus confusing together the interior and exterior schools.
Public schools of this kind were erected at Fulda, St. Gall’s, Tours,
Hirsauge, Hirsfield, Gorze, Fleury, L’Isle Barbe, Fontanelles, and
Ferrières, as well as at many other monasteries and cathedrals, a list
of which is given by Mabillon.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Bulæus, indeed, endeavours to
show that Charlemagne limited the studies of the ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
schools to grammar and sacred learning, and only permitted the
monasteries and episcopal churches to retain the <em>minor</em> schools,
“from the clear view that a variety of sciences, sacred and profane,
is inconsistent with the profession of ascetics.” He even ventures
to put forth the notion that the higher schools were confined to
certain central spots, such as Pavia, Bologna, and Paris. But
Bulæus wrote with an object, which was to magnify his university
at the expense of the monastic schools. We ask ourselves with
surprise where he could have found evidence even for the existence of
any schools at all at Paris and Bologna in the reign of Charlemagne?<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
And as to limiting the monastics to minor schools, it may be safely
affirmed that the idea of limitation of any kind was the very last that
ever suggested itself to the mind of the emperor. As Theodulph of
Orleans says, he did nothing all his life but urge forward his monks
and bishops in the pursuit of learning. During the whole Carlovingian
period the schools of most repute were certainly not those
of Bologna, Paris, and Pavia. They were the episcopal and monastic
schools of Tours, Fulda, Rheims, St. Gall, and Hirsfield, the teachers
of which were all either monks or canons. The ordinance of 789
must be clearly understood, not as forbidding ecclesiastics to study
anything but theology, grammar, and church music, but as rendering
it obligatory on them to study <em>at least</em> so much; whilst, to use the
words of Trithemius, “where temporal means were more abundant,
and by reason of the number of the monks, more likelihood existed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of finding one skilled in the teaching of sacred letters,” the other
liberal arts were also required. The monks of those monasteries in
which the higher studies were not taught travelled to other religious
houses, and studied in their public schools; and we certainly find
no trace, however faint, of the principle that the higher studies were
considered unsuitable to ascetics, for, in point of fact, the ascetics
were all but the only scholars of the age. If lay students were also
to be met with&mdash;and even, as I think we shall see, more frequently
than is ordinarily acknowledged by modern historians&mdash;yet they were
still exceptional cases, and the vast majority of those who studied, as
of those who taught, continued for centuries to be drawn from the
monastic body.</p>

<p>The establishment or revival of the ecclesiastical schools scattered
the seeds of learning broadcast over the Frankish empire. All the
great men whom Charlemagne gathered around him took part in one
way or other in this work. Theodulph, Bishop of Orleans, a Goth
by nation, and an Italian by birth, specially distinguished himself
by his zeal in the establishment of schools throughout his diocese.
He published a Capitular on the duties of priests, in which he
permitted them to send their nephews or other relations to certain
schools in the diocese which were not then regarded as public. He
also enjoined that priests should open schools in villages and rural
districts, “and if any of the faithful should wish to confide their
little ones to him in order to study letters, let him not refuse to
receive and instruct them, but charitably teach them.” This was
to be done gratis, no remuneration being accepted save what might
be willingly offered by the parents. One would gladly know more
of the kind of teaching given in these parochial schools, and specially
how far the children of the peasantry were admitted into them.
That village rustics really went to school and learnt something in the
days of Charlemagne seems, however, past dispute; and among the
Capitulars of the King of Europe we find one which requires the
peasants, as they drive their cattle to pasture and home again, to
<em>sing the canticles of the Church</em>, that all men may recognise them
as Christians. This command obviously implied that the Latin
canticles were well known to the peasantry, and probably the
conning of church hymns and antiphons formed a very large portion
of their school instruction. Theodulph was one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">missi dominici</i>,
or envoys sent by Charlemagne through the provinces of his empire
to inquire into and reform abuses. On his return from one of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
expeditions he published a poem entitled, “An Exhortation to
Judges,” in which he gives a very remarkable account of his progress
through the Narbonnese provinces, and describes the difficulty he
found in resisting the attempts that were made to bribe him. The
proffered bribes were of all kinds&mdash;gold and precious stones,
delicately chased vases&mdash;which, from the classic subjects they
represented, were doubtless relics of ancient Grecian art&mdash;horses,
mules, furs, woollen stuffs, and candles. He refused everything, however,
except food for himself and hay for his horses, and advises
all judges to do in like manner. This was the same Theodulph
whose name is familiar to us as author of the Responsory,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria, laus et honor</i>. Having incurred the displeasure of the
Emperor Louis, he was imprisoned by order of that prince at
Angers; but on Palm Sunday as the emperor passed in the solemn
procession of the day by the bishop’s prison walls, Theodulph sang
from the window the words which he had composed, and thereby
so touched the heart of the Debonnaire monarch that he gave him
his liberty, and caused the same anthem to be thenceforth introduced
into the office of the day, of which it still forms a part.</p>

<p>The name of Theodulph is to be had in remembrance not only as
a founder of schools, but also as a writer of school-books. He felt
compassion for young and tender minds condemned to gather all
their knowledge from the dry and unattractive treatises of Priscian,
and Martian Capella, and hit on a plan of his own for rendering
them a little more popular. He composed in easy Latin verse the
description of a supposed tree of science, which he caused moreover
to be drawn and painted, on the trunk and branches of which
appeared the seven liberal arts. At the foot of the tree sat Grammar,
the basis of all human knowledge holding in her hand a mighty
rod; Philosophy was at the summit: Rhetoric stood on the right
with outstretched hand, and on the left the grave and thoughtful
form of Dialectics; and so of the rest. <ins class="corr" id="tn134" title="Transcriber’s Note—“The whloe was explained in the” changed to “The whole was explained in the”.">The whole was explained in the</ins>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carmina de septem artibus</i>, wherein the good bishop
endeavoured with all his might to scatter the thorny path of learning
with the flowers of imagination. The attempt was at least commendable,
and in so great a scholar it had the gracefulness of condescension,
for Theodulph is reported to have pursued some rare
branches of study, and to have had at least a tincture of Greek
and Hebrew.</p>

<p>Other ministers of Charlemagne are also named as actively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
sharing in the labours of the Renaissance. Smaragdus, abbot of
St. Michael’s, in the diocese of Verdun, and one of the emperor’s
prime councillors, not only established schools in every part of the
diocese, and specially in his own abbey, but wrote a large Latin
grammar for the use of his scholars. The copy which Mabillon saw
preserved in the abbey of Corby bore on the title-page the words:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Christi nomine incipit Grammatici Smaragdi Abbatis mirificus
Tractatus.</i> Then follows a prologue in which the abbot declares
that having, according to his capacity, taught grammar to his monks,
they had been accustomed to transfer the pith of his lectures to their
tablets, that what they took in with their ears they might retain by
dint of frequent reading. And from this they took occasion to
conjure him to write this treatise, which he has done, adorning his
little book with sentences not from Maro or Cicero, but from the
Divine Scriptures, that his readers may at one and the same time
be refreshed with the pleasant drink of the grammatical art and also
of the Word of God. And his reason for doing so has been that
many defend their ignorance by saying that in grammar God is not
named, but only pagan names and examples, and that therefore it
is an art rightly and justly neglected. But he is rather of opinion
that we should do as the Israelites did when they spoiled the
Egyptians, and offer to God the treasures taken from the heathen.
He appears to have devoted some attention to the vulgar dialects,
and gives lists of Frank and Gothic patronymics with their Latin
interpretations.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>St. Benedict of Anian, the cupbearer of Charlemagne, and afterwards
the great reformer of the Benedictine order, was almost as
zealous in restoring studies as in bringing back regular discipline.
“Everywhere,” says his disciple St. Ardo, “he appointed cantors,
taught readers, established grammar-masters, and those skilled in
sacred letters; also he collected a great multitude of books.” Nor
must we omit to notice the labours of Leidrade, the emperor’s
librarian, and one of the “missi dominici,” who, being appointed
Archbishop of Lyons, addressed a curious letter to his imperial
master, in which he describes the result of his various labours. He
has, by God’s grace, established regular psalmody in his church; he
has schools of singers, and schools of readers, who cannot only read
the Scriptures correctly, but who understand the spiritual sense of
the gospels and the prophecies; some even have attained to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
mystical signification of the books of Solomon and of Job. He has
also done what in him lay to promote the copying of books, and has
built, repaired, and decorated an incredible number of churches and
monasteries. Besides these there was Angilbert, the favourite
minister both of Pepin and Charlemagne, who retiring from court
became abbot of St. Riquier and founder of a noble library; and
Adalhard, the emperor’s cousin, created by him count of the royal
palace, who, out of a holy fear of offending God, and losing His
grace in the seductions of a court atmosphere, took refuge in the
abbey of Corby, where he was eventually chosen abbot. In this
capacity he greatly raised the reputation of the Corby schools.
Paschasius, who wrote his life, says that Adalhard was a most
elegant scholar, having been carefully educated in the Palatine
school, and that he was equally eloquent in the Tudesque and
Romanesque dialects as in Latin, and instructed the common people
in their own barbarous tongues. His literary friends gave him the
double surname of Antony Augustine&mdash;Antony from his love of that
saint, and Augustine, because like him he studied to imitate the
virtues of all those around him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alcuin, who had been master to most of these illustrious
men, ceased not to cherish the hope that he might be suffered
to return to his native land. “The searcher of hearts knows,” he
writes, “that I neither came thither, nor do I continue here for the
love of gold, but only for the necessities of the Church.” Like a
true Englishman his heart clung to his old home, to the memory of
his quiet cell at York, where he had studied Horace and Homer,
undisturbed by other sound than the waving of the branches as they
were shaken by the genial morning breeze, a sound which, he says,
did but stir his mind the more to meditation. The flowery meadows
and murmuring streams of England, the smiling garden of his
monastery full of its May apple blossoms or its July roses, and the
abundance of birds singing in the Yorkshire woods, all these find a
place in the sweet verses in which the English exile paints the
beloved scenes in the midst of which he had passed his childish
days;<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and all the brilliancy of Charles’s court could not compensate
to his mind for the loss of home. In 790 he was, therefore,
permitted to revisit England, but two years later he was recalled by
urgent messages from the emperor, who desired that he should
attend the Council of Frankfort held to condemn the heresy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Elipandus. Alcuin felt himself obliged to obey the summons, but
he did not bid farewell to York without testifying the regret with
which he tore himself from its peaceful retirement. “I am yours in
life and in death,” he writes to his brethren, “and it may be that
God will have pity on me, and suffer that you should bury in his old
age, him whom in his infancy you brought up and nourished.”
Charlemagne, however, having regained possession of his favourite
scholar, was not to be induced a second time to give him up; the
utmost that poor Alcuin could obtain was permission to retire from
the court to some monastery within the Frankish dominions. Fulda
was too far distant from the royal residence, and the death of Ithier,
abbot of St. Martin’s of Tours, in 796, enabled the emperor to
appoint Alcuin as his successor.</p>

<p>Tours at that time held the first rank among the religious houses
of France, and what with the task of reforming its discipline and
establishing a first-rate school within its walls, Alcuin enjoyed little
of the leisure after which he yearned. He found himself in fact in
possession of a great abbatial lordship, to which were attached vast
revenues and 20,000 serfs. The revenues were expended by him in
foundations of charity, such as hospitals, which earned for him the
gratitude of the people of Tours. He applied himself to his new
duties with unabated energy, enriched his library with the precious
manuscripts he had brought from York, and by his own teaching
raised the school of Tours to a renown which was shared by none
of its contemporaries. In the hall of studies a distinct place was
set apart for the copyists, who were exhorted by certain verses of
their master, set up in a conspicuous place, to mind their stops,
and not to leave out letters. Here were trained most of those
scholars whom we shall have to notice in the following reigns, such
as Rabanus Maurus, the celebrated abbot of Fulda. A letter
addressed by Alcuin to the emperor soon after his establishment at
Tours gives a somewhat bombastical account of his labours, but the
reader will pardon the pedantry of one who had spent all his life as
a schoolmaster. “The employments of your Flaccus in his retreat,”
he says, “are suited to his humble sphere, but they are neither
inglorious nor unprofitable. I spend my time in the halls of St.
Martin, teaching the noble youths under my care: to some I serve
out the honey of the Holy Scriptures; others I essay to intoxicate
with the wine of ancient literature: one class I nourish with the
apples of grammatical studies, and to the eyes of others I display<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the order of the shining orbs that adorn the azure heavens. To
others again I explain the mysteries contained in the Holy Scriptures,
suiting my instructions to the capacity of my scholars, that I may
train up many to be useful to the Church of God and to be an
ornament to your kingdom. But I am constantly in want of those
excellent books of erudition which I had collected around me in my
own country, both by the devoted zeal of my master Albert and my
own labour. I therefore entreat your majesty to permit me to send
some of my people into Britain that they may bring thence flowers
into France....” After some lengthy praises of the utility of
learning, he proceeds: “Exhort then, my lord the king, the youth
of your palace to learn with all diligence, that they may make such
progress in the bloom of their youth as will bring honour on their
old age. I also, according to my measure, will not cease to scatter
in this soil the seed of wisdom among your servants, remembering
the words, ‘In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold
not thy hand.’ To do this has been the most delightful
employment of my whole life. In my youth I sowed the seeds of
learning in the flourishing seminaries of my native soil. Now in the
evening of my life, though my blood is less warm within me, I do
not cease to do the same in France, praying to God that they may
spring up and flourish in both countries.” In consequence of this
suggestion, a commission was despatched to England for the purpose
of transcribing some of the treasures of the York library. The
French scribes made copies of the English service books, and that
so exactly, that they took no heed of the geographical distinctions of
the two countries, but copied the pontifical of Archbishop Egbert,
and its form for the anointing and coronation of kings, exactly word
for word. Hence in a Rheims pontifical of the ninth century, still
preserved in Cologne cathedral, the emperor of the Franks is
addressed as King of the Saxons, Mercians, and Northumbrians&mdash;a
circumstance which has induced some modern critics to speculate
as to the exact time when the North of England was subject to the
Frankish sceptre. The copies procured through the industry of
these scribes were multiplied at Tours, and thence dispersed throughout
the kingdom. Alcuin’s own works were also in great demand,
specially his elementary treatises on the different sciences. His
other works, which are very numerous, consist chiefly of theological
treatises and commentaries on the Scriptures, some metaphysical
and philosophical writings, and a collection of poems, among which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
are the <cite>Eulogium on the Archbishops and the Church of York</cite>, and the
<cite>Elegy on the Destruction of Lindisfarne</cite>, the latter of which is perhaps
the happiest production of his pen, and evinces the real feeling
of a poet. The news of the sad event which it commemorates
excited consternation throughout Europe, but by none was it received
with bitterer sorrow than by the abbot of Tours. “The man,”
he says, “who can think of that calamity without terror, and who
does not cry to God in behalf of his country, has a heart not of
flesh but of stone.” He at once wrote letters of sympathy to
Ethelred, King of Northumbria, and the monks who had escaped
from the sword, which would be sufficient to evince how fondly his
heart still clung to his native land even without the touching
apostrophe which he introduces to his cell at York. What view
was taken by Alcuin of the work of education, to which his whole
life was devoted may be gathered from his treatise on the seven
liberal arts, the introduction to which is cast in the form of dialogue
between the master and his disciples. I will give an extract which
may suffice to show the noble and elevated sentiments which these
early scholars entertained on the subject of learning:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Dis.</em> “O, wise master, we have often heard you repeat that true
philosophy was the science that taught all the virtues, and the only
earthly riches that never left their possessor in want. Your words
have excited in us a great desire to possess this treasure. We wish
to know where the teaching of philosophy will lead us, and by what
steps we may attain to it. But our age is weak and without your
help we shall not be able to mount these steps.”</p>

<p><em>Master.</em> “It will be easy to show you the way of wisdom, provided
you seek it purely for God’s sake to preserve the purity of
your own soul, and for the love of virtue; if you love it for its own
sake, and do not seek in it any worldly honour and glory or, still
less, riches or pleasure.”</p>

<p><em>Dis.</em> “Master, raise us up from the earth where our ignorance
now detains us, lead us to those heights of science where you passed
your own early years. For if we may listen to the fables of the
poets, they would seem to tell us that the sciences are the true
banquets of the gods.”</p>

<p><em>Master.</em> “We read of Wisdom, which is spoken of by the mouth
of Solomon, that she built herself a house and hewed out seven
pillars. Now, although these pillars represent the seven gifts of
the Holy Ghost and the seven Sacraments of the Church, we may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
also discern in them the <em>seven liberal arts</em>, grammar, rhetoric, dialects,
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, which are like so many
steps on which philosophers expend their labours, and have obtained
the honours of eternal renown.”</p>

<p>As the school of St. Martin rose in celebrity, it became the resort
of a crowd both of foreigners and natives. Alcuin’s own countrymen
in particular flocked around him, and it would seem that the
number of English scholars who constantly arrived, at last excited
the jealousy of the clergy of Tours. One day as four Frankish
priests were standing at the gate of the monastery, a newly arrived
Englishman, Aigulf by name, passed in, and supposing him to be
ignorant of their language, one of them exclaimed, “There goes
another of them! When shall we be free from these swarms of
Britons? They gather round the old fellow like so many bees!”
Aigulf hung his head and blushed; but when Alcuin heard what had
passed he sent for the Frenchmen, and courteously requested them
to sit down, and drink the health of the young scholar in his best
wine. “The old Saxon,” as they called him, ceased not in his retirement
to watch over the interests of learning, even in the remotest
provinces. There was hardly a bishop or abbot of any distinction
who had not at one time or other been his pupil, and he continued
to enjoy and exercise among them the privileged freedom of an old
and honoured master. His letters bear evidence of the immense
range over which his influence extended. In his ninety-fourth epistle
he conjures a young missionary to be always reminding the parish
priests to keep up their schools. Another time he addresses a bishop,
and advises him to return to his own country that he may set in
order good grammar lessons for the children of his diocese. His
fifty-sixth letter is to the English Archbishop of York; and in it he
enters into several useful details; and advises him to have his school
divided into different classes&mdash;one for reading, one for writing, and
one for chanting, so as to preserve good order. Then comes a letter
to the Emperor, reminding him to have the Palatine scholars daily
exercised in their learning; arithmetical subtleties accompany another
letter, and some sage observations on the utility of punctuation,
which commendable branch of grammar has, he regrets to say, been
of late much lost sight of. In short, his active mind, thoroughly
Anglo-Saxon in its temper, worked on to the end; labouring at a
sublime end by homely practical details. One sees he is of
the same race with Bede, who wrote and dictated to the last hour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
of his life, and when his work was finished, calmly closed his book
and died.</p>

<p>It was after the retirement of Alcuin from court, that we must
date the arrival in France of the Irish scholars, Dungal and Clement,
concerning whom the monk of St. Gall relates a story which is treated
as apocryphal by Tiraboschi, though it has found a place in most
earlier histories. He tells us, that having landed on the coast of
France, they excited the curiosity of the people by crying aloud,
“Wisdom to sell! who’ll buy?” The rumour of their arrival reaching
Charlemagne’s ears, he caused them to be brought before him, and
finding them well skilled in letters, retained them both in his service.
Clement remained at Paris and received the direction of the Palatine
school, whilst Dungal was sent to Pavia, where he opened an
academy in the monastery of St. Augustine. Whatever may be
thought of the incident connected with their first appearance in
France, there is no doubt as to their historic identity. Tiraboschi
quotes an edict of the Emperor Lothaire published in 823, for the
re-establishment of public schools in nine of the chief cities of Italy,
from which it appears that Dungal was at the time still presiding
over the school of Pavia. He seems to be the same who, in 811,
addressed a long letter to Charlemagne on the subject of two solar
eclipses, which were expected to take place in the following year,
and may be yet further identified with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dungalus Scotorum
præcipuus</i>, who is noticed in the catalogue of the library of Bobbio,
where he at last retired, bringing with him a great store of books,
which he presented to the monastery. Among them were four books
of Virgil, two of Ovid, one of Lucretius, and a considerable number
of the Greek and Latin fathers.</p>

<p>As to Clement, there is no difficulty in tracing his career. He
seems to have been deeply imbued with the learned mysticism of the
school of Toulouse, and in a treatise on the eight parts of speech,
which is still preserved, quotes the rules of the grammarian Virgil, and
the writings of the noble doctors Glengus, Galbungus, Eneas, and the
rest. Alcuin complained much of the disorder introduced into the
Studies of the court school after his departures. “I left them Latins,”
he exclaimed, “and now I find them Egyptians.” This was a
double hit at the gibberish of the twelve Latinites, which Alcuin
could not abide, and at the hankering which the Irish professors
always displayed, both in science and theology, for the teaching of
the school of Alexandria, many of them having embraced the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
views of the Neo-Platonists. The Egyptians, however, found a
welcome at the court of Charlemagne in spite of their eccentricities;
for there no one was ever coldly received who could calculate
eclipses, or charm the ears of the learned monarch with Latin
hexameters. And it is perhaps to one of these Irish professors that
we must attribute those verses preserved by Martene, and professing
to be written by an “Irish exile,” which contain such agreeable
flattery of the Frankish sovereign and of his people, and which were
presented to the emperor as he held one of those solemn New-year
courts, at which his subjects vied one with another in offering him
jewels, tissues, horses, and bags of money. And perhaps, to his
mind, the graceful lines that celebrated the Frankish people as “a
race of kings come forth from the walls of Troy, into whose hands
God had delivered the empire of the world,” were more acceptable
than even the glittering heaps of the precious metals.</p>

<p>Charlemagne did his utmost to draw Alcuin once more to his side,
and specially pressed him to accompany him on his visit to Rome,
in the year 800, when he received the imperial crown. But Alcuin
was not to be moved by his arguments and entreaties, though he did
not refuse to quit his retirement at the call of real duty. In 799 he
attended the council of Aix-la-Chapelle, to oppose in person the
heretical teacher, Felix of Urgel, who, together with Elipandus, had
revived the Nestorian heresy in a new shape. After a disputation
of six days, Felix owned himself vanquished, and frankly renounced
his errors. This was perhaps the most glorious moment in Alcuin’s
life; but he only used the credit which he had thus obtained with
his sovereign to solicit permission to resign all his preferments into
the hands of his disciples, that he might spend the remainder of his
life in retirement. Frèdegise, therefore, succeeded him in the abbacy
of St. Martin’s, and Sigulf in that of Ferrières. “I have made all
things over into the hands of my sons,” writes the old man, rejoicing
in his late-earned freedom, “and laying down the burden of the
pastoral care, I wait quietly at St. Martin’s until my change shall
come.”</p>

<p>The short remainder of his life was spent in the humblest exercises
of charity and devotion. He chose the place of his interment and
often visited it with disciples, and his letters show him to have
been incessantly occupied with the great thought of his approaching
end. It came at last, and on the morning of Whitsunday, May 19,
804, the great scholar passed gently and happily to the eternity he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
had so long contemplated. Charlemagne mourned his death as
that of a friend and master, and before his final departure addressed
him some Latin verses, which, if not distinguished for much poetical
merit, at least do justice to the honest affection that dictated them.
He survived Alcuin ten years, and was buried in the royal “chapel”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
that he had erected as the place of his sepulture, not reclining in a
coffin, but seated on his throne, with the crown on his brow, the
sceptre in his hand, his good sword Joyeuse by his side, and the
book of the Gospels resting on his knees. And a brief inscription
marked the spot where rested all that was mortal of “the great and
orthodox emperor.”</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of Alcuin in no degree checked the intellectual movement
to which he had communicated the first impulse. He had fairly
done his work; and even after his death his influence survived in
the disciples whom he had so carefully trained and who long supplied
the public schools of the empire with a succession of excellent
masters. St. Martin’s of Tours, indeed, declined under the government
of Fredegise, and the Palatine scholars themselves did not pass
into the best hands. After Alcuin’s withdrawal from court the school
of the palace fell, as we have seen, first under the management of
the Irishman Clement, who had a fancy for changing the whole
method of instruction, and then under that of Claud, Bishop of
Turin, a man of audacious opinions, the only one of the Western
bishops who declared in favour of the Iconoclasts, and who likewise
took up the heretical tenets of Felix of Urgel. The school continued
to decline during the whole reign of Louis le Debonnaire;
but it revived under his son and successor Charles the Bald, who
followed the example of his illustrious grandfather, and gathered
around him learned men from all countries, especially from England
and Ireland. The crowds of scholars who flocked from the latter
island is noticed by Henry of Auxerre, who says, that it seemed as
if Ireland herself were about to pass over into Gaul, and it became
a proverb during the reign of this monarch, that instead of speaking
of the school of the palace, one should rather call the royal residence
the palace of the schools. Charles was not merely an encourager
of humane letters; he possessed a certain philosophical turn of
mind which led him to indulge in abstruse speculations, and to
encourage similar tastes in those around him. He addressed a
capitular to the bishops of his kingdom, questioning them on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
opinions as to the immateriality of the soul; and he placed at the
head of his royal school a scholar more famous for the subtlety of
his intellect than the orthodoxy of his views. John Scotus Erigena,
an Irishman by birth, had early applied himself to the study of the
Greek language and philosophy, and had embraced the chief doctrines
of the Neo-Platonic school. He astonished the Western world by
his translation of the works of St. Denys the Areopagite, an achievement
which the Roman scholars, who still regarded their Transalpine
neighbours as essentially barbarians, could hardly be brought to
credit, and which exhorted compliments from Anastasius, the papal
librarian, and some complaints from Pope Nicholas I., who would
have been better pleased had the work been first submitted to
ecclesiastical approval. Erigena’s free opinions won him no disfavour
with Charles the Bald; nevertheless certain controversies, of which
we shall have to speak hereafter, and in which he took an active
part, drew from him the expression of heterodox sentiments which
excited no little scandal. This was increased by the publication of
his philosophical treatise, “<cite>De Natura Rerum</cite>,” in which he plainly
put forth the doctrines of the Greek Platonists, and represented the
Creator and the creature as essentially one and the same. Besides this
radical Pantheistic error, which runs through all his works, his views
on the subject of the supremacy of reason over authority are liberal
in the extreme.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> “Authority,” he says, “emanates from reason, not
reason from authority; true reason has no need to be supported by
any authority. We must use reason first in our investigations and
authority afterwards.” He also affirmed that the substance of man
was his will. The only punishment of sin, he says, is sin; there is
no eternal fire; even the lost enjoy a certain happiness, for they are
not deprived of truth. These, and a thousand equally unsound
passages, raised him a crowd of adversaries, all of whom he treated
with that supercilious contempt which would seem necessarily to
enter into the character of the scholastic heretic. “They are all
deceived,” he writes, “owing to their ignorance of liberal studies;
they have none of them studied Greek, and with a knowledge of the
Latin language alone it is impossible for them to understand the
distinctions of science.”</p>

<p>In 855 the Council of Valence, nothing dismayed at having to
deal with a foe who was acquainted with Greek, examined his
writings, declared certain propositions extracted from his treatise on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Predestination to be the invention of the devil, and everywhere
interdicted them from being read. Nevertheless, Erigena was not
removed from his post at court; nor was it until ten years later, in
865, that he found himself obliged to retire, in consequence of the
remonstrances addressed to the king by Pope Nicholas I., who
required his removal from the Palatine academy, “where he was
giving poison instead of bread, and mingling his tares with the wheat.”
All authorities agree in regarding him as intellectually superior to any
man of his age, though it is possible that his heterodox principles
have had some share in winning him the extraordinary favour which
he has found at the hands of Hallam and Guizot, who are willing,
naturally enough, to make the most of one who in the Dark Ages set
at nought the claims of authority, and raised the standard of independent
reason. In spite, however, of the prominent position which
he holds among men of letters, and the noisy eulogiums which have
been heaped on him at the expense of his more orthodox contemporaries,
I shall say no more of him in this place than that he
withdrew from Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and was succeeded in his office as Palatine
scholasticus by the monk Mannon, who, after teaching with success
for some years, returned to his monastery at Condat; after which
we hear no more of the Palatine school till its revival, at the beginning
of the tenth century, under the famous Remigius of Auxerre.</p>

<p>But the Palatine school by no means held the most important
place in the educational institutions bequeathed by Charlemagne to
the empire. The work begun by Alcuin was being far more successfully
carried out in the monastic schools, especially those of Fulda,
Rheims, and the two Corbys. The abbey of Fulda, mindful of its
great origin, was one of the first to enter heartily into the revival of
letters initiated by Charlemagne; and in order to fit the monks for
the work to which they were called, it was resolved to send two of
the younger brethren to study under Alcuin himself at Tours, that
after being there imbued with all the liberal arts, they might return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
to their own monastery as teachers. The two chosen for this purpose
were Hatto and Rabanus, and they accordingly began their studies
at St. Martin’s in 802. The name of Maurus was bestowed by Alcuin
on his favourite disciple, and was afterwards retained by Rabanus in
addition to his own. He studied both sacred and profane sciences,
as appears from the letter he addressed many years later to his old
schoolfellow, Haimo, Bishop of Halberstadt, in which he reminds
him of the pleasant days they had spent together in studious
exercises, reading, not only the Sacred books, and the expositions
of the Fathers, but also investigating all the seven liberal arts. In
813, being then twenty-five years of age, Rabanus was recalled to
Fulda, by the abbot Ratgar, and placed at the head of the school,
with the strict injunction that he was to follow in all things the
method of his master Alcuin. The latter was still alive, and
addressed a letter to the young preceptor, which is printed among
his other works, and is addressed to “the boy Maurus,” in which he
wishes him good luck with his scholars. His success was so extraordinary
that the abbots of other monasteries sent their monks to
study under him, and were eager to obtain his pupils as professors
in their own schools. The German nobles also gladly confided their
sons to his care, and he taught them with wonderful gentleness and
patience. He carried out the system which had been adopted by
Alcuin of thoroughly exercising his scholars in grammar before
entering on the study of the other liberal arts. “All the generations
of Germany,” says Trithemius, “are bound to celebrate the praise
of Rabanus, who first taught them to articulate the sound of Greek
and Latin.” At his lectures every one was trained to write equally
well in prose or verse on any subject placed before him, and was
afterwards taken through a course of rhetoric, logic, and natural
philosophy, according to the capacities of each. From this time the
school of Fulda came to be regarded as one of the first monastic
seminaries of Europe, and held a rank at least equal to that of St.
Gall. It had inherited the fullest share of the Anglo-Saxon spirit,
and exhibited the same spectacle of intellectual activity which we
have already seen working in the foundations of St. Bennet Biscop.
Every variety of useful occupation was embraced by the monks;
while some were at work hewing down the old forest which a few
years before had given shelter to the mysteries of Pagan worship, or
tilling the soil on those numerous farms which to this day perpetuate
the memory of the great abbey in the names of the towns and villages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
which have sprung up on their site,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> other kinds of industry were
kept up within doors, where the visitor might have beheld a huge
range of workshops in which cunning hands were kept constantly
busy on every description of useful and ornamental work in wood,
stone, and metal. It was a scene, not of artistic <em>dilettanteism</em>, but
of earnest, honest labour, and the treasurer of the abbey was charged
to take care that the sculptors, engravers, and carvers in wood, were
always furnished with plenty to do. Passing on to the interior of
the building the stranger would have been introduced to the scriptorium,
over the door of which was an inscription warning the
copyists to abstain from idle words, to be diligent in copying good
books, and to take care not to alter the text by careless mistakes.
Twelve monks always sat here employed in the labour of transcription,
as was also the custom at Hirsauge, a colony sent out from Fulda in
830; and the huge library which was thus gradually formed, survived
till the beginning of the seventeenth century, when it was destroyed
in the troubles of the thirty years’ war. Not far from the scriptorium
was the interior school, where the studies were carried on with an
ardour and a largeness of views, which might have been little expected
from an academy of the ninth century. Our visitor, were he from
the more civilised south, might well have stood in mute surprise in
the midst of these fancied barbarians, whom he would have found
engaged in pursuits not unworthy of the schools of Rome. The
monk Probus is perhaps lecturing on Virgil and Cicero, and that
with such hearty enthusiasm that his brother professors accuse him,
in good-natured jesting, of ranking them with the saints. Elsewhere
disputations are being carried on over the Categories of Aristotle,
and an attentive ear will discover that the controversy which made
such a noise in the twelfth century, and divided the philosophers of
Europe into the rival sects of the Nominalists and Realists, is perfectly
well understood at Fulda, though it does not seem to have
disturbed the peace of the school. To your delight, if you be not
altogether wedded to the dead languages, you may find some engaged
on the uncouth language of their father-land, and, looking over their
shoulders, you may smile to see the barbarous words which they are
cataloguing in their glossaries; words, nevertheless, destined to
reappear centuries hence in the most philosophic literature of Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
The monks of Fulda derive their scholastic traditions from Alcuin
and Bede, and cannot, therefore, neglect a study of the vernacular.
Yet they are, I am sorry to say, beset with one weakness common
to the scholars of the time, and are ashamed of their Frankish and
Saxon names; and Hatto, Bruno, and Rechi, three of the best
pupils of Rabanus, are known in his academy under the Latin
soubriquets of Bonosus, Candidus, and Modestus. Brower, in his
“Antiquities of Fulda,” has depicted the two last-named scholars
from an illuminated manuscript of their monastery in which their
portraits are introduced. Candidus, the assistant of Rabanus in the
school, holds a book in one hand while with the other he points out
to Modestus a passage on the page before him. From the open lips
and extended hand of his pupil we surmise that he is reciting the
words thus indicated. Both are clothed in the tunic without sleeves,
scapular, and large capuce which then formed the Benedictine habit.
It may be added that the school of Fulda would have been found
ordered with admirable discipline. Twelve of the best professors
were chosen and formed a council of seniors or doctors, presided
over by one who bore the title of Principal, and who assigned to each
one the lectures he was to deliver to the pupils.</p>

<p>In the midst of this world of intellectual life and labour, Rabanus
continued for some years to train the first minds of Germany, and
counted among his pupils the most celebrated men of the age, such
as Lupus of Ferrières, Walafrid Strabo, and Ruthard of Hirsauge,
the latter of whom was the first who read profane letters to the
brethren of his convent “after the manner of Fulda.” Lupus was a
monk of Ferrières, where he had been carefully educated by the
abbot Aldric, who was a pupil of Sigulf, and had acted for some
time as assistant to Alcuin in the school of Tours. Aldric afterwards
became Archbishop of Sens, and sent Lupus to complete his education
at Fulda, under Rabanus. Like all the scholars of Ferrières,
Lupus had a decided taste for classical literature; the love of letters
had been, to use his own expression, innate in him from a child, and
he was considered the best Latinist of his time. His studies at Fulda
were chiefly theological, and he applied to them with great ardour,
without, however, forgetting “his dear humanities.” It would even
seem that he taught them at Fulda, thus returning one benefit for
another. The monastery was not far from that of Seligenstadt, where
Eginhard, the secretary and biographer of Charlemagne, was their
abbot. A friendship, based on similarity of tastes, sprang up between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
him and Lupus, and was maintained by a correspondence, much of
which is still preserved. Lupus always reckoned Eginhard as one of
his masters; not that he directly received any lessons from him, but
on account of the assistance which the abbot rendered him by the
loan of valuable books. In one of his earliest letters to this good
friend he begs for a copy of Cicero’s “Rhetoric,” his own being imperfect,
as well as for the “Attic Nights” of Aulus Gellius, which
were not then to be found in the Fulda library. In another letter,
he consults him on the exact prosody of certain Latin words, and
begs him to send the proper size of the Uncial letters used in manuscripts
of that century.</p>

<p>Among the fellow-students of Lupus at this time was Walafrid
Strabo, a man of very humble birth, whose precocious genius had
early made him known in the world of letters. In spite of the unfortunate
personal defect which earned him his surname of Strabo,
(or the lame), Walafrid’s Latin verses had gained him respect among
learned men at the age of fifteen, and they are favourably noticed
even by critics of our own time. He had received his early training
in the monastery of Reichnau, the situation of which was well fitted
to nurture a poetic genius. His masters had been Tetto and Wettin,
the latter of whom was author of that terrible “Vision of Purgatory”
which left an indelible impress on the popular devotion of Christendom.
From Reichnau he was sent by his superiors to study at
Fulda, where he acquired a taste for historical pursuits, and is said
to have assisted in the compilation of the annals of the monastery.
It was out of the Fulda library that he collected the materials for his
great work, the Gloss, or Commentary on the Text of Scripture,
gathered from the writings of the Fathers. It received many additions
and improvements from subsequent writers, and, for more than
six hundred years, continued to be the most popular explanation of
the Sacred text in use among theologians. Returning to Reichnau,
Walafrid was appointed to the office of scholasticus, and filled it with
such success as fairly to establish the reputation of that monastic
school. Ermanric, one of his pupils, says of him, that to the end of
his life he continued to exhibit the same delightful union of learning
and simplicity which had endeared him to his masters and school-fellows.
Even after he was appoined abbot, he found his chief pleasure
in study, teaching, and writing verses, and would steal away
from the weightier cares of his office to take a class in his old school
and expound to them a passage of Virgil. Neither old age nor busy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
practical duties dried up the fount of Abbot Walafrid’s inspiration,
and we find him in his declining years writing his poems entitled
“<cite>Hortulus</cite>,” wherein he describes with charming freshness of imagery,
the little garden blooming beneath the window of his cell, and the
beauty and virtue of the different flowers which he loved to cultivate
with his own hands.</p>

<p>Another of the Fulda scholars contemporary with those named
above, was Otfried, a monk of Weissemburg, who entered with
singular ardour into the study of the Tudesque dialect. Rabanus
himself devoted much attention to this subject, and composed a
Latin and German glossary on the books of Scripture, together with
some other etymological works, among which is a curious treatise
on the origin of languages. Otfried took up his master’s favourite
pursuits with great warmth, and the completion of Charlemagne’s
German grammar is thought to be in reality his work, though
generally assigned to Rabanus. On retiring to his own monastery,
where he was charged with the direction of the school, he continued
to make the improvement of his native language the chief object of
his study. A noble zeal prompted him to produce something in
the vernacular idiom which should take the place of those profane
songs, often of heathen origin, which had hitherto been the only
production of the German muse. Encouraged by a certain noble
lady named Judith, to whom he confided his ideas, he conceived
the plan of rendering into Tudesque verse the most remarkable
passages from the Life of Our Lord, which he chose so happily, and
wove together with so skilful a hand, that his work may be regarded
as a Harmony of the Gospel narrative. It was accompanied with
four dedicatory epistles, in one of which, addressed to Luitbert,
Archbishop of Mentz, he complains of the neglect with which the
Franks have hitherto treated their own language. Prudentius, Juvencus,
and other Latin writers had written the Acts of the Lord in
Latin verse, wherefore he now desired to attempt the same in his
mother tongue. “I wish,” he says, “to write the Gospels, the history
of our salvation, in the Frankish tongue. Now, therefore, let all
men of good-will rejoice, and let those of the Frankish tongue also
rejoice, and be glad, since we have lived to celebrate the praises of
Christ in the language of our fathers.” The other epistles were
addressed to the Emperor Louis, and to some of the monks of St.
Gall, who were celebrated for the labour which they bestowed on
the cultivation of the Tudesque dialect, and could therefore appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Otfried’s work at its full value. It had the effect which he
anticipated; his verses became familiar in the mouths of those who
had hitherto been acquainted only with the rude songs of their
pagan ancestors, and dispelled much of the prejudice which existed
against the use of the barbarous dialects for the purpose of religious
instruction. And in 847, three months after Rabanus was raised
to the see of Mentz, a decree was published by the provincial
council, requiring every bishop to provide himself with homilies for
the instruction of the people, translated out of Latin into Tudesque
or Romanesque (as the Rustic Latin was sometimes called), that
they might be understood by rude and ignorant persons.</p>

<p>The character of Rabanus may be gathered from that of his
pupils. He was in every respect a true example of the monastic
scholar, and took St. Bede for the model on which his own life was
formed. All the time not taken up with religious duties he devoted
to reading, teaching, writing, or “feeding himself on the Divine
Scriptures.” The best lesson he gave his scholars was the example
of his own life, as Eginhard indicates in a letter written to his son,
then studying as a novice at Fulda. “I would have you apply to
literary exercises,” he says, “and try as far as you can to acquire the
learning of your master, whose lessons are so clear and solid. But
specially imitate his holy life.... For grammar and rhetoric and
all human sciences are vain and even injurious to the servants of
God, unless by Divine grace they know how to follow the law of
God; for science puffeth up, but charity buildeth up. I would
rather see you dead than inflated with vice.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the career of Rabanus was far from being one of
unruffled repose, and the history of his troubles presents us with a
singular episode in monastic annals. The abbot Ratgar was one of
those men whose activity of mind and body was a cross to every
one about him. He could neither rest himself nor suffer anybody
else to be quiet. The ordinary routine of life at Fulda, with its prodigious
amount of daily labour, both mental and physical, did not
satisfy the requirements of his peculiar organisation. He had a fancy
for rearranging the whole discipline of the monastery, and was specially
desirous of providing himself with more splendid buildings than
those which had been raised by the followers of the humble Sturm.
Every one knows that the passion for building has in it a directly
revolutionary element; it is synonymous with a passion for upsetting,
destroying, and reducing everything to chaos. Hence, the monks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Fulda had but an uncomfortable time of it, and what was worse,
Ratgar was so eager to get his fine buildings completed, that he not
only compelled his monks to work as masons, but shortened their
prayers and masses, and obliged them to labour on festivals.
Rabanus himself could claim no exemption; he had to exchange the
pen for the trowel; and to take away all possibility of excuse, Ratgar
deprived him of his books, and even of the private notes which he
had made of Alcuin’s lectures. Rabanus was too good a monk to
protest against his change of employment, and carried his bricks and
mortar as cheerfully as ever he had applied himself to a copy of
Cicero; but he did not conceive it contrary to religious obedience
humbly to protest against the confiscation of his papers, and
attempted to soften the hard heart of his abbot with a copy of verses.
“O sweet father!” he exclaims, “most excellent shepherd of monks!
I thy servant pray thee to be propitious, and to let thy tender pity hear
me, who cry to thee though unworthy. O ever-compassionate Ruler!
thy kindness in old time permitted me to study books, but the
poverty of my understanding was a hindrance to me; and lest my
wandering mind should lose all that my master taught me by word of
mouth, I committed everything to writing. These writings in time
formed little books, which I pray thee command to be returned to
thy unworthy client. Whatever slaves possess is held by right of
their masters, therefore all that I have written is thine by right.
Nor do I petulantly claim these papers as my own, but defer all things
to thy judgment; and whether thou grantest my petition or not, I pray
God to grant thee all good things, and help thee to finish the good fight
by an honourable course.”</p>

<p>Such a petition, so just, so modest, and so free from the least tinge
of insubordination might have been thought capable of touching the
hardest heart, but, says Rudolf his biographer, “he sang to a stone.”
The building grievance at last grew to such a pitch, that the monks
in despair appealed to Charlemagne, who summoned Ratgar to court
to answer their charges, and appointed a commission of bishops and
abbots to inquire into the whole matter. Their decision allayed the
discord for a time, and so long as the emperor lived, Ratgar showed
his monks some consideration. But no sooner was he dead than the
persecution recommenced, and Rabanus, again deprived of his books
and papers, seems to have consoled himself by making a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem. He describes the unhappy state of Fulda at this time,
in some very doleful verses addressed to one of the exiled monks;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
for, not content with overwhelming his brethren with fresh labours,
Ratgar had turned many out of the monastery, chiefly the aged ones,
whose temperate remonstrances annoyed him. We have in these
verses a touching account of the farewell visit paid by the exiles
before their departure to the tomb of St. Boniface, whom they conjured
to intercede in their favour. Some of them did not rest content
with a course of passive submission, but repaired once more to
court and implored the Emperor Louis to apply some remedy to the
abuses, which threatened to end in the disruption of the first
religious house in his dominions. A new commission was therefore
appointed, and <ins class="corr" id="tn154" title="Transcriber’s Note—“the result was that Ragtar” changed to “the result was that Ratgar”.">the result was that Ratgar</ins> was deposed from office
and banished from the monastery, while in his place was elected the
holy and gentle St. Eigil, a disciple of St. Sturm, whose government
presented a singular contrast to that of the harsh and haughty
Ratgar. He did nothing without consulting his brethren, and made
it his aim to heal the wounds which a long course of ill-treatment
had opened in the community. To set his children an example of
humility and paternal concord, he often served them at table, and
especially during the feast of Christmas. In his overflowing love
and charity, he petitioned, as a personal favour, that they would
consent to the recall of poor Ratgar, and on his return it appeared
that his humiliation had not been without a beneficial effect. He
showed no disposition to disturb the peace of the community again,
but as the twofold desire of commanding and of building was not
wholly eradicted from his soul, they let him satisfy it in moderation,
by constructing a small monastery on an adjoining hill, to which he
afterwards removed himself. He seems to have made a good end,
asking pardon of all those whom he had offended, and Fulda very
soon recovered its former flourishing condition. Rabanus was
restored to his books and his school immediately on the election of
St. Eigil, and in 822, on the death of the good abbot, whose life was
written by the monk Candidus, Rabanus was chosen his successor.
To him this was a very sorrowful business, for, with the government
of a community of one hundred and fifty monks on his hands, he
was necessarily obliged to give up his scholars. He resigned them
to the care of Candidus, in all that concerned the humane letters,
reserving to himself, however, the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures.
Singularly enough, however, the man whose whole life had
been passed in literary labour, evinced a talent for business not
always found united to great scholarship. He kept up regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
discipline, and put all the offices of the abbey in a state of thorough
efficiency, completing many of the half-finished buildings of Ratgar,
and enriching his treasury with a vast quantity of holy relics. He
also looked so well after the farms and dependencies of the abbey
as greatly to increase its revenues. Still the school was not neglected,
and the lectures he delivered there were destined to be the seeds of
a work important in the history of ecclesiastical literature. His pupils
had been accustomed from time to time to ask him questions on the
chief duties of ecclesiastics and their signification, and the proper
manner of administering the Rites of Holy Church. His answers
they noted down on their tablets, without, however, observing much
method, and as the matter constantly increased in bulk and value,
they begged him at length to revise their notes and arrange them in
better order. The result was his celebrated Treatise <cite>De Institutione
Clericorum</cite>, an invaluable monument of the faith and practice of the
Church in the ninth century. It treats in three books of the Sacraments,
the Divine office, the feasts and fasts of the Church, and the
learning necessary for ecclesiastics, concluding with instructions and
rules for the guidance of preachers. On the last subject he observes
that three things are necessary in order to become a good preacher;
first, to be a good man yourself, that you may be able to teach
others to be so; secondly, to be skilled in the Holy Scriptures and
the interpretations of the Fathers; thirdly, and above all, to prepare
for the work of preaching by that of prayer. As to the studies
proper to ecclesiastics, he distinctly requires them to be learned not
only in the Scriptures, but also in the seven liberal arts, provided
only that these are treated as the handmaids of theology, and he
explains his views on this subject much in the same way as Bede
had done before him. For the rest, he was an enemy to anything
like narrowness of intellectual training. His own works, in prose
and verse, embraced a large variety of subjects, some of them belonging
to mystic theology, such as his book on the Vision of God
and his poem on the Holy Cross, which, in spite of its inaccurate
prosody, still raises the admiration of the reader from the elevation
of its sentiments. He is also commonly reputed the author of the
“Veni Creator.”</p>

<p>In 847, Rabanus was raised to the archiepiscopal see of Mentz, in
which office he was called on to examine the errors of Gotteschalk,
a man who, beginning life as a monk of Fulda, had quitted that
monastery in disgust, and subsequently led a wandering and not very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
reputable life, though he appears to have considered himself attached
to the monastery of Orbais. The opinions he broached on the
subject of predestination being condemned by the council of Mentz,
Rabanus sent him to his own metropolitan, Hincmar, Archbishop of
Rheims. The severity with which he was treated was disapproved
even by many who condemned his doctrines, and a warm controversy
arose, in the course of which Hincmar, who was far more a man
of action than of the pen, bethought himself of employing on his
side of the argument the genius of Scotus Erigena, then at the head
of the Palatine school. Erigena was as yet only known to the
learned world as a Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic scholar, and a man
of surpassing wit and power of argument. His heterodox tendencies
were not even suspected, and Hincmar congratulated himself on
having engaged the services of one confessedly without a rival in the
arena of letters. But his choice of an ally proved most unfortunate.
Erigena opened fire on the opposite party with the assertion,
characteristic enough of the self-sufficient sophist, that every question,
on every imaginable subject, was capable of solution when
submitted to the four philosophic rules of division, definition,
demonstration, and analysis. To work he went, therefore, with his
four rules, and while combating the ultra-predestination of Gottischalk,
gave utterance to such free opinions on the subject of Divine
Grace as raised against him all the theologians of France. Among
these were St. Prudentius of Troyes, Amolan, Archbishop of Lyons,
a Hebrew scholar whose wise and moderate manner of dealing with
the subject aimed at refuting the errors of both the opposite partisans,
and his successor, St. Remigius. The opinions put forth by Scotus
had increased the difficulties of the question, and writers thickened
on both sides. It is needless to say that neither Rabanus nor
Hincmar were any way responsible for the errors broached by
Scotus; nevertheless, the line of argument which they took did not
satisfy the theologians of Valence and Lyons, and in the course of
the controversy which troubled his declining years, Rabanus found
himself opposed by his former pupil, Lupus of Ferrières. He died
in 856, leaving his books to be equally divided between the abbeys
of Fulda and St. Alban’s, of Mentz.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lupus of Ferrières had become abbot of his monastery,
for Sigulf in his old age resigned his dignity, and chose to become
the disciple of his former pupil. Lupus continued after his promotion
to carry on his labours in the monastic school. The favour with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
which he was regarded by Charles the Bald was the occasion of
much trouble to the poor scholar, who was constantly summoned to
act as royal ambassador, and sometimes even to join the army and
take part in active war. His monastery happened to be one of those
which owed the king military service, and in an action fought in
Angoumois between Charles and his nephew Pepin, Lupus, who had
no taste at all for the life of a soldier, lost all his baggage and found
himself a prisoner. So soon as he recovered his liberty he addressed
a moving letter to the king, imploring him to set him free henceforth
from his military engagements at any price. “Most willingly,” he
says, “will I resume the office of professor in my monastery, for I
desire nothing better than all my life to teach what I have learnt.”
Charles appears to have seen that by persisting in his feudal claims
he would only be making a very bad soldier out of an admirable
scholar, so he suffered him to return to Ferrières, where he set about
collecting a noble library, as well sacred as profane. As he wrote
himself to Einard, he never grew weary of books; he took extraordinary
pains in seeking for his treasures even in distant countries,
in causing them to be transcribed, and sometimes in lovingly
transcribing them himself. His interesting correspondence contains
frequent allusions to these Bibliographical researches. At one time
he asks a friend to bring him the “Wars of Catiline and of Jugurtha”
by Sallust, and the “Verrines of Cicero.” At another, he writes to
Pope Benedict III., begging him to send by two of his monks, about
to journey to Rome, certain books which he could not obtain in his
own country, and which he promises to have speedily copied and
faithfully returned. They are, the “Commentaries of St. Jerome on
Jeremias,” “Cicero de Oratore,” the twelve books of Quinctilian’s
Institutes, and the “Commentary of Donatus on Terence.” With
all his taste for the classics, however, Lupus had too much good
sense not to see the importance of cultivating the barbarous dialects,
and sent his nephew with two other noble youths to Prom, to learn
the Tudesque idiom.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In his school he made it his chief aim to
train his pupils, not only in grammar and rhetoric, but also in the
higher art of a holy life. The monastic seminaries were proverbially
schools of good living as well as good learning, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recte faciendi et bene
dicendi</i>, as Mabillon expresses it; and there was nothing that Lupus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
had more at heart than the inculcation of this principle, that the
cultivation of head and heart must go together. “We too often
seek in study,” he writes in his epistle to the monk Ebradus, “nothing
but ornament of style; few are found who desire to acquire by its
means purity of manners, which is of far greater value. We are very
much afraid of vices of language, and use every effort to correct
them, but we regard with indifference the vices of the heart.” His
favourite Cicero had before his time lifted a warning voice against
the capital error of disjoining mental from moral culture, and in the
Christian system of the earlier centuries they were never regarded
apart.</p>

<p>Lupus was not too great a scholar to condescend to labour for
beginners, and drew up, for the benefit of his pupils, an abridgment
of Roman history, in which he proposes the characters of
Traian and Theodosius for the study of Christian princes. He
was wont to boast of his double descent from Alcuin, as being a
pupil of Sigulf and Rabanus, both of them disciples of the great
master. His own favourite scholar Heiric, or Henry of Auxerre,
indulged in a similar morsel of scholastic pride. He had studied
under both Lupus and Haimo of Halberstadt, the former school-fellow
of Rabanus, at St. Martin of Tours. Haimo seems to have
lectured for some time at Ferrières, and Heiric tells us in some not
inelegant verses that it was the custom of the two pedagogues to
give their pupils a very pleasant sort of recreation, relating to them
whatever they had found in the course of their reading that was
worthy of remembrance, whether in Christian or Pagan authors.
Heiric, who was somewhat of an intellectual glutton, and had a
craving for learning of all sorts and on all imaginable subjects, made
for himself a little book, in which he diligently noted down every
scrap that fell from the lips of his masters. This book he
subsequently published, and dedicated to Hildebold, Bishop of
Auxerre. Heiric himself afterwards became a man of letters; he
was appointed scholasticus of St. Germain’s of Auxerre, and was
intrusted with the education of Lothaire, son of Charles the Bald, as
we learn from the epistle addressed to that monarch which he
prefixed to his life of St. Germanus, in which he speaks of the young
prince, recently dead, as in years a boy, but in mind a philosopher.
Another of his pupils was the famous Remigius of Auxerre, who,
towards the end of the ninth century, was summoned to Rheims by
Archbishop Fulk, to re-establish sacred studies in that city, and worked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
there in concert with his former schoolfellow, Hucbald of St. Amand,
who attained a curious sort of reputation by his poem on bald men,
each line of which began with the letter C, the whole being intended
as a compliment to Charles the Bald. Fulk himself became their
first pupil, and after thoroughly restoring the school of Rheims,
Remigius passed on to Paris, where we shall have occasion to notice
him among the teachers of the tenth century. From his time the
schools of Paris continued to increase in reputation and importance,
till they developed into the great university which may thus be
distinctly traced through a pedigree of learned men up to the great
Alcuin himself. This genealogy of pedagogues is of no small
interest, as showing the efforts made in the worst of times to keep
alive the spark of science and the persistence with which, in spite of
civil wars and Norman invasions, the scholastic traditions of Alcuin
were maintained.</p>

<p>We must not take leave of abbot Lupus without noticing one
other pupil of his, more celebrated than any yet named, the great
St. Ado of Vienne. He studied in the school of Ferrières under
Sigulf, Aldric and Lupus, and from his school life his masters predicted
his future sanctity. The jealousy of his companions obliging
him to leave Ferrières, he removed to Prom, and placed himself
under the discipline of the good abbot Marcward, and there taught
the sacred sciences for some years, after which he found himself
able to return to Ferrières. During the course of a journey
into Italy he met with an ancient martyrology, which served as the
basis on which he compiled his own, which was published in 858.
Two years later he became Archbishop of Vienne, and in that office
did much for the promotion of letters. The scholars of these dark
ages were often bound together in ties of very close friendship,
founded on mutual tastes, the recollection of early school days spent
together under some wise and well-loved master, and the exchange of
good offices in the shape of manuscripts lent and borrowed. If
Ado’s intellectual superiority had made him enemies among a few of
the more churlish spirits of Ferrières, his sweet and amiable disposition
elsewhere earned him many friends. Among these was the
Deacon Wandalbert, a monk of Prom, and the learned Florus of
Lyons. When Ado left Prom, Wandalbert succeeded him as scholasticus,
and a famous one he made. His peculiar line was natural
philosophy, and in pursuing it he was not content with gathering up
other men’s ideas, but observed and experimentalised for himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
He greatly excelled in poetry, and produced a martyrology written
in verse, in which, besides hymns in honour of the different saints
whom he commemorates, he contrives to introduce short poems
descriptive of the seasons, the different rustic labours proper to each
month, the beauties of nature under her different aspects, seed-time
and harvest, the vintage and the chase; together with other more
learned subjects, such as the movements of the heavenly bodies by
which we regulate our time. He gives rules for telling the time by
the length of shadow cast by the sun, though he is careful to remind
the reader that these rules will not be the same in all countries, inasmuch
as in those that lie more to the south the shadows will
necessarily be shorter, the earth being then more directly under the
solar rays.</p>

<p>We must now turn to the great abbey of Old Corby, where, as we
have already seen, Adalhard, a Palatine scholar, and a prince of the
blood-royal, had retired from the perils of a courtier’s life, and
become abbot. Unusual importance attached to its monastic school,
from the circumstance of its having been chosen by Charlemagne as
the academy to which the youth of Saxony were sent for education,
in order that on their return to their own country they might assist
in planting the Church on a solid foundation. The master chosen
for the task of rearing these future missionaries was Paschasius
Radpert, one of the most remarkable men of his time. Originally
of very humble birth, he owed his education to the charity of the
nuns of Soissons, who first received the desolate child into their own
out-quarters, and then sent him to some monks in the same city,
under whose tuition he acquired a fair amount of learning, and
addicted himself to the study of Virgil, Horace, Cicero, and Terence.
He never forgot the kindness of his early benefactresses, and in after
years dedicated his Treatise on the Virginity of the Blessed Virgin
to the good nuns, styling himself therein their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alumnus</i>, or foster-son.
The deep humility of this great scholar is spoken of by all his biographers
as his characteristic virtue, and is apparent in a passage
which occurs in his exposition of the 44th Psalm, which he dedicates
to these same nuns. In it he refers to the fact of his having received
the clerical tonsure in their Church, and, as it would seem, in their
presence. After expressing the reverence he feels for those whose
names are written in heaven, and whom he regards not only as the
spouses of Christ, but as the choicest flowers in the garden of the
Church, he goes on to say: “When I behold you I sigh bitterly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
think that this sacred crown, which as a boy I received before the
holy altar of the Mother of God, in the midst of your prayers and
offices of praise, I lost long ago, exiled in the world’s wilderness, and
stained by many worldly actions.... I pray you, therefore, when
you lift up your hearts on high, be mindful of me also, and implore
for me the divine grace, that the most clement Judge may restore to
me my lost crown.” In fact, after receiving the tonsure in early
youth, Paschasius, whose tastes for Terence and Cicero rather predominated
at that time over his relish for more sacred studies,
abandoned his first inclination for the cloister, and lived for some
years a secular life. Touched at last by divine grace, he entered
the abbey of Old Corby, and there made his profession under the
abbot Adalhard. All the ardour he had previously shown in the
pursuit of profane literature he now applied to the study of the
Divine Scriptures. Yet he only devoted to study of any kind those
“furtive hours,” as he calls them, which he was able to steal from
the duties of regular discipline, and was never seen so happy as
when engaged in the choral office or the meaner occupations of
community life. Such, then, was the master chosen by Adalhard
for the responsible office of scholasticus, and a very minute account
is left us of his manner of discharging its duties. Every day he
delivered lectures on the sacred sciences, besides preaching to the
monks on Sundays and Festivals. His thorough familiarity with the
best Latin authors appears from the frequent allusions to them which
occur in his writings. Quotations from the classic poets drop from
his pen, as it were, half unconsciously, and we are told that he continued
to keep up his acquaintance with them, so far as was necessary
for teaching others. But his own study was now chiefly confined to
the Holy Scriptures and the Fathers;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and among the latter, his
favourites were St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. John
Chrysostom, St. Bede, and St. Gregory the Great. “He did not
approve,” says his biographer, “of the diligence displayed by some
men of the time in explaining and meditating on profane authors.”
In a passage which occurs in the preface to his exposition of St.
Matthew’s Gospel, he blames those lovers of secular learning, “who
seek various and divers expounders, that so they may attain to the
understanding of beautiful lies concerning shameful things, and who
will not pass over&mdash;I do not say a single page, but a single line or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
syllable, without thoroughly investigating it, with the utmost labour
and vigilance, while at the same time they utterly neglect the Sacred
Scriptures. I wonder,” he continues, “that the Divine words can
be so distasteful to them, and that they can refuse to scrutinise the
mysteries of God with the same diligence they so unweariedly bestow
on the follies of profane tragedies and the foolish fables of the poets.
Who can doubt that such labour is altogether thrown away, being
bestowed on a thing undeserving of reward?” This was not the
utterance of a narrow-minded bigot, who condemned pursuits and
tastes to which he was himself a stranger. Few were more keenly
alive than he to the charms of polite literature, neither did he at
all condemn its use within proper limits, even among cloistered
students. It would, indeed, have been a difficult matter to have
eradicated the love of the beautiful from the heart of Paschasius.
He possessed it in every shape, and was not merely a poet, but a
musician also. In one of his writings he lets fall an observation
which might be taken for a prose rendering of a verse of Shelley’s,
although the Christian scholar goes beyond the infidel poet, and
does not merely describe the sentiment which all have felt, but traces
it to its proper source. Shelley complains that&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent6">With some pain is fraught;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Paschasius explains the mystery: “There is no song to be found,”
he says, “without a tone of sadness in it; even as here below there
are no joys without a mixture of sorrow; for songs of pure joy belong
only to the heavenly Sion, but lamentation is the property of our
earthly pilgrimage.” His musical tastes were perfectly shared and
understood by his master St. Adalhard, whose sensibility to the
influence of melodious sounds is spoken of by his biographer Gerard.
Even during his residence at the court of Charlemagne, it is said of
him that “he was always so full of a sweet intention towards God,
that if while assisting at the royal council he heard the sound of
some chance melody, he had it not in his power to refrain from
tears, for all sweet music seemed to remind him of his heavenly
country.” The importance attached to the study of music by the
Christian scholastics of these times is not a little remarkable. They
inherited the traditions of the ancients, and with them regarded
music as a science intimately associated with the knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
divine things. They were the true descendants of those holy fathers
of old, who, as the son of Sirach tells us, “sought out musical
tunes and published canticles, and were rich in virtue, studying
beautifulness, and living at peace in their houses.” The narratives
of our early English schools will sufficiently have illustrated the fact
that music held a very prominent place in the system of education
which held sway in the early centuries; and the theory on which
this high esteem was based will nowhere be found better explained
than in the writings of Rabanus. “Musical discipline,” he says, “is
so noble and useful a thing, that without it no one can properly
discharge the ecclesiastical office. For whatsoever in reading is
correctly pronounced, and whatsoever in chanting is sweetly modulated,
is regulated by a knowledge of this discipline; and by it we
not only learn how to read and sing in the church, but also rightly
perform every rite in the divine service. Moreover, the discipline
of music is diffused through all the acts of our life. For when we
keep the commandments of God, and observe His law, it is certain
that our words and acts are associated by musical rhythm with the
virtues of harmony. If we observe a good conversation, we prove
ourselves associated with this discipline; but when we act sinfully,
we have in us no music.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Paschasius, then, was a poet and a musician, but he was also a
scientific theologian, and one who was in some degree in advance of
his age in the philosophic method he adopted when analysing the
dogmas of faith. In the year 831 he wrote his famous treatise on
the “Sacrament of the Altar,” which was specially intended for the
instruction of his Saxon pupils, who required a plain and comprehensive
exposition of that mystery. He composed it, therefore, in
a very simple style, comparing it to “milk for babes;” and it is
evident that in a treatise drawn up under such circumstances, for
the instruction of young converts, the author would necessarily seek,
not the setting forth of theological subtleties or private views, but
the simple, straightforward statement of the Church’s doctrine as
universally taught and believed by all the faithful. He declares in
very express and distinct terms that “the <em>substance of bread</em> is not to
be found in the Sacrament, and that there is present only the Real
Body of Jesus Christ, the same that was born of the B. Virgin, and
was crucified, and rose again, and ascended into Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
treatise was dedicated to Warin, abbot of New Corby, and excited
no controversy until fifteen years later, when a second edition,
dedicated to Charles the Bald, fell into the hands of Scotus Erigena,
whose captious mind found matter of offence in the expressions used
by Paschasius. He, accordingly, wrote in reply <em>his</em> treatise on the
“Holy Eucharist,” of which no copy now exists; for, after being
condemned by several Councils, all the copies that could be found
were ordered to be burnt in 1059, in consequence of the use made
of them by the Berengarian heretics. Paschasius defended his
words by a simple appeal to the universal sense of Christendom,
which, since the days of the Apostles, had never ceased to believe
and confess this salutary doctrine.</p>

<p>At the time when this vexatious controversy broke out he was
abbot of his monastery, and soon after retired from office, and joyfully
returned to his cell and his studies, spending his last days in
the completion of his greatest work, the “Commentary on St.
Matthew’s Gospel.” Whether in public or private life, his lowliness
of spirit was equally remarkable, while the self-sufficient presumption
of his opponent Erigena exhibits an ugly example of that knowledge
which puffeth up. In Paschasius we see the opposite virtue, which
faileth not “when tongues shall cease and knowledge shall be
destroyed.” He styled himself by no more honourable title than
the “Monachorum Peripsema,” and in his last sickness imposed so
strict an injunction on his brethren never to write his life, that they
dared not disobey him, and thus many interesting particulars concerning
him have necessarily been lost.</p>

<p>He left many disciples, among whom was Anscharius, who succeeded
him in the government of his school, and of whom we must
now say something. He had begun his school life very early, being
sent to the monastery after his mother’s death, when a child of
only five; and, says his biographer, Rembert, after the manner of
young children, he showed at first a much greater liking for childish
sports than for learning of any kind. At five this may perhaps be
thought excusable, but there are those whom wisdom preventeth,
and when they go forth they find her “sitting at their door.” And
to Anscharius the love of wisdom was brought by Her who is herself
“the Mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of
holy hope; in whom is all grace of the way and of the truth, all
hope of life and of virtue.” One night he seemed to find himself
in a dark and gloomy place, out of which, when he sought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
find some way of escape, he perceived a delightful path wherein
Our Lady appeared to him surrounded by a crowd of saints clothed
in white garments, among whom he recognised his mother. He ran
towards her, stretching out his childish hands; whereupon the
Blessed Virgin addressed him, saying: “My son, do you wish to
come to your mother? Know that if you would share in her happiness
you must fly from vanity, lay aside childish follies, and abide in
holiness of life. For we detest all vice and idleness; neither can
they who delight in such things be joined to our company.”</p>

<p>From this time Anscharius changed his conduct: he applied
himself to his tasks, and spent his whole time in reading and meditation,
and acquiring useful arts; so that his companions wondered at
a change the cause of which was unknown to them. As he grew in
years he was favoured with other heavenly visions, which I notice
here, because it is often said, and doubtless with much truth, that
the occupations of study and teaching have in them a direct tendency
to dry up the sources of devotion. When, therefore, in studying
the history of these ancient Christian schools we find among their
teachers a succession of saints, and even of contemplatives, who
enjoyed the most intimate communications with God, and were
distinguished by the highest supernatural gifts, one cannot but ask
wherein the difference lay; what divine secret they possessed enabling
them to keep the sweet fountain of holy tears from drying up,
so that they seem to have been wholly unconscious of the existence
of any danger to the spiritual life in the occupations of study or
teaching, and regarded such duties as in themselves spiritual.
Possibly their safeguard lay in those happy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retinacula</i> of religious
life of which St. Bede speaks, and which, as we have seen, were
regarded as their first object even by scholars like Rabanus and
Paschasius, who devoted to study only the “furtive hours” not
claimed by prayer and obedience. And hence they created a
tradition which was kept up in the Christian schools down to a far
later period, the grand principle of which was to interweave spiritual
with intellectual employment, and by timely interruptions, prevent
the whole nature from being poured out over its mental work. In
what manner this was effected in the collegiate foundations of the
Middle Ages we shall have occasion to show hereafter; it is sufficient
here to remind the reader that such a system was naturally supplied
by the discipline of religious life in those cloistered schools which
were the nurseries of Christian education. And the result was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the monastic teachers were something very unlike the modern notion
of schoolmasters; they were not mere men of the rod and the
grammar; and it cannot but strike us as remarkable how almost
universally they are spoken of as enjoying, in a very special degree,
the gift of prayer. This was preeminently the case with St.
Anscharius, and some of his visions are related by his biographer,
Rembert, who had heard them in confidence from his own lips. He
mentions one remarkable revelation received by the saint in the
early part of his religious life, whence he understood that he was to
be called to preach the faith to heathen nations. Some of these
supernatural incidents are related as mixed up with ordinary details
of his life in the schools. While he was scholasticus of Old Corby
it was his invariable custom, says Rembert, when going to and
returning from the school, to turn aside into a little oratory dedicated
to St. John the Baptist, and there pray awhile in secret. On
one such occasion when he rose from his knees he saw standing at
the entrance One clothed after the Jewish fashion, beautiful in
countenance, from whose eyes went forth a Divine light. Recognising
it to be our Lord Anscharius prostrated at His feet, but in a
sweet voice He bid him rise, saying, “Confess thy sins, Anscharius,
that thou mayst receive pardon.” “What need is there, O Lord,”
said Anscharius, “that I should tell them to Thee, seeing that Thou
knowest them all?” But he replied, “I know them, indeed,
nevertheless I would have thee confess them that thou mayst be
justified.” Anscharius accordingly declared all the sins he had ever
committed since his childhood, and was consoled by the assurance
that he had received their full remission. About the same time,
continues Rembert, it happened that one of his little scholars, named
Fulbert, received a blow with a slate from another lad, of so serious
a nature that within a few days he died. When the accident was
made known to Anscharius, the good master was overwhelmed with
anguish at the thought of such a mischance having befallen a child
committed to his care. During the time that Fulbert continued to
linger, Anscharius never left his bedside, till at last, wearied out
with sorrow and long watching, they persuaded him to take some
repose. He fell into a heavy slumber, in which he was consoled by
a gracious vision. He seemed to see the dear child carried up to
heaven by the hands of the angels, and placed in the company of
the martyrs; and, wondering at the sight, it was explained to him
that because Fulbert had borne his wound with great patience, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
had heartily loved and forgiven him from whom he had received the
injury, and had prayed much for him, accepting his own premature
death with loving submission to the Divine will, his sweetness and
resignation had deserved from the Divine compassion so great a
reward as to be placed among the holy martyrs. Anscharius was
still absorbed in the joy of this revelation when he was roused by
Witmar, a younger monk associated with him in the government of
the school, who came to tell him that even at that very moment
Fulbert had expired. He found that Anscharius already knew it,
and doubtless, adds Rembert, this comfort had been given him by
God that he might not grieve overmuch for the death of the child,
but might rather rejoice at the happy state of his soul.</p>

<p>Anscharius was one of those chosen to colonise the monastery of
New Corby, the mention of which requires a few words of explanation.
The foundation of this daughter-house was the great work of
St. Adalhard, who so soon as his young Saxons were sufficiently
trained in learning and monastic discipline, consulted them on the
possibility of their obtaining a suitable site for a foundation in their
native land. After many difficulties had been raised and overcome,
ground was procured, and the building of the abbey was begun.
Adalhard repaired thither to superintend operations in company with
Paschasius and his own brother Wala, who, brought up like himself
as a soldier and a courtier, had in former years held military command
in Saxony and won the affections of the people by his wise and
gentle rule. When the Saxons saw their old governor among them
again in the monastic habit, nothing could exceed their wonder and
delight: they ran after him in crowds, looking at him, and feeling him
with their hands to satisfy themselves that it was really he, paying
no attention whatever to the presence of the abbot or any other of
his companions. The first stone of the new abbey was laid on
September 26, 822; Old Corby made over to the new colony all the
lands held by the community in Saxony; the Emperor Louis gave
them a charter, and some precious relics from his private chapel,
and in a few years that great seminary was completed which was
destined to carry the light of faith and science to the pagan natives
of the farther North. It would be hard to say which of the two
Corbies held the highest place in monastic history; a noble emulation
existed between them, each trying to outstrip the other in the
perfection of monastic discipline. New Corby, in her turn became
the mother-house of a vast number of German colonies, over all of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
which she continued to maintain a certain superiority. A law was
made obliging every abbot of these branch-houses to keep a chronicle
of his monastery and send a copy of it to the Corby library; and by
another law, every novice on the day of his profession was bound to
present to the library some useful book. The library of new Corby
grew to be one of great value and importance, and its catalogue,
still preserved, exhibits the names of not a few Arabic and Hebrew
works. It was here also that in the days of Leo X. was disinterred
the famous manuscript of Tacitus, which may still be seen at
Florence.</p>

<p>A monastery that cared so much for the formation of its library
was not likely to be indifferent to its school. It was the boast of
both Corbies in turns to possess Anscharius as their scholasticus,
“that great preceptor,” as Mabillon calls him, for his reputation as
a master was spread over all Germany. He was at the same time
appointed to preach to the people, an office particularly agreeable to
that apostolic spirit which he had never ceased to nurture in his
heart. The time was approaching when the prophetic vision of
former years, and the secret instincts of his own soul, were to be
accomplished. In 826 Harold, king of Denmark, having embraced
the faith, and been baptized with great pomp at Mentz, petitioned
the Emperor Louis to give him some holy missionaries, who might
accompany him home to Denmark, and plant the Church in that
country. Wala, then abbot of New Corby, fixed on Anscharius, and
he, mindful of the revelation which had long before assured to him
the glory of an apostolic career, joyfully accepted the mission, heedless
alike of the criticism of friends and enemies, who all found
something to say against it. Anscharius turned a deaf ear to their
reasonings and remonstrances, and withdrew to a certain vineyard in
the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle, where he prepared for his new
duties by a kind of spiritual retreat. Here he was sought out and
discovered by a monk of Old Corby, named Aubert, and thinking
that his visitor had only come to pester him with more advice,
Anscharius bade him spare himself the trouble of arguing the question,
as he had irrevocably made up his mind. “You have nothing
to fear from me,” said Aubert, “my only reason for coming to you,
is to beg you to accept me as your companion, if the abbot Wala
can be brought to give his consent.” Anscharius joyfully welcomed
him as a fellow labourer, and they soon after set out in company
with the king. His majesty, however, was more than half a barbarian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and the equipment he provided for his missioners was not luxurious.
The royal and ecclesiastical retinue embarked on board a very dirty
boat, the only accommodation on board consisting of two miserable
cabins in which king and missioners were packed together with very
little ceremony. However, they arrived at last at their journey’s
end, and began their labours by opening a little school in Friesland,
where they received twelve children, among whom were the two sons
of king Harold himself. A little later we find them passing on to
Sweden, attacked on the way by pirates, and robbed of all their
baggage, containing their library of forty books. Such were the
humble beginnings of a great apostolate, which at its close found
Anscharius Archbishop of Hamburgh, and papal legate, not only
over the Scandinavian kingdoms, but also over Iceland and the
distant shores of Greenland, which are expressly named in the Bull
of Pope Gregory IV. One of the most successful means adopted
by the saint for the propagation of the faith, was the purchase of
young Danes who were offered for sale as slaves, and whom he then
sent to Corby, whence, after receiving a Christian education, they
returned to their own country as zealous missionaries.</p>

<p>It would take us too long, and probably prove but wearisome to
the reader, were we to examine in detail the foundation and history
of all the monastic schools of this period. Glance where we will, we
shall find indications of the same intellectual activity struggling to
make head against the darkness of a semi-barbarous age. The
schools of Hirschau, Hirsfield, Fleury, and Prom, might all be made
to furnish illustrations of the ardour with which scientific and literary
pursuits were carried on by their scholars. But while passing over
these and others, which have almost equal claims on our interest, it
is impossible to leave without notice two houses whose prëeminent
importance in the history of monastic studies has made their names
especially venerable: I mean the abbeys of Reichnau, and St. Gall.
The first foundation of St. Gall’s belongs indeed to a date far earlier
than that of which we are now treating: it owed its origin to St. Gall,
the Irish disciple of St. Columbanus, who, in the seventh century,
penetrated into the recesses of the Helvetian mountains and there
fixed his abode in the midst of a pagan population. Under the
famous abbot St. Othmar, who flourished in the time of Pepin, the
monks received the Benedictine rule, and from that time the
monastery rapidly grew in fame and prosperity, so that in the ninth
century it was regarded as the first religious house north of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Alps. It is with a sigh of that irrepressible regret called forth by the
remembrance of a form of beauty that is dead and gone for ever,
that the monastic historian hangs over the early chronicles of St.
Gall. It lay in the midst of the savage Helvetian wilderness, an
oasis of piety and civilisation. Looking down from the craggy
mountains, the passes of which open upon the southern extremity
of the lake of Constance, the traveller would have stood amazed at
the sudden apparition of that vast range of stately buildings which
almost filled up the valley at his feet. Churches and cloisters, the
offices of a great abbey, buildings set apart for students and guests,
workshops of every description, the forge, the bakehouse, and the
mill, or rather mills, for there were ten of them, all in such active
operation, that they every year required ten new millstones; and
then the house occupied by the vast numbers of artisans and workmen
attached to the monastery gardens too, and vineyards creeping
up the mountain slopes, and beyond them fields of waving corn, and
sheep speckling the green meadows, and far away boats busily plying
on the lake and carrying goods and passengers&mdash;what a world it was
of life and activity; yet how unlike the activity of a town! It was,
in fact, not a town, but a house,&mdash;a family presided over by a father,
whose members were all knit together in the bonds of common
fraternity. I know not whether the spiritual or the social side of
such a religious colony were most fitted to rivet the attention.
Descend into the valley, and visit all these nurseries of useful toil, see
the crowds of rude peasants transformed into intelligent artisans, and
you will carry away the impression that the monks of St. Gall had
found out the secret of creating a world of happy Christian factories.
Enter their church and listen to the exquisite modulations of those
chants and sequences peculiar to the abbey which boasted of possessing
the most scientific school of music in all Europe; visit their scriptorium,
their library, and their school, or the workshop where the
monk Tutilo is putting the finishing touch to his wonderful copper
images, and his fine altar frontals of gold and jewels, and you will
think yourself in some intellectual and artistic academy. But look
into the choir, and behold the hundred monks who form the community
at their midnight office and you will forget everything, save
the saintly aspect of those servants of God who shed abroad over the
desert around them the good odour of Christ, and are the apostles of
the provinces which own their gentle sway. You may quit the circuit
of the abbey and plunge once more into the mountain region which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
rises beyond, but you will have to wander far before you find yourself
beyond the reach of its softening, humanising influence. Here are
distant cells and hermitages with their chapels, where the shepherds
come for early mass; or it may be that there meets you, winding
over the mountain paths of which they sing so sweetly,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> going up
and down among the hills into the thick forests and the rocky hollows,
a procession of the monks carrying their relics, and followed by
a peasant crowd. In the schools you may have been listening to
lectures in the learned, and even in the Eastern tongues; but in the
churches, and here among the mountains, you will hear these fine
classical scholars preaching plain truths, in barbarous idioms, to a
rude race, who before the monks came among them sacrificed to the
Evil One, and worshipped stocks and stones.</p>

<p>Yet, hidden away as it was among its crags and deserts, the abbey
of St. Gall’s was almost as much a place of resort as Rome or Athens&mdash;at
least to the learned world of the ninth century. Her schools
were a kind of university, frequented by men of all nations, who
came hither to fit themselves for all professions. You would have
found here not monks alone and future scholastics, but courtiers,
soldiers, and the sons of kings. The education given was very far
from being exclusively intended for those aspiring to the ecclesiastical
state; it had a large admixture of the secular element, at any rate in
the exterior school. Not only were the Sacred sciences taught with
the utmost care, but the classic authors were likewise explained;
Cicero, Horace, Virgil, Lucan, and Terence were read by the
scholars, and none but the very little boys presumed to speak in
any tongue but Latin. The subjects for their original compositions
were mostly taken from Scripture and Church history, and having
written their exercises they were expected to recite them, the proper
tones being indicated by musical notes. Many of the monks excelled
as poets, others cultivated painting and sculpture, and other exquisite
cloistral arts; all diligently applied to the grammatical formation of
the Tudesque dialect and rendered it capable of producing a literature
of its own. Their library in the eighth century was only in its
infancy, but gradually became one of the richest in the world. They
were in correspondence with all the learned monastic houses of
France and Italy, from whom they received the precious codex, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
of a Virgil or a Livy, now of the Sacred Books and sometimes of
some rare treatise on medicine or astronomy. They were Greek
students, moreover, and those most addicted to the cultivation of
the “Cecropian Muse” were denominated the “fratres Ellenici.”
The beauty of their early manuscripts is praised by all authors, and
the names of their best transcribers find honourable mention in their
annals. They manufactured their own parchment out of the hides
of the wild beasts that roamed through the mountains and forests
around them, and prepared it with such skill that it acquired a
peculiar delicacy. Many hands were employed on a single manuscript.
Some made the parchment, others drew the fair red lines,
others wrote on the pages thus prepared; more skilful hands put in
the gold and the initial letters, and more learned heads compared
the copy with the original text, this duty being generally discharged
during the interval between matins and lauds, the daylight hours
being reserved for actual transcription. Erasure, when necessary,
was rarely made with the knife, but an erroneous word was delicately
drawn through by the pen, so as not to spoil the beauty of the codex.
Lastly came the binders, who enclosed the whole in boards of wood
cramped with ivory or iron, the Sacred Volumes being covered with
plates of gold and adorned with jewels.</p>

<p>In such a school it was no wonder that the pupils of St. Gall,
like those of Eton, became famous for their good writing. Ekhehard
I. had a method in this as in everything else; if he found a
boy dull over his grammar he set him to copy; arguing that nature
was an economist in her gifts, and did not dispense all to all; and
that often where the head was somewhat slow in learning, the
deficiency was made up by an extra dexterity with the fingers. But
boys were never employed on the Gospels, or Church service books,
these being reserved for men of perfect age, who would bring greater
care to their responsible task. We have even the copy ordinarily set
for beginners in the monastic scriptorium, a doggerel line, introducing
every letter of the alphabet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Adnexique globum Zephyrique Kanna secabant.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That the labour of transcription was often exceedingly irksome, is
evident from sundry notes scattered over these manuscripts. “As
the sick man desireth health,” writes one, “even so doth the transcriber
desire the end of his volume.” Another contents himself
with the laconic observation, “written with great trouble;” but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
third, who may be supposed to have been employed over a very
tough copy, breaks out into verse, and exclaims at his last page:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Libro completo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saltat scriptor pede læto.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The monks of St. Gall were no less famous for their music than
for their painting. Their musical tastes were inherited probably from
their Irish founders, and were further improved by the teaching of
those Roman cantors, whom we have seen in a former page sent
into France, at Charlemagne’s request, to civilise the barbarous singing
of his Frankish cantors. On their way back into Italy, one of
them, to whom the St. Gall historians give the name of Romanus,
was attacked by fever, and stopping at the Swiss monastery, was
there charitably entertained and nursed by the brethren, who had
excellent doctors among them. In return, he taught them the
Roman chant, and bestowed on them the identical antiphonarium
he had brought from Rome, making a certain case or instrument to
contain it. “And to this day,” writes Ekhehard, “if there is any
dispute about the singing, the error may be detected by consulting
this book.” Moreover, this Romanus was the first who thought of
assigning the letters of the alphabet to the musical notes, a system
which Notker Balbulus afterwards explained, and which, being further
elucidated by a certain friend of his named Lambert, was adopted
throughout Germany.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Leaving a more particular notice of the studies and students of
this great abbey for a future chapter, I must here add a few words
on another religious house, the history of which is closely associated
with that of St. Gall, and where the sciences flourished in equal perfection
under the shelter of those lofty mountains which shut out
the tumult of the world and the incursions of the barbarians. At
the western extremity of the lake of Constance, just where it narrows
towards the outlet of the Rhine, lies a green island sparkling like an
emerald gem on the unruffled surface of the waters. There, half
hidden amid the luxuriant foliage, you may still see the grey minster
of that famous abbey called Augia by its Latin historians, but
better known by its German name of Reichnau. Walafrid Strabo,
the pupil of Rabanus and the chief chronicler of his time, was abbot
of Reichnau in the ninth century, and in one of his poems has
painted its situation in very exact terms. He gives the succession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
of abbots from St. Pirminius, who first established himself in the
island in the reign of Pepin, and shows that the school was one of
the very earliest which had at that time attained celebrity. I have
already spoken of Walafrid’s fame as a master, but I cannot here
omit mentioning his pupil and biographer, Ermenric, who has made
himself known to us by a letter which he wrote after paying what
seems to have been a very pleasant visit at St. Gall’s. Walafrid had
sent him there for a holiday, and on his return he expressed the
enjoyment it had given him, in an epistle addressed to abbot
Grimoald. As soon as he crossed the lake, he says, he found himself
welcomed by a group of illustrious men. “There,” he continues,
“I found each one humbler and more patient than his fellow. I
saw neither envy nor jealousy, but all were bound together with the
triple chord of charity, simplicity, and concord. How shall I speak
of the generosity of Engilbert, or the kindness of that most clever
brother Hartmod? It would be impossible for me to do justice to
the excellence which these servants of God had attained in so many
of the arts, but you may judge of the birds by looking at the nests
which they inhabit. Examine their cloister and you will agree with
what I say. What else can I call Winhart but a second Dædalus?
or Isenric but another Beseleel? for indeed the graving tool is never
out of his hand, save when he stands at the altar to exercise his
sacred ministry. And yet there is such humility among them that
no one disdains the humblest employment, remembering those words
of Scripture, ‘the prayer of the humble shall pierce the clouds.’”</p>

<p>Reichnau, however, had its own line of great masters, among
whom Ermenric, who could do such generous justice to the excellence
of others, was himself worthy to be reckoned. The most
illustrious was, perhaps, the cripple Hermann Contractus, originally
a pupil of St. Gall’s, who is said to have prayed that he might not
regain the use of his limbs, but that he might receive instead a knowledge
of the Scriptures. He was master of Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
and Arabic; he wrote treatises on history, poetry, ethics, astronomy,
and mathematics; he calculated eclipses, and explained Aristotle,
and, in spite of an impediment in his speech, his lectures were so
learned that he had pupils from the most distant provinces of Italy.
He set his own poems to music, made clocks and organs, and was
as much revered for his sanctity as his universal genius. Many
hymns and antiphons used by the Church are attributed to his pen,
among others the <cite>Alma Redemptoris</cite>. But if Hermann was the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
famous scholar of Reichnau, a yet greater celebrity, though of a
different kind, attaches to the name of Meinrad. The story of his
vocation to the eremitical life affords an apt illustration of the contemplative
character already noticed as so frequently belonging to
the early pedagogues: and as it presents us with an agreeable picture
of a “whole play-day” in the Dark Ages, we will give it as it stands
in the pages of the monk Berno. Meinrad was the son of a Swabian
nobleman of the house of Hollenzollern, and had studied in the
monastic school under abbot Hatto and his own uncle Erlebald.
When the latter became abbot he appointed Meinrad to the care of
the school which was attached to a smaller house dependent on
Reichnau, and situated at a spot called Bollingen, on the lake of
Zurich. He accordingly removed thither, and had singular success
with his scholars, whom he inspired with great affection by reason
of his gentle discipline. He used to take them out for walking
parties and fishing parties, into what Berno, his biographer, calls “the
wilderness,” a wilderness, however, which was adorned with a
majestic beauty to which Meinrad was not insensible. One day he
and his boys crossed the lake in a small boat, and landing on the
opposite shore sought for some quiet spot where they might cast
their fishing lines. Finding a little stream which flowed into the
lake and gave good promise of trout, Meinrad left them to pursue
their sport and strolled about, meditating on the joys of that solitary
life after which he secretly pined. After a while, returning to his
scholars, he found that their fishing had been unusually successful,
and taking up their baskets, they retraced their steps to the village
of Altendorf, where they entered the house of a certain matron to
rest and refresh themselves with food. Whilst the boys ate and
drank, and enjoyed themselves in their own way, Meinrad and their
hostess engaged in conversation, and Meinrad, who was full of the
thoughts to which his mountain walk had given rise, opened his
whole heart to her. “Beyond all riches,” he said, “I desire to dwell
alone in this solitude that so I might wholly give myself to prayer,
could I but find some one who would minister to me in temporal
things.” The good lady immediately offered to provide him with
whatever he wanted, in order to carry out his design; and the
result of that day’s fishing-party was the establishment of the former
scholasticus of Bollingen in a little hermitage which he constructed
for himself out of the wattled boughs of trees. But he found himself
in one way disappointed; he had sought the desert to fly from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
world, and the world followed him thither in greater throngs than he
had ever encountered at Reichnau. The saints possess a strange
power of attraction, and neither mountains nor forests are able to
hide them. In his own day men compared St. Meinrad to the
Baptist, because the multitudes went out into the wilderness to hear
him preach penance and remission of sins. For seven years he continued
to dispense the Word of Life to the pilgrims who gathered
about him from all parts of Europe. But one day unable to resist
his longing for retreat, he took his image of Our Lady, a missal, a
copy of St. Benedict’s rule, and the works of Cassian, and laden with
these, his only treasures, he plunged into the forest, and choosing a
remote and secluded spot erected a rude chapel which he dedicated
to Our Lady, and a yet ruder dwelling for himself. There he lived
for thirty years, and at the end of that time he was assassinated in
his hermitage by some ruffians who hoped to find some hidden treasure
in his cell. His body was carried back to Reichnau, and in
after years the great sanctuary of Einsidlen rose over the site of his
hermitage, where is still venerated the image of Our Lady which he
had formerly carried thither with his own hands.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to form some idea of the real character
of these early monastic schools, and of the teaching which they
conveyed. From the eighth to the twelfth century, the scholastic
system underwent so little change, that we may select our illustrations
indifferently from any part of that period, without risk of
inaccuracy.</p>

<p>First, then, as to the schoolroom itself. In most cases the interior
or claustral schools of monasteries and cathedrals were held in the
cloisters. A strange contrast, indeed, to the luxurious requirements
of modern times; but boarded floors, patent stoves, and easy-backed
forms were luxuries undreamt of by the hardy Frankish or Gothic
students who studied under Walafrid or Rabanus. It is not until
the fifteenth century that we meet with a document hinting at the
novelty of providing schoolrooms with boarded floors.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The cloisters
of York and Worcester, now so desolate and deserted, were once
peopled with a busy race of scholars, who probably suffered often
enough, like the pupils of Bede, from stiffened fingers and bleeding
cracks. Even so late as the twelfth century, the schools of Paris
were held in the cloisters of Nôtre Dame, and only removed thence
when the repose of the canons was disturbed by the unruly crowds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
who rushed to listen to the lectures of Abelard. The number of
scholars received into a monastery varied according to its size. At
St. Riquier, where there were 300 monks, abbot Angilbert wished
never to have less than a hundred children, the sons of dukes,
counts, and kings.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> They were seldom or never left alone, and in
the cloister or schoolroom the master’s seat was so arranged, that all
were under his eye. It does not seem, however, that the surveillance
in school-hours was carried out with any excessive rigidity, for we
find frequent notice of the pranks and surreptitious consumption of
good things perpetrated by the school boys in the temporary absence
of their masters. In the dormitories, however, the discipline was
more strict; there the lamp was kept constantly burning, and though
there are no traces of an odious espionage, there is evidence of a
constant, ever present vigilance. Awaked in the morning by the
wooden signal board of the master, the children were conducted to
the lavatory by the “pedagogues” or junior assistants of the school.
These pedagogues were very numerous, and their duties were various.
Among other things it belonged to them to see to the cleanliness and
neatness of dress and person, a thing not at all despised in the Dark
Ages. At Cluny, where in the twelfth century all the older monastic
traditions of school discipline were resumed and perfected, it was not
permitted for the children to sit together on benches, but each one had
his own little box, in which he kept his writing materials, and which
also served him for a seat. A midday siesta was allowed at Cluny,
but no one was permitted to read or write on his bed.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In all these
regulations may plainly be seen a solicitude for order and good
morals, together with a certain tone of refinement, which is more
than we should expect, and which satisfies us how profoundly the
whole subject of education had been studied by the medieval
masters. Their ideas on the subject of punishment were in more
simple accordance with those of Solomon than our fastidious age
would approve. The rod, in fact, was so very generally used, that
under the form of the ferule it afterwards became the badge of the
bachelor in arts, and was solemnly delivered to him when he took
his degree. Medieval schoolboys were not more fond of a flogging
than those of later growth, and to escape it the scholars of St. Gall
once adopted the extraordinary expedient of setting fire to the
monastery. Yet with all this austerity of discipline, nothing is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
certain than that the monastic masters possessed the secret of making
themselves beloved, and that the love which they inspired was not
the less familiar because mingled with respect. I may add, that at
Cluny, though flogging was permitted, boxing on the ears was strictly
prohibited, apparently with the view of allowing no indulgence to the
irritated feelings of the master. Punishment, like everything else at
Cluny, was administered in an orderly and methodical manner; in
fact, the peculiar excellence of the Cluniacs lay in their manner of
systematising everything, whether homely or sublime.</p>

<p>The masters in most large schools were very numerous, but none
were allowed to hold any office until of mature age. At Fulda there
were twelve professors and a principal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principalis</i>), besides assistants.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
In the cathedral schools, in like manner, there was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archischolus</i>
and his assistants, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proscholus</i>, or prefect of discipline.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The
reader will perhaps smile when he hears that one of the duties of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proscholus</i> was to teach the children how to walk, bow, and behave
in presence of superiors. This, however, was a speciality of the
Canons Regular. Learning was not the only qualification required
in a master. He was to be of tried virtue. The office of teacher
was a cure of souls, and so great was the honour in which it was
held, that bishops even, who had formerly filled the post of scholasticus,
not unfrequently affixed their old to their new title, when
signing their names.</p>

<p>The education of the scholars began at a very early age, sometimes
at five or six. The first task consisted in learning by heart certain
portions of Holy Scripture, and specially of the Psalter. Even
those who very early abandoned their books for the more congenial
exercises of the tilt-yard, seldom did so till they had run through their
Psalter: “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decurso psalterio</i>,” is a common expression used in speaking
of a youth who had left school with the least possible smattering
of an education. As for those who stayed a more reasonable time at
school, they acquired, besides their profane learning, a familiarity
with the Church office and with the words of Holy Writ, not certainly
possessed by all scholars of the present day. This is abundantly
illustrated by the histories of the times. Thus Einold of Toul, sitting
at the window of his cell, hears a voice chanting the words, “I will
give you the heritage of your father Jacob,” and at once concludes
that it must be a schoolboy conning his morning’s task. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
beautiful is that story which we find in the chronicle of Monte
Cassino, of the monk Levitius, who, returning <ins class="corr" id="tn179" title="Transcriber’s Note—“from Jerusalem, came to Mount Albancta” changed to “from Jerusalem, came to Mount Albaneta”.">from Jerusalem, came to Mount Albaneta</ins>,
where he proposed to build a monastery. As
he was inspecting the site of his new foundation, he saw approaching
him a little school boy, carrying his bag of books on his shoulders,
and the thought came into his head that he would ask him if he
could sing. The boy replying that he could, Levitius told him to
sing the first thing he could remember, secretly resolving that he
would place the church under the dedication of any saint the boy
might happen to name. The little scholar thought a moment, and
then intoned the Antiphon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni electa mea</i>, which he sang with
much sweetness. Levitius listened with delight, and the monastery
which afterwards rose on the spot was dedicated to the Ever Blessed
Virgin. Scholars of all ages were very largely exercised in what one
old monk calls “the holy memory.” Learning by rote was used
more generally than among ourselves, partly because books were
rare, and all could not enjoy the luxury of a Psalter or Breviary for
private use; and partly, because the teachers of old time sought to
sanctify this power of the soul, by thoroughly informing it with holy
words. Besides the Psalter, the novices of a religious house were
expected to know the New Testament at least by heart, half-an-hour
a day being assigned for the purpose.</p>

<p>The liberal arts were, as is well known, classed under two heads,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trivium</i>, which included grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrivium</i>, which embraced arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.
This division is expressed in the well-known distich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Gram: loquitur. Dia. vera docet. Rhet. verba colorat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mus. canit. Ar. numerat. Geo. ponderat. Ast. colit astra.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The trivium, with the Ecclesiastical chant, and so much of arithmetic
as was required for the computation of the calendar, was taught in
all schools; the quadrivium only in those which embraced the higher
studies. Music was divided into two kinds, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cantus</i>, which formed
part of the routine of studies even in the lower schools, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">musica</i>,
properly so called, which included the theory of music, a knowledge
of the laws of sound, and the connection of harmony with numbers.
And this explains how it was that a knowledge of music was in those
days considered a proof that its possessor was a well-educated man:
it evidenced that he had not only gone through the elementary
studies of the trivium, but that he had completed his education in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
one of those higher schools in which the quadrivium also was taught.
And these higher schools were frequented not only by ecclesiastics
but by laics, whose inferiority to the clergy in point of mental culture
has been greatly overstated, and where it existed, was the effect of
accident rather than of system. Men who by force of necessity were
called into the field at a very early age, and engaged in active
military service during the greater part of their lives, had seldom
much time to devote to study; but there was no sort of prejudice
against their becoming as learned as they chose. Abbot Philip, of
Good Hope, who lived in the time of St. Bernard, when the institution
of Chivalry had certainly not tended to render the lay-nobles
more studious, protests against the notion that learning is the exclusive
apanage of the clergy. “Many laymen,” he says, “are well
instructed in letters. When a prince can withdraw from the tumult
of arms and business he should study himself in books just as he
contemplates his face in a mirror.” And he proceeds to speak in
commendation of the noble Count Charles who was “as prompt in
meditating the Psalms as in drawing the sword to avenge outraged
justice,” and Count Adolph “who ceased not to bless his parents
for the good education they had given him.” Of Henry, Count of
Champagne, it is said that between his warlike expeditions, when
not engaged in the judicial duties of his rank, he delighted in withdrawing
to some retired part of his castle and entertaining himself
with a classic author or a volume of the Fathers. And in the
Imperial library is still to be seen a fine copy of Valerius Maximus,
written out for him by the monks of Provins. Every one is familiar
with the name of Fulk the Good, Count of Anjou, against whose
learning Hallam has directed so uncourteous a sneer. The story,
threadbare as it is, affords too good an illustration of the subject to
be omitted. He was accustomed to sing in choir with the canons
of St. Martin’s of Tours, and when ridiculed by king Louis IV. of
France, for the habit, sent to that monarch a pithy epistle to the
following effect: “Know, sir, that an illiterate king is a crowned
ass.” “It seems, then,” observes Hallam, “that with the monkish
historians a knowledge of music passed for literature. The same
writer calls Geoffrey Plantagenet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optime literatus</i>, which perhaps
imports little more learning than was possessed by his ancestor,
Fulk.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The monkish biographer here alluded to meant nothing
of the kind, but he knew, as both Fulk and Louis also knew, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
at that time a knowledge of music might be taken as a tolerably
satisfactory token that the musician had studied at one of the higher
schools, and completed the full course of the quadrivium. And
such, indeed, was the case with Fulk, who, as the same biographer
tells us a few pages further on, was well read in Cicero and Aristotle.</p>

<p>A methodical idea of the system of education which prevailed in
the higher monastic schools, is given in a little manual called the
“Doctrinale Puerorum,” the authority of which is beyond dispute.
Though the production of the twelfth century, so little change took
place in the system of studies from the time of Charlemagne to that
of Lanfranc that it may be taken as equally descriptive of the method
followed in the ninth and tenth. According to the writer of this
manual a child as soon as he had learnt to read and write, set to
work on the Latin Grammar of Donatus or Priscian, if he were so
fortunate as to be able to provide himself with a book. The larger
number of pupils probably had to depend on the oral instructions
dictated by their master, and their own notes of his lessons. We
know for certain that not only grammar, but rhetoric and the explanation
of classic authors were taught orally, rules and examples being
thus dictated and learnt by frequent repetition. From their ninth
to their twelfth year the boys studied elementary Latin books,
specially the Fables of Esop, and the poems of Christian authors,
such as Theodulus, who, in the tenth century, wrote in verse the
miracles of the Old and New Testaments, with the view of providing
young children with suitable class-books. The <cite>Distichia Moralia</cite>,
commonly attributed to Cato, a very old class-book, was probably
the authorship of some Christian writer of the seventh century; and
has found a home even in the Eastern languages. As the boys
advanced in years, select portions from the works of Seneca, Ovid,
Virgil, Persius, and Horace, but specially of Lucan and Statius were
placed in their hands, explained and committed to memory, and
these were followed by Cicero, Quinctilian, and the Latin version
of Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Some readers will, doubtless, be tempted to regard such an account
of the ancient course of classical studies as a work of the imagination.
They will call to mind the scruples of Alcuin and the condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
passed by Paschasius on those who spent their time in the explanation
of the profane poets. But it may be observed, that the very
examples so often quoted to prove that the monks disapproved of
the study of the classics, show us that at any rate they knew a good
deal about them. Alcuin had studied Virgil himself before he forbade
Sigulf to do so, and so had St. Odo, who prohibited the reading
of the Mantuan bard, after he had seen in a vision a vessel full of
serpents, which he understood to represent his works. And the
strictures of Paschasius on those who neglected the Scriptures, while
they weighed every line and syllable of Pagan authors, shows at
least how extensively those authors were read. But it must strike
every impartial reader that these prohibitions do, in fact, prove
nothing at all as to the state of school studies. They apply entirely
to the use of the classics, not among students, but among the monks
themselves. Because it was thought undesirable that young ecclesiastics
should spend their time in the study of the profane poets, and
because their attention was rather directed by their superiors to the
cultivation of sacred science, we must not, certainly, conclude in the
face of evidence that the classics were excluded from the schools.
Teachers in the ninth century were no less solicitous than those of
the nineteenth to form the mind and the style of their scholars;
their compositions are perhaps not quite so full of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">membra disjecta</i>
of Tully as a scholar of the Renaissance might have desired, yet he
was certainly read, and though the imitations of Virgil and Ovid
attempted by these obscure writers may be very indifferent, they
could only have been produced by men who were perfectly familiar
with the original writings of the Latin poets. Mabillon has not failed
to draw the distinction between the studies pursued by monks and
bishops, and those of masters and scholars.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> He quotes two passages
very much to the point, in one of which Lanfranc declines entering
into certain questions appertaining to secular literature, submitted
to him by the monk Domnoald, because he says, “though in my
youth I delighted in such things, I determined wholly to renounce
them when I accepted the pastoral charge.” In the other passage
St. Anselm writes to his old pupil, Maurice, and advises him to read
Virgil, and the other good Latin authors, as much as he can, excepting
always such passages as offend good morals.</p>

<p>This last condition is often insisted on; nor was it until the
period of the classic Renaissance that the <em>indiscriminate</em> use of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
classics by the young was tolerated. Rabanus in his book <cite>De Institutione
Clericorum</cite>, while permitting the study of profane literature,
even to clerics, stipulates that it be read for edification, and that
whatever has a contrary tendency be put aside. The monastic
scholars even recognised that reflection of primeval tradition which
gleams through the pagan authors, and which, as Ozanam says,
opened to Virgil the schools of the Middle Ages. What they did
not allow was that the exclusive study of these models should be
suffered to paganise the Christian mind, and they contrived, therefore,
in explaining the works of Cicero or Plato to weave a Christian
tone into the lessons by connecting them or comparing them with
passages from the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Latin was the only language universally cultivated, though the
other learned tongues were not entirely neglected. Bede and
Alcuin certainly possessed a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, and,
no doubt, communicated their learning to some of their pupils.
Greek, as we have seen, was studied at St. Gaul’s, and Charlemagne,
who himself had some knowledge of that tongue, founded a Greek
college at Osnaburgh, chiefly with a view to providing ecclesiastics
whose familiarity with the language of the Eastern empire might be
of service to him in his constant intercourse with Constantinople.
Some writers whose aim it is to represent the learning of these
centuries as altogether unworthy of notice, affect to doubt whether
the Greek college, if proposed, were ever really founded; but the
evidence of contemporary historians is positive on the point. “Do
not wonder,” writes the chronicler of Ottberg, “that the abbot
of Hermann should always have carried with him a Greek Testament,
that learned man was well skilled in the Greek tongue, which he had
learnt in the Caroline college at Osnaburgh, for in that foundation all
the clergy were skilled in Greek as well as in Latin.” Louis the
Debonnaire and Charles the Bald were both Greek scholars, and the
latter monarch had a Greek and Latin glossary compiled for the
use of the Church of Laon, which he would hardly have had done
had there been none capable of using it. Florus, the learned deacon
of the Church of Lyons, was well versed not only in Greek but
Hebrew, as we learn from the following circumstance. A certain
abbot, Hyldrade, sent him a Latin Psalter, begging him to correct
it carefully, that it might serve as a copy for his monks to transcribe
from. Among the many curious and valuable monuments of
antiquity discovered by the late Cardinal Mai, is the reply of Florus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
to this request. From it we find that he had compared the Latin
version of St. Jerome with the Septuagint, and suspecting that the
text of St. Jerome had itself become corrupted by careless copying,
had likewise collated it with the original Hebrew. He quotes what
he calls “the well-known” letter of St. Jerome to two learned Celts,
pointing out the errors in the vulgar copies; but Rohrbacher
remarks that this letter was well-known only in the ninth century,
for in ours it no longer exists. The whole letter of Floras is exceedingly
valuable as evidence of the extraordinary learning and diligence
bestowed on the correction of the Sacred Text.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, an examination of the catalogues of early monastic
libraries, makes it clear that the study of Greek, if not wholly
neglected, was exceptional, and certainly did not include any extensive
acquaintance with ancient Greek literature. Among the books
named as the favourites of St. Paschasius, we find the works of St.
John Chrysostom; but in general the book collections are only rich
in the Latin Fathers. Scotus Erigena evidently introduced a novelty
when he translated the works of St. Denys the Areopagite, and the
eagerness displayed by Louis the Debonnaire to possess a Latin
version of the works of this author arose, perhaps, less from an
interest in Greek letters, than from the opinion, then finding favour
with Gallican scholars, which identified him with the Apostle of
France.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The mention, however, of any Greek poets or philosophers
is exceedingly rare. Homer, as has been said, had been brought
into England by Archbishop Theodore, and the St. Gall library
contained the works of Sophocles, but these are certainly exceptions,
and we may conclude that a knowledge of the Greek language was
a rare accomplishment, from the extreme complacency with which
the possession of a very superficial smattering of it was often regarded.
Hincmar, of Rheims, warns his nephew to avoid the foolish affectation
of some, who pick a handful of Greek words out of their
glossaries to adorn their pages and give them a learned look; a folly
too common also with our native scholars.</p>

<p>The sciences of arithmetic and geometry were probably taught in
rather a meagre form, until the genius of Gerbert, in the tenth century,
gave fresh impulse to these branches of learning. We have seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
what difficulties attended their study in the days of St. Aldhelm;
nevertheless the path of the young student was somewhat smoothed
by pleasant devices, and the Anglo-Saxon masters quickened the
brains of their pupils by problems and questions, some of which,
such is the power of tradition, have kept their places in our own
school-books. Arithmetical problems, such as the following, were
propounded to the schoolboys of Alcuin and Rabanus: “The
swallow once invited the snail to dinner; he lived just a league from
the spot, and the snail travelled at the rate of one inch a day: how
long was he before he dined?” Or, again: “An old man met a
child; ‘Good day, my son,’ he said, ‘may you live as long as you
have lived and as much more, and thrice as much as all that put
together, and then if God give you one year more, you will be just
a century old;’ how old was the boy?”</p>

<p>Besides the sciences above enumerated, some schools, and particularly
those of England, taught a certain amount of natural philosophy,
very imperfect, if compared with our own larger and more accurate
knowledge of these subjects, yet valuable in its way, as directing the
mind to a branch of learning where improvement could only be
hoped for by patient and persevering observation. Geography,
again, though in its infancy, was a favourite study with the Anglo-Saxons,
and from none did it receive greater extension than from
king Alfred, who added whole chapters to the science as it existed
before his time. This, in common with a great many other branches
of knowledge, was sometimes taught to tardy scholars by the help
of verses. Several versified summaries of grammatical rules and
geographical definitions are in existence in very early English, but
for the credit of the geographers, I will not say in what quarter of
the globe they place the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>We have yet to speak, however, of a far more important subject
connected with the early monastic schools, the religious training of
their pupils, and the sacred studies which they pursued. In nothing,
probably, did the ancient system of education differ more widely
from our own, than in the amount of vocal prayer in which children
were expected to take a part. Of course we must bear in mind when
reading of children assisting at all the Canonical Hours of the
monastery in which they were educated, that in most cases the
children spoken of were those “offered” by their parents and
intended for the monastic state. They were the pupils of the interior
or claustral schools; and it is probable that those belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
exterior school were subject to a less rigorous discipline. Still, in
either case, they were children, with the propensities common to
all children, whether of the ninth or nineteenth centuries; yet we
find nothing to indicate that the choral attendance described by the
Anglo-Saxon schoolboy in the dialogues of Ælfric, was found by
experience to be excessive. “To-day,” says the boy, “I have done
many things; this night, when I heard the knell, I arose from my
bed and went to the church and sang Night-song with the brethren;
after that we sang the service of All Saints and the morning Lauds;
then followed Prime and the Seven Psalms, and the Litanies, and
the first Mass; then Tierce, and the Mass of the day; then Sext;
and then we ate and drank and went to sleep, and rose again and
sang None; and now we are here before thee ready to hear what
thou hast to say to us.” “Who awakens you for Night-song?” asks
the interlocutor. “Sometimes,” answers the scholar, “I hear the
knell, and rise of myself; but ofttimes the master arouseth me with
his rod.”</p>

<p>If this attendance in choir surprise us as being daily required
from young children, we must remember that the habits of the grown-up
laity in early ages would be equally at variance with our own.
The Divine Office of <ins class="corr" id="tn186" title="Transcriber’s Note—“the Church was not then exelusively” changed to “the Church was not then exclusively”.">the Church was not then exclusively</ins>
recited by priests and religious; the faithful assisted even at the
Night-hours, and were constantly urged to do so. In the days of
Charlemagne, as in those of St. John Chrysostom, rich and poor, men
and women, took part in that sublime worship, and so eager were they
in their desire to join in the chant, that it became necessary for
abbots to issue injunctions, forbidding their monks to cut up their
Psalters in order to distribute the leaves to seculars who solicited
the precious fragments, certain devout women being foremost among
the beggars. Without some knowledge of the habits of the time, we
can form no tolerably fair judgment on the education which was of
course fitted and adapted to those habits. The spirit of these early
ages was pre-eminently <em>Liturgical</em>. The world was as yet
too little civilised to furnish her children with those countless
elegant methods of killing time which later ages have so marvellously
multiplied; theatres had no existence, and even the superabundant
games and pastimes so popular in the Middle Ages, were as yet
unthought of. The people sought not merely their instruction, but
their recreation also in the Church, and their education thoroughly
fitted them to join in her
ceremonies and ritual, which it is to be feared, by more cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
intellects of a later generation, are too often but very imperfectly
understood. The education of children partook, of course, of the
character of the age; it was more or less ecclesiastical, even for
those not intended for the religious or clerical state; and this has
given rise to the very hasty conclusion that in the centuries of which
we speak, education was given to none save those who aspired to
the priesthood. But in point of fact the whole atmosphere of society
was then so permeated with the Christian, and what we have ventured
to denominate the <em>Liturgical</em> spirit, that children of seculars then
received a training which, to modern eyes, appears exclusively suited
to ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>The one branch of learning, therefore, which, in the judgment of
the monastic teachers, exceeded in importance all the rest, was
undoubtedly the study of the Scriptures. “In the study of the
Scriptures,” says Mabillon, “consisted the whole science of the
monks.” Scholastic theology was as yet unknown, and the Holy
Scriptures and the commentaries of the Fathers formed the exclusive
study of theologians. That alliance between faith and reason,
wherein reason, exercising itself on revealed truth under the control
and guidance of faith, built up the dogmas of the Church into a
compact and well-ordered system, was the work of later centuries;
the monastic scholars of the age of Charlemagne knew nothing about
it. They had the Scriptures, interpreted by the Fathers, and the
decrees of the Church, for their guides in dogma; and for discipline,
the sacred Canons. With these they were abundantly satisfied.
Placed in green pastures and by the side of running waters, they
enjoyed the inheritance that had fallen to them, and sought for
nothing more. Their divines, therefore, hardly aimed at the merit
of original composition, and were content to study, to copy, and to
compile the teaching, and often the very phraseology of St. Augustine,
St. Ambrose, or St. Gregory. Hence the complaint not unjustly
brought against them, is that, though tolerably acquainted with
books, they were for the most part deficient in original argument.
In fact, they sought to hand on the traditions of the Church pure
and uncorrupted, rather than to earn for themselves a fame as
original thinkers; and one of the marks of the age is an absence of
the disputatious spirit which, if it diminishes their rank in the world
of letters, forms the charm of their characters as men. There was
nothing of the sophist or logician in those sweet and venerable
countenances, the unruffled beauty of which is so often dwelt on by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
their biographers. True, indeed, controversies did arise, as we have
seen in the beginning of this chapter, but they were out of harmony
with the time. The character of Scotus Erigena, like his learning,
was that of a man born out of due time; he belonged to the twelfth
rather than to the ninth century, and his wrangling must have sounded
strangely discordant in the ears of his contemporaries. The real
spirit of the age was one of reverence for Tradition; and the large
and active intellects of a Bede, a Boniface and a Paschasius, found
all they sought and all they desired in the Positive Theology of the
Church.</p>

<p>So much has been done in our time to dispel the vulgar illusion
that the Scriptures were unknown and uncared for in the Dark Ages,
that I need not here enter into any proof of what is now, or at least
ought to be, an uncontroverted fact. Mr. Maitland’s “Essays” have
convincingly proved that if the monks read nothing else they at
least read the Bible. But what he has not shown with equal power,
is the love, the enthusiasm with which, to use the expression of the
biographer of Rabanus, they “fed themselves on the Divine Scriptures.”
Like the Jews of old, they meditated on them, “sitting in
the house or walking on a journey;” they were written “on the
entry and on the doorposts.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> At the tables of bishops and abbots,
of nobles and of kings, the Scriptures were daily read aloud: the
little child learnt from them his first lesson, and the old man died
with their accent on his lips. What need had they of the fables of
the poets, when the beauties of the inspired writers were graven on
their memories, familiar as household words? How could they
care to listen to what Ovid had to tell them of the Golden Age, they
to whom the glowing imagery of the Prophet had painted the
kingdom of the Son of Jesse, where the wolf was to dwell with the
lamb, and the kid with the leopard, and a little child should lead
them? And what great wonder was it if the degrading tales of
heathen deities, even when sung by the Muse of Virgil, should fall
somewhat flat and profitless on their ears, accustomed as they were
to the sublime marvels of God’s dealings with His ancient people,
and the history of the Incarnate Word?</p>

<p>It was not merely as the inspired Word of God that the Holy
Scriptures were thus valued; but in the schools of which we are
speaking they held the place of the great Christian classic. They
were not a mere dry repertory of texts illustrative of doctrine, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
they formed at once the favourite book of prayer, of meditation, of
spiritual reading, and of recreative delight. Pondered on day and
night, with all their hidden meaning laid open by the comments of
the Fathers, what a treasury of wisdom, what a fountain of poesy was
there! The very language of Scripture wonderfully harmonised with
the daily monastic life, so patriarchal in its simplicity, its noble toils,
and its humble duties of the shepherd, the husbandman, and the
vinedresser. It harmonised with the scenes in the midst of which
they lived, the mountains, and the wooded valleys, the fields standing
thick with corn, the wilderness in its untrampled beauty, where rose
up “the verdure of the reed and the bulrush,” and where the myrtle
and the olive-tree grew by the running waters. It harmonised with
their deep sympathy with the Beautiful, their intimate acquaintance
with Nature in all her aspects, by day or by night, so familiar to the
eyes of those who sanctified all hours by prayer, and to whom “the
outgoings of the morning and of the evening were made joyful,” by
the Matins and Vesper psalmody. But chiefly and above all, it
harmonised with that thirst that devoured their souls for the true and
living God; a thirst which made them weary of all things in which
He was not to be found, which made all things sweet in which He
had His part; which led them by a strange inspired ingenuity to turn
all things to Him, to Christianise every study, to divinise every act;
which taught them to create new arts to deck His sanctuary, new
sciences to minister to His praise&mdash;a thirst which, unslaked by the
choicest fountains of Gentile antiquity, drank deep and refreshing
draughts at those streams of sacred poetry, out of which they framed
the language of their daily Office, and which moulded the very fashion
of their daily speech.</p>

<p>The Scriptures, then, were the Christian classics of the monks and
their pupils. Their study was not confined to ecclesiastical students,
but formed one of the chief branches of every Christian man’s education.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
And by their study we must understand, of course, not a
mere familiarity with the dead letter, but an intimate knowledge of
their spiritual sense. We may gather some idea of what was implied
in the monastic study of the Scriptures, from a letter written by a
certain monk of Citeaux to one of his friends, in which he draws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
out a compendious method for his guidance. Together with the
different divisions of his subject, he advises him to read appropriate
commentaries. Thus Josephus and Hegesippus are to be read with
the Pentateuch and the Historical Books, and if any words occur of
doubtful signification, the student is to consult the “Etymologies”
of St. Isidore, and St. Jerome on the “Explanation of Hebrew
Names;” and that other book on “Derivations,” “which is to be
found in most large libraries,” and finally the “Gloss.” Certain
passages of more importance, and summaries of the principal facts,
are to be written out and committed to memory; and the writer
proceeds to give directions on this point, adding, that on all the subjects
he names it will be useful to consult St. Augustine “<cite>De Quæstionibus</cite>.”
When the Historical Books have been carefully studied,
the Prophetical Books may be begun. We are to note which prophecies
are fulfilled, and which unfulfilled, and the exact time and
circumstances under which each was written. After these the Books
of instruction, and then the Gospels. In reading the Gospels, it
will be necessary to have St. Jerome’s description of the “Holy
Places of Palestine,” and the “Harmony of the Gospels.” And we
must carefully observe where, when, and before whom our Lord’s
Sermons were delivered, and His miracles worked. The rest of the
New Testament is afterwards to be read. The student is then
directed to read certain works on the Sacraments, on the reason for
assigning different portions of Scripture to different seasons, and
some of the works of St. Augustine. And when the literal sense of
the Holy Books has been thus carefully studied, and not before, he
may pass on to their allegorical and mystic interpretation, and read
both Testaments through in the same order a second time, special
authors being recommended to assist his comprehension of their
spiritual sense.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>This double method of study, in which the literal meaning of the
Scriptures was made the basis of interpreting their spiritual signification,
was begun very early, and even young children were considered
capable of being introduced by degrees to the spiritual
comprehension of the Sacred Books. So far from these being a
treasure sealed up to all save the clergy, they formed the foundation
stone of all education. Thus Thegan writes of the Emperor Louis
le Debonnaire, that he had been perfectly instructed in the allegorical
and mystical interpretation of the Scriptures, and we learn from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
St. Aldhelm’s treatise, “<cite>De Laudibus Virginitatis</cite>,” that the nuns for
whom he intended it were not only accustomed to read the Old and
New Testaments, together with the Commentaries of the Fathers, but
that they also studied the historical, allegorical, and analogical senses
of different passages. Nor is this by any means an exceptional case,
for in the religious houses of women sacred studies were pursued
with hardly less eagerness than in those of men.</p>

<p>And here the temptation presents itself to say something of the
schools provided in the Dark Ages for the education of women,
such as the royal house of Chelles, where the wise Bertilla presided
over scores of English scholars sent by their parents to France, as
we must needs suppose, for fashion’s sake, for there were certainly
plenty of good schools to be found in England. Fashion, however,
has much to do with the selection of a school, and Chelles was
naturally popular with the English, having been founded in the
seventh century by a princess of Anglo-Saxon blood.</p>

<p>Queen Bathildis, indeed, was not of royal birth; she was a poor
maiden who had been sold as a slave into France, and attracting the
attention of Clovis II., was raised by him to share his throne. Her
first thought in her new position was to procure the abolition of
slavery, or at least the amelioration of the condition of slaves. “She
was,” says her biographer, “of a beautiful and cheerful countenance,
to her husband an obedient wife, to the princes a mother, to boys
and youths the best of counsellors; to all an amiable and gracious
friend,” and he adds that among her other good deeds, “she was
always exhorting and encouraging the youth around her to religious
studies.” So soon as her son Clothaire was old enough to govern,
Bathildis, who during his minority had acted as regent, retired to
Chelles and spent the remainder of her days in the humble office of
infirmarian. But her foundation had meanwhile acquired a great
reputation for learning, which was yet further increased when Gisella,
the sister of Charlemagne, and the pupil of Alcuin, assumed its
government in the ninth century.</p>

<p>Nor must it be supposed that these examples of learning in the
cloisters of nuns were confined to those communities which had
caught their tone from the little knot of literary women educated
by St. Boniface. It was the natural and universal development of
religious life. We have but to glance back a century or two, and
we shall find foundations of purely French origin, those of St.
Cesarius of Arles, in which the nuns were to be seen reading even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
over their work, and busy at the transcription of the Sacred Books.
And we might quote the account of St. Cesaria’s death, written by
one of her devout children, which M. Guizot hesitates not to rank
among the gems of literature. Or we might turn to the Latin poems
of St. Radegundes, the Queen of Clothaire I., and the friend of
Venantius Fortunatus, who composed his celebrated hymn “Vexilla
regis” on occasion of the translation to her monastery at Poitiers of
a relic of the true Cross. This royal nun of the sixth century was
accustomed to read the Greek and Latin Fathers, and as her biographer
tells us, was not only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vultu elegans</i>, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litteris erudita</i>. She
liked her disciples to be as learned as herself, insisted that all should
be able to read, and should learn the Psalter by heart, and gathered
together more than two hundred daughters of noble families, in
whose company and instruction she took such passing great delight,
that, says Baudoniva, one of them whom she had educated from a
child and who afterwards wrote her life, she would address them in
the tenderest terms, calling them her light, her life, and her chosen
little plants.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The picture of St. Cesaria in the sixth century, and of St. Lioba
in the eighth, is reproduced in that of St. Adelaide of Gueldres,
abbess of Cologne in the tenth. She had enjoyed a learned education,
and took great delight in collecting around her young virgins
to whom she communicated her lessons with a truly maternal care.
Every day she showed herself in the school, and propounded
grammatical subtleties to her disciples; rewarding the diligent with
caresses, and punishing the slothful with a severity for which her
tender heart was wont afterwards often to reproach her. In fact, were
I to repeat all that her biographer relates of her zeal in the matter
of correction, I might convey the impression that the pupils of the
abbess Adelaide lived under a rather terrible taskmistress. She
sometimes visited the offenders with rods, and sometimes with a
good box on the ear. The latter chastisement was even inflicted in
choir when her pupils sang out of tune; but her biographer adds, it
was never found necessary to administer it a second time, for the
touch of her saintly hand had such power in it, as to cure all defects
of voice and ear for the future.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> But yet she was a tender and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
a loving mother, and when she had punished any one, would conjure
some of her sisters to go and console the poor victim whom she
immediately began to compassionate. Nay, her love went so far,
that besides the incessant thought she bestowed on providing her
children with good food and raiment, she would steal into their
dormitory in the winter nights, to find out if any were suffering
from cold feet, and would warm them by rubbing them with her
hands.</p>

<p>These examples are all of religious women; but we have direct
evidence that even those who embraced a secular life were
expected to receive a certain amount of education. Amalarius, of
Metz, whose great work on the “Ecclesiastical Offices” appeared
in the year 820, requires that young girls should learn the Psalter,
the Books of Job and Proverbs, the Four Gospels, and the Acts of
the Apostles. Perhaps there is no more interesting and decisive
testimony as to the amount of learning to be found among the laity
in the Dark Ages, than the curious will of Count Eberhard, of
Terouanne, who died in 860, and left behind him a precious library,
equalling in extent many of those possessed by religious houses. He
directed that this library should, after his death, be divided among
his children in the manner prescribed by his will. The four sons
and four daughters each received their share, though the boys,
naturally enough, obtained the lion’s share. Among the books
named in the catalogue are treatises on law, military affairs, history,
and natural philosophy, besides religious works.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> One of the books
bequeathed to Gisla, is the “Enchiridion” of St. Augustine. We
have besides incidental notices occurring in the biographies of the
time, which represent mothers writing to their sons and conveying to
them sound practical advice, and noble ladies keeping up a correspondence
with learned ecclesiastics, who seem to have directed their
studies. There was certainly no difficulty in the way of ladies
obtaining an education if they chose, for the convents of Chelles,
Farmoutier, Brie, and Andelys, all had excellent schools, and often
enough English mistresses, whose teaching was held in special
esteem. And Theodulph, of Orleans, does not seem to have been
giving the princess Gisella a piece of advice at all out of harmony
with the manners and ideas of the age, when he counselled her to
divide her time equally between reading and the homely cares of the
household, concluding his admonitions with the two following lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Assidue si ores, tibi si sit lectio crebra,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ipsa Deo loqueris, et Deus ipse tibi.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An attentive study of the history of the following centuries will
convince us that if the dames and spinsters of the Middle Ages were
not exactly blue-stockings, they perfectly understood the value of
Theodulph’s counsels, and that they were often not only learned
themselves, but the cause of learning in others. For not a few of
the learned foundations in England owe their existence to the
munificence of noble ladies, who, in this country at least, have ever
shown themselves the nursing mothers of polite letters. But of this
there will be more to say in its proper place.</p>

<p class="pfs90">KING ALFRED.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 873 TO 900.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of King Alfred, and his noble efforts in the cause of
learning, are so familiar to all readers that it may seem unnecessary
to say much of the restoration of letters which took place in England
during his reign. From our childhood, the stories of his life have
been as familiar to us as those of Scripture, and it is probable that
the illuminated manuscript which first tempted him to learn his
alphabet has encouraged not a few of us in our childish love of
picture-books. Every one knows that at the time of his accession
England was plunged in her darkest night of ignorance; and every
one who has studied Hume, Hallam, and other standard writers,
knows that the illiteracy of the English clergy at that precise period
is commonly cited as a sample of the state of things which prevailed
throughout Europe during the Dark Ages. Hallam, indeed, in a
note appended to his remarks on the subject, admits that before the
Danish Invasion, the churches were well furnished with books, but
adds that “the priests got little good from them, being written in a
foreign language they could not understand.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The fact that the
state of things complained of was not normal, but accidental, is
uniformly ignored by these writers; they beheld the waters of an
inundation, and would have their readers believe them to be the
ocean in its natural bed. However, far from wishing to deny the
ignorance which existed in England at the time of Alfred’s accession,
I will add to the colouring of the picture by quoting Dr. Lingard’s
brief but emphatic summary of the grievances under which the
kingdom then groaned. “At the close of this calamitous period,”
he says, after a graphic sketch of the devastations perpetrated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Danes, “the Anglo-Saxon church presented a melancholy spectacle;
the laity had resumed the ferocious manners of their pagan forefathers;
the clergy had grown indolent, dissolute, and illiterate; the
monastic order was apparently annihilated, and it devolved on Alfred,
now victorious over his enemies, to apply remedies to all these evils.”</p>

<p>The Whitsuntide of the year 873 had been signalised by the great
battle of Ethandun, gained by Alfred over the Danes; and this was
followed by a short but brilliant campaign, at the close of which the
“heathen men” retired into East Anglia and made their submission
to the crown of Wessex. This final success was succeeded by fifteen
years of comparative tranquillity, which were employed by Alfred in
those multifarious acts of wise legislation which restored order to his
distracted kingdom, and gained for himself the well-merited title of
“the Great.” No work, however, lay closer to his heart than the
restoration of learning, for though at this time quite as illiterate as
the rest of his people, Alfred’s desire to become learned had very
early evinced itself. He had learned to read and write at twelve
years old, in spite of many obstacles, no good masters being then to
be obtained in all Wessex. His reading, however, was not extensive;
it seems to have been confined to a little book in which were
collected the day hours of the church, and a few psalms and collects,
and which he always carried about him. The manuscript which by
its brilliant illuminations had first excited his curiosity was a collection
of Anglo-Saxon poetry, and there is no reason for supposing that
Alfred was at this time possessed of any other books.</p>

<p>But an intellect like his finds other food than that which can
merely be extracted from books. In company with his father,
Ethelwulf, Alfred had made the pilgrimage to Rome, where Ethelwulf
rebuilt the Saxon school which had been founded by King Ina.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
On their homeward journey he had visited the court of Charles the
Bald, and seen and talked with learned men; he had assisted at his
father’s second marriage with the Princess Judith, which was celebrated
by Hincmar of Rheims; and at St. Omer’s he had made
acquaintance with the Provost Grimbald, whose conversation left a
lasting impression on his mind. All this had been a kind of education
to him, and by showing him the superior enlightenment of other
countries, made him more bitterly regret the rudeness of his own.
The first step he took in order to begin a reform was to search out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
the few learned men still to be found among the Anglo-Saxon clergy.
How few they were he lets us know in that oft-quoted passage from
the Preface to his translation of St. Gregory, and which, after speaking
of the “blessed times” formerly existing in England, when there
were holy kings and a zealous clergy, and people came hither from
foreign countries in quest of instruction, he laments over the change
that has fallen on the land, and declares that knowledge has now so
escaped from the English people, that few priests south of the Humber
can be found who understand the divine service, or can explain a
Latin epistle in English. “They are so few,” he adds, “that I cannot
remember one, south of the Thames, when I began to reign.”</p>

<p>And yet, says Hallam, the district south of the Thames was “the
best part of England.” This, however, is clearly a mistake, for every
one of the surviving Saxon scholars whom Alfred succeeded in hunting
out and drawing to his court were Mercians. They were Werefrith,
Bishop of Worcester; Plegmund, who when the Danes were
ravaging the country had fled into Cheshire and there became a
hermit; and two other Mercian priests, named Ethelstan and
Werwulf. Plegmund was drawn out of the solitude called from him
Plegmundesham, and in 890 was chosen by God and the people to
be Archbishop of Canterbury, says the Saxon Chronicle, of great
part of which he is supposed to have been the compiler. Werefrith,
whom Asser calls most erudite in the divine Scriptures, was sufficiently
a Latin scholar to undertake the translation of St. Gregory’s dialogues.
Ethelstan and Werwulf were appointed royal chaplains, and had no
light office, for they were required by the king to read to him at every
leisure moment, “both by day and by night,” that so he might
become acquainted with books which he could not read for himself.
In Wessex Alfred found no one fitted to take part in the proposed
reform, with the exception of a poor swineherd named Denewulf,
whom he fell in with whilst hunting in the forest of Selwood; and,
charmed with the native genius he betrayed in his conversation, had
him educated, and eventually raised him to the see of Winchester.
These, however, were not sufficient for the work which the king
contemplated, and his thoughts turned to the foreign monks whose
acquaintance he had formed on his journey from Rome. He
specially desired to obtain possession of Grimbald, who was
renowned for his knowledge of the Scriptures and his proficiency in
the musical science, and for this purpose despatched an embassy to
Fulk, Archbishop of Rheims, begging that the learned provost might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
be sent to him without delay. Mr. Turner, in his interesting
account of the literary labours of Alfred, informs us that Fulk
addressed the king a very singular letter in reply, wherein he calls
both Grimbald and the English prelates who formed the embassy
by the name of <em>dogs</em>. “You have sent me some noble generous
dogs to drive away the irreligious wolves, and they came desiring
other dogs, not dumb dogs like those spoken of by the prophet,
but good noisy dogs that can bark and make themselves heard.”
Reference to the original letter of Fulk however, which is printed at
the end of Asser’s Life of Alfred,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> will show that this is a very free
translation of a passage capable of simple explanation. The
neighbourhood of Rheims was, it seems, infested with wolves, no
uncommon thing even in the suburbs of great cities in those wild
times; and Alfred, among the costly presents which he sent to the
archbishop, had included a pack of English wolf-hounds. Fulk in
his letter thanks him for the welcome gift. “You have sent us,” he
says, “noble and generous, although mortal and corporal dogs, to
drive away the visible wolves with which, among other scourges of
God’s justice, our country abounds; and you have asked of us, other
dogs, not corporal, but spiritual ones; not such as those of whom
the Psalmist speaks, saying, ‘Dumb dogs not able to bark,’ but
such as may guard their master’s house by their barking, and wisely
keep his flock from the wolves of the unclean spirit, which are the
devourers of souls, of which number one is Grimbald the priest and
monk,” whose learning and sanctity he then proceeds to extol.
Grimbald arrived in England in 884, and, after being honourably
received by Alfred and Archbishop Ethelred, is said to have made
an excellent oration to the clergy and nobility in a Synod held
at London, calling on them, one and all, to embrace a devout
life, and to lend their aid in remedying the disorders which had
followed on the Danish invasions. According to most writers, he
began to teach sacred letters in the schools opened by Alfred at
Oxford, and afterwards became abbot of the monastery which the
king had founded at Winchester. Another of Alfred’s foreign
scholars was John of Old Saxony, a monk of Corby, who has
been erroneously confused with John Scotus Erigena. He appears
to have brought with him a small community of French monks
who were placed by Alfred in the monastery newly erected in the
Isle of Athelney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>But none of these rendered Alfred such effectual help in his
literary labours as the British scholar Asser, a monk of St. David’s
monastery, whose fame having reached the King’s ears, he was
invited to the royal “vill” of Dene, in Sussex, and travelled thither
“through many wide intervening ways,” under the conduct of some
Saxon guides, in the same year that witnessed the arrival of Grimbald.
Asser, who has told us much concerning his royal patron, and has
traced his genealogy through Woden up to Bedwig, the grandson of
Noe, has been provokingly concise in his account of himself, and
the history of his first introduction to the Saxon court. We only
know that Alfred vainly endeavoured to induce him to give up his
own country, and devote himself entirely to his service; and that
Asser steadily refused to do so, thinking, as he says, that it was not
right to forsake the holy place where he had been nurtured and
consecrated for the prospect of earthly gain and honour. A compromise
was, therefore, agreed to, by which Alfred secured his
services for six months in every year; and the direction of the court
school was delivered into his hands. The plan of this school was
the same as that of Charlemagne’s Palatine academy; and in it not
only the princes and sons of the nobility, but many also of humbler
rank, received their education. They read both Saxon and Latin
books, and wrote in both languages, so that before they were strong
enough to take part in the chase and other manly sports, they were
fully instructed in what Asser calls the liberal arts. Ethelward,
Alfred’s youngest son, is specially commended for his diligence and
love of learning; and his elder brother, Edward, and their sister, Ethelswitha,
continued their studies even after they were grown up. We
have not the same accurate information with regard to the nature of
their acquirements as we have of those of Alcuin’s scholars; but Asser
says they pursued all the liberal sciences, learnt the Psalter, and read
Saxon books very frequently, especially Saxon poems. Another
school was opened at Athelney, which seems to have been exclusively
intended to educate future monks and clergy, and among its
scholars the greater number were foreigners. Asser speaks of having
seen one of the pagan youths studying there, by which expression he
probably means a Dane. He himself had no reason to complain
of not being well paid for his services, for Alfred had the merit, so
highly prized among his nation, of possessing an open hand. He
conferred on his favourite scholar the monasteries of Congresbury
and Banwell in one day; and another time gave him Exeter and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the parishes annexed to it in Wessex and Cornwall, as well as a silk
pallium and a man’s load of incense, with promises of more at a
future time. These liberal grants of land and possessions were
possibly made with the covert design of eventually fixing Asser
altogether on the Saxon side of the Severn, and not without success,
if, as seems probable, he afterwards became Bishop of Sherborne.</p>

<p>It was Alfred’s own desire to extend the blessing of education to
all his free-born subjects; and he even made it a law that every freeman
possessed of two hides of land should keep his sons at school
till they were fifteen, “because a man born free, who is unlettered, is
to be regarded no otherwise than as a beast, having, like them, no
understanding.” If they had no sons of their own, he encouraged
them to choose among the sons of their vassals those of most promise,
who might at their expense be trained in good learning, and fitted to
fill offices in church and state. He was literally dismayed at the
amount of ignorance which he found among his judges, and by his
reproofs shamed some of them into seeking in their old age for the
instruction they had neglected in their youth. “I marvel,” he would
say, “that you who have been intrusted with the office of the Wise
(Witan) should have neglected the studies of the wise. Therefore,
either at once resign your offices, or apply yourselves to gain wisdom.”
Many, urged by words like these, placed themselves under the
court teachers, and those who considered the labour of learning to
read too gigantic to be undertaken at their age, had their sons and
freed men educated, and employed them to read to them, lamenting
their own ignorance, and extolling the superior advantages enjoyed
by the youth of the present times.</p>

<p>But though the good work was begun, Alfred knew well enough
that the only way to perpetuate it was the foundation of monastic
schools; and here lay his great difficulty, for not only were all the old
monasteries destroyed by the Danes, but the religious spirit that
had formerly peopled the cloisters of Malmsbury, and Jarrow,
and Croyland, and Lindisfarne with communities numbering their
hundreds, were now entirely extinct. Asser informs us that the
monastic institute was held in such contempt at that time, that no
freeman was to be found in all Wessex willing to embrace it, and
those from other provinces who had embraced it neglected all its
rules. A gross sensuality had taken possession of the English
people, and resulted in a wide-spread neglect on the part of the
secular clergy of the sacred canons which bound them to a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
life. Their example was ruinous to the morals of the laity, and
the practice of divorce was becoming common among all ranks; and
to complete the moral degradation of the English, drunkenness was
frightfully on the increase among them, that vice the progress of
which St. Boniface had so often lamented in his letters to the English
prelates, saying that he blushed to find England alone disfigured by
a brutal habit to which the very pagans were strangers. In such a
state of society we are not surprised to find that the monastic profession
was generally regarded with dislike. Athelney had to be
peopled with foreign monks, and the murderous attempts they made
on the life of their abbot seems to show that the community was
made up of worthless members. The only other religious house of
any importance which owed its foundation to Alfred was that at
Winchester, and in consequence of the support it received from the
king it seems to have enjoyed a larger share of prosperity. Still, it
must be admitted that Alfred’s efforts to restore monasticism in
England were a failure; and in this respect his restoration of
learning differed from that of Charlemagne. The Frankish monarch
found himself surrounded by institutions which only needed encouragement
to become the fit instruments for his work. The monastic
spirit was vigorous in France in the eighth century, and he had but
to speak the word to see schools and libraries starting up in connection
with the cathedrals and monasteries. But in England the case
was far different, and hence the real good achieved by Alfred was
effected less by the schools that he founded than by the books that
he wrote.</p>

<p>It is truly astonishing to think that we should number among our
authors a king who, when he came to the throne, could barely read
and write, and who during the whole of his reign was overwhelmed
with business of all kinds, and worn down by constant bodily sickness.
If Charlemagne’s greatness had a more brilliant character,
that of Alfred is perhaps more admirable when we remember how
very few he had to assist him in his toils. He had to regenerate
every branch of government, and to see to each department with his
own eye. If Asser’s statement is to be received as literally correct,
the king found himself called on to teach his officers even their most
homely duties. In the midst of Danish incursions and daily
infirmities, he had not only to guide the rudder of the State, but to
instruct his goldsmiths and other artificers, his huntsmen, falconers,
fowlers, and dog-keepers. Many useful arts he himself taught his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
people; they were so barbarised and discouraged by their long
continued sufferings that agriculture was becoming neglected in
many parts, and the king was forced to offer premiums to those who
would apply themselves to it, and to distribute seed from the royal
storehouses. He was likewise a great builder, and introduced the
fashion of building brick and stone houses instead of wooden hovels,
himself furnishing the necessary directions and designs. I need
not speak of what he did as a lawgiver, or of the numberless social
and political institutions which he created. He was at once head,
eye, and hand to the kingdom, and found so few among his nobles
capable of seconding him in his efforts for the good of his people,
that we are told he had to hang forty-five of his judges for gross
crimes in the execution of their duty. How in the midst of all these
multifarious cares he contrived to find time for the liberal arts, is
only to be explained when we remember that he was pre-eminently
a good manager and an economist of time; not an economist in
that sense of the word in which we understand one who sacrifices
everything to business, for according to this practical view Alfred
might certainly have made more of his time than he did; and his
method of disposing of the eight hours a day which he devoted to
prayer and study, would probably by some be regarded as anything
but economical. A man who was in the habit of hearing mass and
reciting the divine office daily, and of satisfying his devotion by
frequent and stealthy visits to the church, at such times as he judged
himself least likely to be observed by his attendants, seemed to be
expending his few and precious leisure moments on duties not of
obligation. But this holy prodigality of the time given to God is a
speciality in our early Christian scholars on which it is profitable to
dwell. It formed a part of their system, and was as remarkable in
Alfred as it was in Bede. And however familiar the reader may be
with the anecdotes of his life, some, perhaps, will not be equally
familiar with them as they stand in their original garb, from which
the religious element has been carefully pared away by each successive
story-teller. I shall, therefore, make no apology for introducing
so threadbare a subject as King Alfred and his horn lanthorns,
persuaded that comparatively few of those who have heard of him as
their inventor, have ever dreamt that they had any sort of connection
with the spiritual side of our great king’s character. Here, then,
is the story as it appears in the pages of Asser. After telling us of
the many undertakings happily brought to completion by the king,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
and his incessant activity in the government of the realm, he
continues: “Having set all these things in order, mindful of that
saying of Holy Writ, ‘Let him who would give an alms begin with
himself,’ he reflected on what he could offer to God of the service
of his own mind and body, wishing to consecrate these to God as
well as his exterior riches. So he promised, as far as infirmity, possibility,
and means would permit, willingly and with all his might to
give to God one-half of the service of his mind and body, both by
day and night. However, as he could not any way reckon the
night hours, by reason of the darkness, nor equally divide those of
the day, because of the frequent rain and clouds, he began to think
how he might, with God’s help, observe the tenor of his vow even
until death. At last he hit on a useful and clever device. He
ordered his chaplains to provide a sufficient quantity of wax, which
when brought he caused to be weighed out in pennyweights. When
seventy-two pennyweights of it had been measured out, he ordered his
chaplains to make thereof six candles, all of equal dimensions, each
candle being marked out into twelve inches of length. This being
done the six candles were burnt day and night without intermission
through the twenty-four hours before the holy relics of many saints,
which he took with him wherever he went. But as sometimes the
candle would not burn through a whole night and day up to the same
hour at which they had been lighted the preceding evening (doubtless
because of the violence of the winds, which often blew through
the doors and windows of the church, or through the many chinks in
the walls and roofs, and their hangings), and as thus they burnt out
more quickly than they should have done, Alfred began to consider
how he might prevent this effect of the wind, and caused a lanthorn
to be beautifully constructed of wood and cow’s horn (for white cows’
horns carefully scraped are no less transparent than glass), and the
candle, being placed in this lanthorn, shone as brightly without as it
did within, unimpeded by the blasts of wind.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>So, then, it was in fulfilment of a religious vow that King Alfred
cast about to discover how he might accurately measure out his
time, and his horn lanthorns were but the means he hit on to help
him how to give the half of his service of mind and body, day and
night, to God. Truly a vow worthy of a Christian hero, and right
faithfully and heroically kept. Of course, in the time thus consecrated
to God, he included those hours he devoted to study, for this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
with him was a religious exercise. How, indeed, he contrived to
secure his eight hours a day of prayer and reading, is a mystery of
the same nature with those marvellous facts which we meet with in
the lives of the saints, whose days and nights seem to have had
forty-eight hours in them, if we measure them by the amount of
prayer and work they accomplished during their course. Alfred,
whilst thus disposing of his time by vow, had, as it might seem, no
time to himself. However, he made the most of what with most
men are idle moments, and when not actually engaged in business
was always reading or hearing others read. In his chamber he
always had a book open before him, and never travelled without
carrying his books with him. The attainment of wisdom, both
human and Divine, was his absorbing desire; and Asser, after
speaking of his incomparable affability and cheerfulness with others,
and the great love and honour he showed to all those whom he
drew around him, as well foreigners as natives, and his exceeding
tenderness for his own children, and for the other youths whom he
caused to be bred up in his palace, as though they were all members
of his own family, goes on to say that he had no real consolation in
any of these things, but that day and night he was devoured with
one thought, and with what he calls an anxious sadness, which he
poured out to his familiar friends; and this was his ceaseless desire
that Almighty God would make him skilled in divine wisdom and
in the liberal arts; so that he sought for wisdom even as did King
Solomon, esteeming it to be preferable to glory and riches, and, like
him, found them also together with her; according as it is written,
“Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His justice, and all other
things shall be added to you.” This coupling together of divine
wisdom and the liberal arts, as equal objects of solicitude, is easily
understood when we remember the plan according to which human
knowledge was then pursued, always in subordination to that which
is divine, and mainly in connection with it. Intellectual pursuits
not having yet been set free from their holy servitude to the faith,
were not recognised as possessing any peculiar dangers; nay, rather,
they seem invariably to have been regarded as something meritorious;
and knowledge, far from being preached against as perilous to the
soul, was ranked among those better gifts which a good man might
earnestly covet.</p>

<p>Asser has related to us the circumstances which led to the king’s
first applying himself to earnest study. Hitherto, as we have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
he had been content with making his chaplains read to him, and
when Asser first took up his residence at the Court of Leonaford, he
also was employed to read to his royal master all the books he
desired to become acquainted with, or that could be at that time
procured. “One day, as we were sitting together,” he says, “conversing
as was our wont, I chanced to recite to him a passage out of
a certain book. He listened with great delight, and showing me the
little book containing his prayers, which he always carried about
with him, asked me to transcribe in it the passage I had quoted.”
But every corner was found to be filled up, and Asser suggested
writing out the quotation on a separate leaf. “We cannot tell,” he
said, “whether we may not meet with other passages which you
may like, and if so we should be glad to collect them.” Some fresh
sheets were accordingly procured, and the same day three more
quotations were entered, and so it went on till at last the new book
was filled as completely as the old one; and this very day, being
the feast of St. Martin, 885, Alfred, then thirty-six years of age,
resolved without delay to commence the study of Latin, that he
might himself be able to read and translate books into English for
the benefit of his people.</p>

<p>His first work, of which unhappily nothing has been preserved but
a few fragments, was the very collection alluded to above, and which
Asser and William of Malmsbury speak of as his “Enchiridion” or
manual. But there yet remain his more important translations from
St. Gregory, Orosius, Boethius, and Bede, the first of which contains
that admirable preface which explains so modestly and simply the
intention of the writer, and the way in which he executed his work.
In the mere verbal translation he was assisted by the learning of
others, for he tells us with regard to his version of the “Regula
Pastoris” of St. Gregory, that it was done by him into English,
sometimes word for word, and sometimes sense for sense, “as I
learnt it from Plegmund, my archbishop, and Asser, my bishop, and
John and Grimbald, my mass-priests.” But both in this and his
other works, he was far more than a translator, and continually
expands the ideas of his authors, introducing new matter of his own;
sometimes even he substitutes whole chapters for those which he
omits, so as to make his translation almost an original work. In
the passages which are from his own pen, we admire at once the
philosophic lucidity of his thoughts and the noble simplicity with
which he expresses them. A brief sentence of Boethius is thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
expanded. “Then, said Reason, Dost thou like fair lands? and
Mind answered to Reason, and said, Why should I not like fair
lands? How? Is not that the fairest part of God’s creation? Full
oft we rejoice at the mild sea, and admire also the beauty of sun,
moon, and stars. Then answered Wisdom and Reason to the Mind,
and said, How belongeth Heaven’s fairness to thee? Desirest thou to
glory as though its beauty were thine? It is not, it is not. Knowest
thou not that thou madest none of these things? If thou wilt glory,
glory in God.... Wherefore now dost thou rejoice in the fair
blossoms of Easter, as if thou hadst made them; canst thou make
any of such things? Not so, not so. Or is it now in thy power
that the harvest is so rich in fruits? I know that this also is not in
thy power.” Boethius says, “Survey the space, the firmness, and
the rapidity of the heavens, and cease to admire vile things.” This
is enlarged by Alfred as follows: “Behold now the spaciousness,
the firmness, and the swiftness of the heavens. Yet all this is not
to be compared to its Creator and Governor. Why do ye not let
yourselves be weary of admiring and praising, that which is unprofitable?
That is, worldly riches. For as heaven is better, and fairer,
and more precious than all within it, excepting only man, so is man’s
body better and more precious than all his possessions. But much
more bethink thee that his soul is better and more precious than
his body. Every being is to be honoured in fit proportion, and
always the highest, most. And therefore the Divine Power is to be
honoured, adored, and worshipped above all other things.” The
following remarkable passage on free-will is entirely his own. “I
said, I am sometimes very much disturbed. Quoth he, at what?
I answered, It is at this, that thou sayest, that God gives to every
one freedom to do evil as well as good, whichsoever he will. Now
I wonder much at this. Then, quoth he, I may very easily answer
thee this remark. How now would it look to thee if there were any
very powerful king, and he had no freemen in all his kingdom, but
only slaves? Then, said I, it would not be thought by me right or
reasonable if servile men only were to wait on him. Then said he,
<em>It would be more unnatural if God, in all His kingdom, had no free
creatures under His power</em>; therefore he made two kinds of rational
creatures free, angels and men, and he gave them thus this great gift
of freedom.” Mr. Turner, in quoting this passage, remarks that
Alfred’s solution of the difficulty shows him to have been a true king
of the English people. He felt from his own great heart that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Divine Sovereign must prefer to govern freemen rather than slaves,
because this was his own sentiment as a king. If it were derogatory
to the dignity of an earthly ruler to have none but slaves for his
subjects, far more so would it be for the King of Heaven to have no
creatures endowed with free-will.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting of all these interpolated passages
is that which occurs in his paraphrase of Boethius, where, treating
of the duties of a king, he speaks thus in his own person: “I never
well liked or strongly desired this earthly kingdom; yet when I was
in possession of it I desired materials for the work I was commanded
to do, that I might fitly steer the vessel, and rule the realm committed
to my keeping. There are tools for every craft, without which
a man cannot work at his craft; and a king also must have his
materials and his tools. And what are these? First, he must have
his land well peopled, and he must have prayer-men, and army-men,
and work-men. Without these tools no king can show his skill. His
materials are provision for these three brotherhoods; land to dwell in,
gifts, and weapons, and meat, and ale, and clothes, and whatever else
they need. Without these he cannot keep his tools, and without his
tools he cannot work. Therefore I desired materials that my craft and
power might not be given up and lost. But all craft and power will
soon be worn out and put to silence if they be without wisdom.
Therefore I desired wisdom. This is now what I can truly say. I
have desired while I lived to live worthily, and after my death to leave
to men that should be after me a remembrance in good deeds.”</p>

<p>In his version of the Chronicle of the World, by Orosius, he
followed the same plan, and took occasion to insert a great many
corrections and additions, specially in those parts relating to geography,
a study for which, like most Anglo-Saxon scholars, Alfred
evinced a special liking. His most important additions are a description
of Germany, and an account of the voyages of Wulfstan and
Othere, the latter of whom was a Norwegian whale-fisher, who sailed
round the North Cape into the White Sea, and also entered the
mouth of the river Dwina. The narrative was taken down from
the lips of the adventurers by the king himself, and is given with
the brief biblical simplicity which marks all the compositions of the
writer. A considerable portion of the coasts of Prussia and the
Baltic are here described for the first time; neither Wulfstan nor
Othere removed the impression then prevalent that the Scandinavian
peninsula was an island, nevertheless, their discoveries added considerably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
to the existing geographical knowledge, and the industry
shown by the king in collecting and publishing these important facts
is well deserving of praise.</p>

<p>The treatise of St. Gregory on the pastoral office was translated
by Alfred with peculiar care, and his object in selecting such a work
is sufficiently obvious. It contained the instructions of that great
Pope whose name was venerated in England as that of her first
apostle, on the duties of the pastoral office, and the good king
doubtless trusted that its study would revive a better spirit among
his clergy. It had in fact a very special degree of authority, and in
all the Synods held under Charlemagne was commonly referred to
as the standard of ecclesiastical discipline, and would naturally have
a special claim on the interest of English readers, as being one of
the books bestowed on St. Augustine by the author, and laid up in
the Canterbury Library. So highly did Alfred value the translation
of the “Hirde-boc,” as he calls it, that he caused a copy to be sent
to every cathedral church in his dominions, with strict injunctions
that they should never be removed thence except for the purpose of
transcription, or for the bishop’s own reading. Three of these copies
are still preserved, with the names of the bishops inserted in the
prefatory letters; they are those belonging to Wulfsige of Sherborne,
Werferth of Worcester, and Plegmund of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Many other writings and translations are attributed to Alfred by
Malmsbury and other historians, and we are assured by the former
that he was engaged on an Anglo-Saxon version of the Psalter when
attacked with his last sickness. An Anglo-Saxon translation of the
New Testament also exists bearing his name, and was printed at
London in 1571. Indeed the literary reputation of their “darling,”
as the Anglo-Saxons popularly termed him, induced them to ascribe
to his pen any English writing of uncertain authorship. The real
part to be assigned to him in the history of learning is, in fact, that
of the founder of Anglo-Saxon literature. Up to this time few books
had appeared in the native idiom, with the exception of the national
ballads. But it was his wish to substitute that noble tongue, which
none knew better how to write than himself, in place of the incorrect
Latin which had been used by earlier scholars; his own translations
and paraphrases were the first attempts at anything like extensive
prose works in the vernacular, but from that time the number of
Anglo-Saxon writers rapidly increased.</p>

<p>I have said that the good achieved by Alfred was accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
rather by his writings than his schools. Mr. Craik, in his history of
English literature, speaks of it indeed as “probable” that Alfred
restored many of the old episcopal and monastic schools, though he
admits there is no satisfactory evidence of his having done so. We may
safely affirm, from the absence of all historic evidence, that no such
restorations took place, and the reason is obvious; to effect them he
must first have restored the monastic institute, and however ardently
he desired to do so, it is quite clear that his efforts were crowned
with very imperfect success. But his claim to be regarded as the
founder of Oxford University rests on more respectable tradition,
which, to use the words of Hallam, “if it cannot be maintained as a
certain truth, at least bears no intrinsic marks of error.” It is assumed
by most historians that the schools to the support of which Alfred
devoted one-fourth part of the moiety of his revenues, were those which
he founded or restored at Oxford, by the advice, as it is said, of St.
Neot, and where it is further stated that Grimbald taught theology on
first coming to England. Hardyng, the historian, tells us that these
schools were founded in virtue of a brief from Pope Martin II.</p>

<p class="noindent">The passage, indeed, which occurs in one manuscript of Asser’s
history, giving an account of certain dissensions between Grimbald
and the old scholastics whom he found already established at Oxford,
is now very generally held to be an interpolation of later writers, who
were anxious by this means to stretch back the antiquity of their university
to a date of indefinite remoteness.</p>

<p>For the Cambridge professors having, in Queen Elizabeth’s time,
unblushingly claimed for their founder, Eneas, the son of Brute,
those of Oxford cast about for some way of lengthening their own
pedigree to “pre-historic” times, and not content with the reputation
of having Alfred for their founder, boldly asserted that Oxford had
been a place of study for at least a thousand years before the Christian
era; and appealed to the “old scholastics” whom Grimbald is
said to have found in possession, in support of their statement. But
though the disputed passage is not to be found in the more authentic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
manuscripts of Asser, yet in them he makes mention of certain
schools founded by Alfred, the locality of which he does not name,
and there seems no solid ground for rejecting the tradition that fixes
them at Oxford, and represents Grimbald as exercising there the office
of teacher. The same tradition assigns St. Peter’s Church as the scene
of his labours, and the Saxon crypt of that church, which is beyond
all doubt one of the highest antiquity, is commonly called St. Grimbald’s
crypt, and is said to have been built by him and intended as
his own place of sepulture. But even granting thus much to the
Oxford antiquarians it is evident that the circumstantial account
which represents the university as founded by Alfred in the same
regular form which it assumed in the thirteenth century is altogether
fabulous. And it must be allowed that national pride has considerably
overstated the work achieved by Alfred as a reviver of learning,
and a reformer of discipline. How small an improvement had taken
place in the general tone of the Anglo-Saxon clergy may be gathered
from the severe reproof addressed to them in the following reign by
Pope Formosus, in which it is declared that the impieties of paganism
had been suffered to revive in England, while the bishops “remained
silent like dogs unable to bark.” Such a deplorable state of things
can in no way be attributed to any negligence on the part of Alfred,
but as he himself has told us, “without tools no man can do his work,”
and in his day the right tools were wanting. Hence, though several
of his successors inherited his learned tastes, they were able to accomplish
but little for the promotion of letters. Edward the Elder is
said to have founded or restored some schools at Cambridge, and
Athelstan is not only styled a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">doctarum artium amator</i>, but is even to
be numbered in our list of royal authors, some of his books being
discovered by Leland in the library of Bath abbey. But the renewed
incursions of the Danes, and the continued wars in which these
princes were engaged, prevented their devoting much attention to
the encouragement of literature, and, as Wood expresses it, the drum
of Mars forced Minerva into a corner. The dearth at this time of
monastic houses, and consequently of schools, is proved by the fact
that the very few Englishmen who were attracted to a religious life
either chose the eremitical state, or emigrated to the foreign cloisters
of Fleury or Montfaucon. But in England the old sanctuaries of
learning and piety were suffered to lie desolate. The collegiate
clergy formerly attached to the cathedrals were exchanged for secular
canons, and in the reign of Edgar the Peaceable, that monarch was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
able to affirm, as a fact known to all men, that, under the rule of his
predecessors, monastic institutes had entirely decayed.</p>

<p>The only surviving establishment that still kept up something like
a monastic school was the little colony of Irish clergy who served
the church of Glastonbury, and it was here that the rudiments of
education were received by that extraordinary man who was destined
to restore the monastic institute in England, and thus to become the
author of a revival of learning more real and lasting than that which
Alfred had attempted. This was a work demanding something more
than royal power and human greatness for its accomplishment; it
implied a struggle with the corrupt sensualism of the world, and a
conquest of those powers of evil which are not to be cast forth save
by prayer and fasting. A spirit had to be breathed into the dry
bones, and the dead, in a certain sense, to be raised to life; and all
this called for nothing less than the ministry of a <em>saint</em>. And in the
hour of the darkest need, a saint was granted to the English Church,
which had for more than a century borne the curse of sterility. Or
rather not one, but a cluster of glorious stars suddenly illuminated
her clouded heavens, whose labours, if they were primarily directed
to the reform of ecclesiastical discipline, embraced at the same time,
and as a necessary means for accomplishing that end, the establishment
of monasteries and schools.</p>

there be any spot in England consecrated alike by sacred and poetic
traditions, it is surely the “thrice famous isle” of Glastonbury,
where, according to common belief, the faith was first planted
in Britain by St. Joseph of Arimathea, and which was regarded by
the inhabitants of this island with a veneration which induced a
vast number of the British saints who flourished before the Saxon
conquest to retire before their death to the Glassy Isle, that their
dust might mingle with its sacred soil. Still surrounded by the
marshy waters which once formed a glassy lake around it; still made
beautiful in spring by the apple blossoms to which it owes its poetic
name of Avallon; still preserving that mysterious hawthorn-tree
which, like the roses of Pœstum, “boasts its double bloom,” and marks
the spot where our first apostle struck his staff into the ground;
and still covered with the ruins of that noble abbey which kings vied
with one another in beautifying and enriching as “the fountain and
origin of all religion in the realm of Britain,”&mdash;Glastonbury
might well claim, even in its present desolation, to draw pilgrims
to its ruined shrines. The poet wanders there to weave new Idylls
over the grave of Arthur, whilst the devout client of our native
saints kneels to kiss the soil which was the cradle of St. Dunstan.
And some may even recall the thought of days long since fled away
into the haze of the past, when those two names, so rich in legendary
lore, were first cast like golden grains into the storehouse of their
memory, as they stood rapt in childish wonder amid those venerable
walls, and there taking root, gave birth in their souls to a new
idea, so that they passed out of the ruins of Glastonbury, believers,
for the first happy moment of their lives, in the possibility of an
heroic life.</p>

<p>Glastonbury was at once the birthplace of St. Dunstan and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
nursery of his greatness in riper years. There as an infant he was
offered by his parents at the altar of Our Lady, and so soon as he
could prattle, was given over by them to the care of some Irish
monks who had settled in the deserted abbey, and earned a scanty
subsistence by educating the children of the neighbourhood. His
extraordinary genius soon displayed itself, not merely by a rapid
acquisition of grammar, but by the excellence he attained in music,
poetry, and the arts. Having been introduced to the notice of the
king by his uncle Athelm, Archbishop of Canterbury, his superior
talents excited the jealousy of the courtiers, who accused him of
magic, a charge which they chiefly grounded on his musical skill, by
which they declared that he bewitched the king, and his familiarity
with the old bardic poetry of the Anglo-Saxons. Obliged to withdraw
from court, he returned to Glastonbury, and for some time led
an eremitical life in a small cell adjoining the church. We need
neither the testimony of the old legend, nor the suggestions of
romance, to understand how it was that a mind like Dunstan’s had
to pass through much tribulation ere it could utterly resign itself
to the guidance of grace. The noblest natures have the hardest
combats to undergo, and are not crowned till they have striven and
overcome. So it was in the midst of many trials that Dunstan spent
his solitary noviciate, chasing away the tempter now with prayer, and
now with manual labour. He did not lay aside his artistic tastes,
but toiled away at his smith’s forge, producing those exquisite works
in gold and other metals long preserved with reverence in many
English churches, or carving in wood, or painting, engraving, and
moulding in wax and clay. He used his musical skill, too, to soothe
his weary spirit, by reminding himself of the heavenly harmonies,
and once, having hung his harp against the wall, the wind, it is said,
swept over the strings, and brought out from them a plaintive strain
in which he recognised one of the antiphons sung in the Common
of Martyrs, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gaudent in cælis animæ sanctorum qui Christi vestigia
secuti sunt</i>. At last King Edmund, the brother and successor of
Athelstan, recalled him to court, made him his chief councillor, and
bestowed on him the territory of Glastonbury, that he might restore
the abbey to its former splendour. Dunstan therefore collected a
community, to whom he gave the rule of St. Benedict, and according
to many writers he is to be regarded as the first real founder of
the Benedictine order in this country. Even if this be an historical
error, and the early Anglo-Saxon monks may likewise be claimed as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Benedictines (a warmly controverted point on which it is needless here
to enter), St. Dunstan’s work as the restorer of the order is of no less
importance than if we consider him the first English founder, for the
firm establishment of the monastic rule in England at this particular
juncture was the means by which, under God, the Church itself was
preserved in this land.</p>

<p>The corruption of the secular clergy had become so general that
the total decay of religion must soon have been the inevitable result,
had not sacred letters and ecclesiastical discipline been revived by
the monks. Happily, St. Dunstan was not alone; he found a band
of great souls, able and willing to second him in his efforts, and
among these were the three saints, Odo, Oswald, and Ethelwold.
Odo was the son of Danish and heathen parents, who, disgusted
at their son’s interest in everything connected with the Christian
worship, turned him adrift, while still a child, to shift for himself.
Athelm, one of King Alfred’s thanes, took compassion on him, and
sent him to be educated at the court school, where, we are told, he
acquired so thorough a knowledge both of Greek and Latin as to be
able to write in both languages with great facility. Being promoted
to the priesthood, Athelm chose him for his confessor, and, according
to the custom of the more pious laity of early times, recited the
divine Office with him daily. After that he became chaplain to the
good king Athelstan, in which capacity he was present at the great
battle of Brunanburgh. Athelstan procured his election to the see
of Sherburne, whence, in 942, he was translated to the archbishopric
of Canterbury. He hesitated to accept the primacy, however, on
the ground that he was not a monk, as all those had been who had
preceded him in that see. But the king overruled the objection by
sending to the abbot of Fleury, who himself brought over the
monastic cowl with which he invested the archbishop elect. Odo
at once addressed himself to the Augean task of reform, and
appointed his nephew, Oswald, to the deanery of Winchester, hoping
thereby to introduce more regular discipline among the canons of
that cathedral. But Oswald found his efforts so utterly fruitless that
he withdrew to Fleury, whence, however, he was compelled to return
at the command of his uncle, who could ill spare labourers from the
English vineyard. The archbishop’s canons, together with the
pastoral letter which accompanied them, bear evidence alike of his
zeal and his learning. But something more than a paper reform was
required to heal the terrible wounds of the English Church. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
only real hope of remedy lay in the formation of an entirely new
body of clergy, who should from their youth have been trained in
sacred letters, holy living, and ecclesiastical discipline. Church
seminaries were needed; and where could these be established save
in the newly-founded abbeys now springing up under the government
of St. Dunstan?</p>

<p>The destruction of the monastic schools had been one chief cause
of the existing evils, and in their restoration Odo saw the only hope
of remedy. And, marvellous to say, they were being restored. At
Glastonbury St. Dunstan had already founded the first regular
monastic school which had been seen in England since the destruction
of her old seminaries; and here some of the most famous
ecclesiastics who flourished during the tenth century received their
education. Dunstan allowed the reading of the Latin poets, because,
as he said, it polished the mind and improved the style; he also
encouraged the study of Anglo-Saxon poetry, as it would seem with
a view of rendering his clergy eloquent in the vernacular tongue,
and more powerful preachers. Neither was science forgotten; and
the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music were carefully
cultivated by his pupils, many of whom likewise excelled in
those artistic pursuits in which their master was an adept. Nor
was Glastonbury the only scene of this revived intellectual activity.
The combined influence of great genius and great sanctity was
effecting that reaction in favour of monasticism which Alfred had
vainly attempted to bring about, and to which he also had looked
as the only means of establishing a real reform. In his time monks
had sunk so low in the estimation of the Anglo-Saxon people, that
none but churls could be found willing to wear the cowl. But St.
Dunstan’s example had turned the tide, and Glastonbury was soon
able to send out colonies and found other houses, whose abbots were
supplied from the ranks of the saint’s chosen disciples.</p>

<p>Among these, by far the most distinguished was St. Ethelwold,
who, after for some years filling the office of dean in the monastery
of Glastonbury, formed the design of passing over to Fleury in order
to perfect himself more thoroughly in religious discipline and sacred
science. King Edred, who was then reigning during the minority
of his two nephews, heard of his purpose and forbade him to leave
the kingdom, but, to sweeten his disappointment, offered him the
old ruined abbey of Abingdon, that he might restore the monastic
rule within its walls. He was right in thinking that such an offer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
was likely to reconcile Ethelwold to his detention on the English
soil, and the saint at once applied himself to his labour of love. He
began by sending over to Corby for some monks well-skilled in
monastic discipline, whom he desired to have as foundation stones
of his community; and, not content with this, he despatched one of
his brethren from Glastonbury to study all the ways and fashions of
that celebrated seminary of learning. Ethelwold had nothing more
at heart than the restoration of sacred studies, and was resolved that
his monastic school should be the best of its kind. Wolstan, his
biographer, tells us that he had been the companion of St. Dunstan
in his studies, and not only distinguished himself by his proficiency
in grammar, poetry, and the mechanical arts, but had also spent
several years in the work of teaching others. “He taught the art of
grammar with great skill,” says his disciple, “and that of poetical
metre with most mellifluous sweetness; and like the prudent bee
which is used to seek for pleasant scents flying about among the
trees and flowers, and agreeably loading itself with the odoriferous
juices, even so did he pluck the blossoms of the sacred volumes,
and studiously apply himself to the study of the Catholic Fathers.”
He was, moreover, like his master Dunstan, an enthusiastic lover of
science, and a great adept in architecture and bell-founding; and
thus the restoration of the old abbey was one of those undertakings
in which his piety and his taste were able to work in concert. The
new abbey church was adorned with four large bells, two cast by the
hand of its abbot, and two yet larger ones, the handiwork of St.
Dunstan. Nor was Ethelwold less renowned as a musician and
mathematician, and one of his mathematical treatises, addressed to
the celebrated Gerbert, is still preserved in the Bodleian Library.
He had, moreover, that yet more excellent gift, the power of engaging
the affections of those whom he taught. The young were
irresistibly attracted to him, and this was one cause of the influx of
youths who soon filled the schools of Abingdon. The account has
been preserved of the death of one of his scholars, an innocent boy
named Ædmer, who was greatly loved both by the abbot and his
schoolfellows, on account of his holy simplicity and angelic virtue.
Whilst still in the happy state of baptismal grace he was attacked by
mortal sickness. As his death drew on he was rapt in ecstasy, and
beheld the Blessed Virgin seated on a glorious throne surrounded
by many saints. With a kind and loving countenance, she asked
him whether he would prefer remaining amid that heavenly company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
or continuing in his mortal life. And he, seeing no sadness among
those on whom he gazed, said he would far rather abide there with
them; whereupon Our Lady promised that he should have his wish.
And so, returning to himself, he made known to the abbot what he
had seen and heard; and presently his happy soul departed to its
rest.</p>

<p>In the reign of the dissolute Edwy, a storm arose which for a time
threatened to overthrow the new foundations, and put a stop to the
good work so happily begun. The courageous reproof administered
to that prince by the abbot of Glastonbury having exposed him to
the royal displeasure, he was obliged to withdraw to Flanders, and
the two abbeys of Glastonbury and Abingdon were dissolved by the
king’s command, and the monks dispersed through the country.
The vices of Edwy, however, brought their own punishment with
them: the provinces north of the Thames threw off his authority,
and chose for their king his brother Edgar, who at once recalled St.
Dunstan, and promoted him to the same post of confidence he had
filled under Edmund and Edred. The see of Worcester falling
vacant, Edgar, who by the death of Edwy was now king of all
England, insisted on his accepting the episcopal charge, and he was
accordingly consecrated by St. Odo, in 957. Two years later, on
the death of the primate, Dunstan was chosen his successor, and
going to Rome to receive the Pall, was sent back to England invested
with the authority of Apostolic Legate.</p>

<p>He was now in a position effectually to carry out those great
measures of reform for which he had so long been preparing the
instruments. He found himself surrounded by a band of faithful and
carefully-trained ecclesiastics, animated with his own devoted spirit;
and his first step was to procure the election of Oswald, the nephew
of Odo, to the see of Worcester. Ten years later, St. Oswald became
Archbishop of York, being allowed, by extraordinary dispensation, to
hold both sees together; Dunstan being unwilling that the good
discipline he had established at Worcester should suffer by his
removal. Ethelwold was placed over the see of Winchester, and,
with the help of these two holy coadjutors, the archbishop entered
on the task of enforcing the observance of the sacred canons. The
royal sanction to his plan was formally granted at a great council, for
Edgar entered heart and soul into all the plans of his primate. “I
hold the sword of Constantine,” he said, “and you that of St. Peter;
together we will purify the sanctuary.” The choice was everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
offered to the secular clergy of promising obedience to the laws of
the Church, or resigning their benefices. In some places the secular
canons accepted the reform, but where they refused to do so they
were summarily ejected. St. Oswald was fortunate enough to succeed
in winning his Worcester canons, not merely to promise a
regular life, but to embrace the monastic rule; and, under his wise
and gentle government, they in time became excellent religious. St.
Ethelwold was less happy; and finding it impossible to convert his
canons from their life of lawless indulgence, he replaced them with
a body of Benedictine monks.</p>

<p>At the same time that many cathedrals and collegiate churches
were receiving these monastic colonies, new foundations were everywhere
springing up. Ely, Peterborough, Malmsbury and Thorney
abbeys rose once more out of their ruins; and such was the eagerness
of the king and his nobles to promote the ecclesiastical reform,
that more than forty abbeys were founded or restored during the
primacy of St. Dunstan. With these events, however, so important
in the Church history of England, we are only concerned in so far
as they affected the restoration of learning; and, in fact, the revival
of the monastic institute was one and the same thing with the revival
of the English schools. From this time, in spite of many corruptions
and abuses, which resisted even the efforts of Dunstan to remove
them, the Dark Age, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par excellence</i>, of English history began to disappear.
A new race of scholars sprang up in the restored cloisters,
some of whom were not unworthy to be ranked with the disciples of
Alcuin and Bede. St. Dunstan himself, during the remainder of his
primacy, was occupied with measures rather of practical, than of
educational reform; nevertheless, we find from his canons that his
solicitude was directed in a very special way to providing for the
religious instruction of the common people. He revived the old
parochial schools, and obliged his parish priests to preach every
Sunday to their flocks, requiring them also in their schools to teach
the children of their parishioners grammar, the church-chant, and
some useful handicraft trade.</p>

<p>It was St. Ethelwold, however, who exhibited the greatest zeal for
the restoration of sacred studies. He loved the work of teaching for
its own sake, and had no sooner got possession of his own cathedral,
and banished the canons who had so long disgraced it, than he
applied all his care to collect and educate a staff of young clergy,
who, he trusted, would prove worthy to fill the vacant benefices.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
“It was ever sweet to him,” says his charming biographer Wolstan,
“to teach youths and little ones, to explain their Latin books to them
in English, to instruct them in the rules of grammar and prosody,
and allure them by cheerful words to study and improvement.
And so it came to pass that many of his disciples became priests
and abbots, some also bishops and archbishops, in the realm of
England.” Among these was St. Elphege, who afterwards became
Archbishop of Canterbury, and was martyred by the Danes, and
Cynewulf, abbot of Peterborough, an apt and gentle teacher, whose
monastic school was so celebrated that, as Hugo Candidus says,
scholars flocked to it from all countries as to the court of a second
Solomon. He wrote some Anglo-Saxon poems, still preserved; their
authorship being detected by the curious insertion here and there
of a Runic letter, which, when put together, spell the writer’s name.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the new race of scholars did not exclusively
cultivate Latin literature. The labours of Alfred had given a
powerful stimulus to the study of English, and this was yet further
encouraged both by St. Dunstan and St. Ethelwold, who desired
nothing more than to facilitate the instruction of the common people
in their own tongue. Ethelwold translated the rule of St. Benedict
into Anglo-Saxon for the use of his monks, and a copy of this work
may still be seen in the Cottonian Library, the Latin text being
accompanied with an interlinear Anglo-Saxon version. Elfric, one
of Ethelwold’s scholars, devoted himself with particular energy to
the cultivation of English literature. Besides translating a considerable
number of the books of Scripture, at the request of his friend,
the ealderman Ethelward, he composed a Latin and English grammar,
and other school books, such as a Latin and English glossary, and
his well-known “Colloquies,” written in both languages, for the use
of beginners. The grammar has a Latin and English preface, in
which he tells us that he undertook the work for the promotion of
sacred studies, specially among the young, for, he observes, “it is
the duty of ecclesiastics to guard against such a want of learning in
our day as was to be found in England but a very few years ago,
when not a priest could be found to translate a Latin epistle, till
Archbishop Dunstan and Bishop Ethelwold encouraged learning in
their monasteries.”</p>

<p>His most celebrated work was his collection of Homilies<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
use of parish priests. None are original compositions; they are
selections and translations from the early Latin Fathers, as well as
from Bede and a few other French and German homilists. The
Anglo-Saxon into which they are rendered is considered the fairest
specimen that can be cited of our ancient national tongue, and raises
a regret that so noble a language should ever have been allowed to
corrupt into our modern hybrid English. The compiler subscribes
his name to the work as, “Ælfric, the scholar of Ethelwold,” a title
he evidently regarded as no small honour. I may add, that many
of his writings are addressed to his friend Ethelward and another
English thane, Sigwerd of East Heolen, and seems to intimate
that the laity as well as the clergy were now beginning to cultivate
letters.</p>

<p>Ethelwold’s zeal for the restoration of the monastic institute moved
him to petition King Edgar for a grant of all the minsters that had
been laid waste in old time by the “heathen men.” It would be
too long to notice all the restoration effected by “the father of
monks” as he was called, or the many works of active benevolence
which earned for him, from his grateful people, his other beautiful
title of “the well-willing bishop.” He exercised his engineering
talents in supplying his cathedral city with water, and in time of
dearth broke up his altar plate to feed the multitudes. He rebuilt
his cathedral church with great splendour, as we learn from the poem
in which Wolstan has dwelt with loving minuteness on every detail
from the crypt to the tower, which last was surmounted by a gilded
weathercock, which says the poet, “stands proudly superior to the
whole population of Winton, and brazen as he is, rules all the other
cocks of the city.” There was likewise an organ of marvellous construction,
and a certain wheel full of bells, called “the golden
wheel,” only brought out on solemn occasions, both of these being
the workmanship of the bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, St. Oswald was pursuing much the same course in his
northern dioceses. He restored the abbeys of Pershore, Winchecombe,
and St. Alban’s, and founded several others, particularly
that of Ramsey, which long maintained the reputation of being the
most learned of the English monasteries. The history of its foundation
is given at length by the monk of Ramsey. A certain ealderman,
named Aylwin, having offered to devote his wealth to some work of
piety, St. Oswald asked him if he had any lands suited for the building
of a monastery. He replied that he had some land, surrounded
with marshes, and free from resort of men, and there was a forest
near it full of various kinds of trees, and having several spots of
good turf and fine grass for pasturage. They went together to view
the spot, which was so solitary and yet possessed of so many conveniences
for subsistence and secluded devotion, that the bishop
decided on accepting it. Artificers of all kinds were at once collected,
and the neighbours willingly offered their services. Twelve monks
from another cloister came to form the new foundation; their cells
and a temporary chapel were first raised, and by the next winter they
had provided iron and timber enough for a handsome church. In
the spring a firm foundation was made in the fenny soil, the workmen
labouring as much from devotion as for profit. Some brought the
stones, others made the cement, and others worked the wheel-machinery
that raised the stones to their places, and so in a short
time the sacred edifice, with two fair towers, appeared in what had
before been a desolate wilderness.</p>

<p>The monks mentioned in this account as having been brought
from “another cloister,” were a colony from Fleury, and among
them was the celebrated Abbo of Fleury, of whom there will be
occasion to speak in another chapter. He remained two years at
Ramsey, and thoroughly established its school. His most distinguished
pupil was Bridferth, originally a monk of Thorney, who
migrated to Ramsey soon after its foundation, and was probably one
of the first scientific scholars of his time. He had received his
early education from St. Dunstan, and imbibed all his tastes. In
his Commentary on Bede he incidentally notices a scientific observation
which he had made when a student at Thionville in France,
whence it appears that he had enlarged his stock of knowledge by
visits to foreign academies. His Commentaries on the treatises
De Rerum Natura and De Tempore, consist of notes of lectures
delivered in the Ramsey schools. Whilst explaining his author he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
frequently introduces original illustrations, sometimes supporting
Bede’s statements by numerical calculations of his own, sometimes
amplifying the text and clearing up doubtful expressions. He quotes
St. Clement, St. Augustine, Eusebius, St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, and
St. Isidore, also Pliny, Macrobius, Priscian, and Martian Capella,
and continually refers to the Latin poets as familiar to his hearers.
He was also the author of a treatise “De Principiis Mathematicis,”
and a life of his old master. St. Dunstan, the last of which he
dedicated to Ælfric, and extols him in his preface for the “enormity
of his well-known learning.”</p>

<p>The later annals of Ramsey abbey are full of interest, and how
that the school thus brilliantly founded was not suffered to fall into
decay. Some of these will reappear in a later portion of our narrative;
but, before bidding adieu to the old Saxon abbey, I must
notice one little narrative which shows that all the scholars there
educated were not destined for the ecclesiastical state. Four little
boys named Oswald, Etheric, Ædnoth, and Athelstan had been
placed in the school by St. Oswald, all being sons of powerful
Saxon thanes. They were received before they were seven years old,
and were of innocent manners and beautiful countenances. At certain
times they were suffered by their master to go and play outside
the cloister walls. One day, being thus sent out by themselves, they
ran to the great west tower, and laying hold of the bell rope, rang
with all their might, but so unskilfully that one of the bells was
cracked by the unequal motion. The mischief becoming known, the
culprits were threatened with a sound flogging; a threat which occasioned
abundance of tears. At last remembering the sentence they
had so often heard read from the rule of St. Benedict, “If any one
shall lose or break anything, let him hasten without delay to accuse
himself of it,” they ran to the abbot and, weeping bitterly, told
him all that had happened. The good abbot pitied their distress,
and calling the brethren together who were disposed to treat
the matter rather severely, he said to them, “These innocents
have committed a fault, but with no evil intention; they ought,
therefore, to be spared, and when they grow up to be men it will
be easy for them to make good the damage they have done.”
Then, dismissing the monks, he secretly admonished the boys,
how to disarm their anger, and they, following his directions, entered
the church with bare feet, and there made their vow; and when
they grew up to manhood and were raised to wealth and honour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
they remembered what they had promised, and bestowed great
benefits on the church.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Not the least benefit conferred <ins class="corr" id="tn223" title="Transcriber’s Note—“by the monks on their count” changed to “by the monks on their countrymen”.">by the monks on their countrymen</ins>
by the foundation of these abbeys was the improvement of the lands
which they drained and cultivated. This, indeed, does not properly
enter into our present subject; but the graphic pictures which
monkish historians have left of the spots which they thus tamed and
beautified, must be referred to as showing that their minds and tastes
were no less richly cultivated. It is thus that William of Malmsbury
speaks of Thorney abbey after its restoration by St. Ethelwold, who
took great pains in planting it with forest and fruit trees: “Thorney,”
says the historian, “is indeed a picture of paradise, and for pleasantness
may be compared to heaven itself, bearing trees even in the
very fens, which tower with their lofty tops to the clouds; while
below, the smooth surface of the water attracts the eye and reflects
the verdant scene. Not the smallest spot is here unimproved&mdash;all
is covered with fruit trees or vines, which creep along the ground,
and in some places are supported on poles.”</p>

<p>But it remains for us to speak of the death of those great men,
whose successful labours had effected so much for the real civilisation
of their country. Ethelwold was the first to depart; and four
years later, in 988, St. Dunstan terminated his grand career, rapt,
as it would seem, in an ecstasy of love; for, after receiving the Holy
Viaticum, he poured out a sublime prayer, and expired with its accents
on his lips. St. Oswald survived his two friends until the February
of 992; and among all the beautiful narrations of the deaths of the
saints, “precious in the sight of the Lord,” few can be found more
touching than that which describes his end. On the day previously,
coming out of his oratory into the open air, he stood for a while
gazing up into the sky, as though fixedly contemplating some glorious
sight. Being asked what he saw, he only smiled, and said he was
looking at the place whither he was going. He then returned to his
oratory and desired them to give him the Holy Unction and the
last Viaticum, although, indeed, he had no appearance of illness.
That evening he assisted at the night office in his cathedral, and
when morning came, according to his custom, he washed the feet of
twelve poor men, reciting as he did so the Gradual Psalms. At their
close, still kneeling, he pronounced the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria Patri</i>, and then,
bending gently forward, expired at the feet of the poor. When his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
holy body was carried to the grave, a milk-white dove, with wings
extended, hovered over the bier all the way. He had been granted
the satisfaction of witnessing the completion of his favourite abbey of
Ramsey, which he consecrated just three months before his death.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The English restoration of letters, inaugurated by St. Dunstan
and his companions, took place at a critical period, when fresh tides
of barbarism were overwhelming the continental territories, and
reducing the monastic institute in France to its very lowest ebb.
This tenth century was, in fact, the famous “Age of Iron,” which,
in spite of its celebrity as the very midnight of the Dark Ages, fills,
strange to say, a very important place in the history of monastic
literature. It will, therefore, be necessary to consider its various
bearings at some length; and we will begin with the ungracious task
of painting it in its blackest aspect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baronius</span>, when about to enter on the history of the tenth century,
thinks it necessary to prepare his readers for what is coming by a
sentence which, in spite of the wildness of its metaphors, has
obtained an odd kind of immortality. “We are now entering on a
period,” he says, “which for its sterility of every excellence may be
denominated <em>iron</em>; for its luxuriant growth of vice, <em>leaden</em>; and for
its dearth of writers, <em>dark</em>.” Why iron should be chosen as most
fit to typify the sterility of virtue, and lead to figure forth the luxuriance
of vice, is not perhaps at first sight obvious; but these words,
which are certainly not remarkable for the appropriateness of their
imagery, have formed the text for many commentators; from one of
whom, as being a professedly Catholic writer, I select a passage
which claims to explain at least one of the phenomena of this period&mdash;the
darkness, namely, that succeeded the establishment of the
Carlovingian schools.</p>

<p>“The want of success in the excellent establishments of Charlemagne,”
observes Mr. Berington, in his “Literary History of the
Middle Ages,” “may be traced to various causes:&mdash;to the inaptitude
of the teachers, who, though endowed with the natural powers of
intellect, knew not how to excite attention or interest curiosity; to
the subjects called sciences, or the seven liberal arts, which were so
taught as to disgust by their barbarous elements, and of which the
emaciated and haggard skeleton was alike unfit for ornament or use;
to the absence of the first rudiments of education, as of reading and
writing, in the higher orders of society, and their habitual devotion
to martial exercises; to the oblivion in which the classical productions
of former ages were held; to a want of capacity in the bishops
and clergy and monks, upon whom the weighty charge of education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
had devolved; to a selfish reflection in the same order of men
that, <em>in proportion to the decline of learning and the spread of
ignorance, their churches and monasteries had prospered</em>, whilst the
revival of letters was likely to direct the copious streams of benevolence
into a channel less favourable to the interests of the clergy
and monks; to a marked aversion in the Bishop of Rome to any
scheme by which the minds of churchmen or others might be turned
to the study of antiquity, and of those documents which would
disclose on what futile reasons and sandy foundations the exclusive
prerogatives of his see were established; and <em>to the genius of the
Christian system</em> itself, which, when it expelled the Pagan Deities
from their seats, too successfully fixed a reproach on many things
connected with them, and thus contributed to banish from the
schools, and consign to oblivion those works on the study and
prevalence of which will ever depend the progress of the arts, of the
sciences, and of literary taste.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The above passage has been somewhat of the longest, and I shall
therefore do no more than allude to the terms in which another historian
of the Middle Ages, of yet greater repute, speaks of “the inconceivable
ignorance which overspread the face of the Church, broken
only by a few glimmering lights which owe almost all their distinction
to the surrounding darkness;” to his unqualified and unsupported
declaration, that “the cathedral and monastic schools were exclusively
designed for religious purposes, and afforded no opportunities
to the laity;” that “for centuries it was rare for a layman, of whatever
rank, to know how to sign his name;” that “with the monks
a knowledge of church-music passed for literature;” and that as to
the religion which prevailed during the same period, “it is <em>an
extremely complex question whether it were not more injurious to public
morals and the welfare of society than the entire absence of all religious
notions</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>“One of the later Greek schools,” says Bacon, “is at a standstill
to think what should be in it that men should so love lies;” yet he
presently adds, “the mixture thereof doth ever give pleasure.”
Charity, then, obliges us to believe that the fictitious element which
appears in these passages has only been added to stimulate the
pleasure of the reader. In perusing them, and scores of others
which might easily be accumulated from writers both great and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
petty, we are, of course, left with the impression on our minds, that
not only was the ignorance most dense, gross, and universal, but
that it found its cause in the low cunning of the clergy, and especially
of the monks, who had just wit enough to keep the rest of the
world in darkness. And as the first writer has expressly told us that
their object in doing this was to maintain that flourishing state of
monastic prosperity which, we are assured, existed in proportion to
the spread of ignorance, we are logically bound to suppose that the
countries and the times wherein darkness thus prevailed were the
Elysium and the golden age of monkhood. No one certainly would
be led to suppose that the iron, leaden, and pitch-dark state of
society in the tenth century, could be accounted for by any particular
circumstances in the history of the times, which, far from favouring the
monastic institute, all but destroyed it, and did totally eradicate it
in the districts most subject to their influence. No,&mdash;our historians
do not so much as allude to such insignificant episodes in history
as the irruptions of three new races of barbarians, but complacently
refer us to the superstition and selfishness of the Bishop of Rome
and his clergy, which they regard, as a certain astronomer regarded
the spots in the sun, as being “large enough to account for anything.”</p>

<p>The prospect before us looks but dreary; and in candour it must be
confessed that a nearer acquaintance with this unhappy period will
not set it in a more advantageous light. It was indeed a time as
dark and terrible as the imagination can well depict, though whether
the human mind were altogether in a state of ruin, and whether
the darkness were exclusively the work of the monks, and whether
monasteries grew and prospered as ignorance increased, or whether
some other possible causes may not be assigned for the state of
things so universally deplored, are questions which cannot be resolved
without a glance at the current history of the times.</p>

<p>Enough has been said in a former chapter of the restoration of
letters which took place under Charlemagne. If any work ever had
fair promise of success, it was surely this, and yet in a certain sense
it was a failure. The century that followed his decease was precisely
the iron century which all historians have agreed to vilify, and it is
undoubtedly true that in some respects the state of Europe under
the Carlovingian monarchs was even worse than under their Merovingian
predecessors. The dream of a restoration of the Roman
Empire, which had been realised only so long as the European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
sceptre was grasped in the mighty hand of Charlemagne, fell to
pieces after his death like a child’s house of cards. The fatal step
taken by Louis the Debonnaire, of dividing his dominions among
his sons during his lifetime, plunged the whole empire into a civil
war, which resulted in his own deposition, and which did not cease
on his death. The various subdivisions into which the empire then
split were indeed reunited under Charles the Fat, but his cowardice
and incapacity having rendered him contemptible to those great
feudal vassals who were gradually assuming all the real power in the
realm, he also was deposed, and the imperial dignity ceased to find
a representative till it was revived under Otho the Great. For a
century after the death of Charles, France was nominally governed
by princes of the Carlovingian race, appointed or removed at the
will of the dukes of France. On the death of Duke Hugh the Great,
his son, Hugh Capet, contented himself for a time with the system
adopted by his predecessors, but in 987 he assumed the royal title,
the powers of which he had long exercised, and became the founder
of the Capetian dynasty. During the progress of these events, the
firmly-knit and centralised government of Charlemagne totally disappeared;
the territories of his empire were divided first into three,
then into seven kingdoms; and were finally dismembered into more
than fifty feudal sovereignties. Florus, the deacon of Lyons,
mentioned in a former chapter, in a poem entitled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Querela de divisione
Imperii</i>, describes the disorders consequent on these changes
with an eloquent pen. “A beautiful empire,” he says, “once
flourished under a glorious crown. Then there was one prince and
one people, and every town had judges and laws. The word of
salvation was preached to nobles and peasants, and youth everywhere
studied the Sacred Scriptures and the liberal arts.... Now,
instead of a king, we see everywhere a kinglet, instead of an empire,
its fragments. The bishops can no longer hold their synods, there
are no assemblies, no laws; and if an embassy arrive, there is no
court to receive it.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>By the end of the tenth century feudalism had fairly established
itself on the ruins of the empire. The new system brought in its
train many evils and some social benefits, but whilst in process of
development its immediate effect was to throw the whole governing
power into the hands of a number of petty lords, who were responsible
to no superior for their exercise of it. In spite, however, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the turbulence of the times, we shall find, on comparing them with
the Merovingian period, that there was a decided advance in point
of civilisation, which shows that the labours of Charlemagne and his
bishops had not been entirely thrown away. The century which
preceded the coronation of Hugh Capet, with all its intrigues and
bloody contests, does not present us with a single political murder;
whereas the Merovingian annals consist of little else than a catalogue
of such crimes. Nay, after the great battle of Fontenay, fought in
841, in which it is said that a hundred thousand of the noblest
warriors of France were slain, and which for ever established the
preponderance in that country of the Romanesque over the Tudesque
race and dialect,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the victorious combatants submitted to the severe
penance imposed on them by the bishops of the realm; and the
same singular spectacle was exhibited in 923, when, after the battle
of Soissons, the bishops assembled in council imposed very severe
penances on all concerned, thus protesting in the name of humanity
and religion against these miserable civil broils.</p>

<p>In the midst of such contests, however, the scholastic system
established by Charlemagne was entirely deprived of that support
which it had received from him and his immediate successors. The
monastic and cathedral schools were left to flourish or decay according
as the ruling abbot or bishop chanced to foster or neglect them.
The withdrawal of imperial patronage was not probably in every
respect a misfortune, but in cases where schools had only been kept
up by state support they would naturally not long survive the
break up of the government. This, however, though one, was not
the main cause of the decline of letters in the tenth century. Schools
disappeared for the simple reason that the churches and monasteries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
to which they were attached had disappeared also. It is inconceivable
how any author who has read the most meagre abridgments of
European history can be found to advance the monstrous assertion
that monasticism flourished after the death of Charlemagne in proportion
as ignorance increased. The tenth century, this very century
of lead and iron ignorance, witnessed the all but total extinction of
the monastic institute in France; and in Germany, where it survived
and flourished, schools and letters continued to flourish likewise.
If any spots are discoverable west of the Rhine where sparks of
learning were still kept alive, we shall find them in those remote
retreats where the monks took shelter from the storm which was
elsewhere laying waste all the fairest sanctuaries of the land. In
short, the iron age was an age of darkness because it witnessed a
return of those barbaric incursions which had already swept away
the Roman civilisation, and which were now attacking the Christian
civilisation which had sprung up in its place. The calamities that
were already hanging over Europe before the death of Charlemagne
had not been unforeseen by his eagle glance. So early as 810 the
Norman keels had appeared off the shores of Friesland, and the
powerful marine force which then guarded the coasts of the empire
proved but a vain protection. He himself beheld them in the offing
from the windows of his palace in one of the Narbonnese cities, and
sorrowfully predicted the evils they would bring on his people after
his death. And his words were only too soon fulfilled. In the
reign of Louis the Debonnaire the Normans sailed up the Loire and
laid siege to Tours, reducing the whole country as far as the Cher
to a desert. In the following reign they showed themselves yet
bolder. Entering the Seine they proceeded up that river to Paris,
which they sacked, after massacring all the inhabitants who had
not saved themselves by flight. Treves, Cologne, Rouen, Nantes,
Orleans, and Amiens, shared a similar fate. At Aix-la-Chapelle they
turned the chapel of Charlemagne into a stable: Angers was twice
given to the flames; and in 885 took place that terrible siege of
Paris, by an army of thirty thousand Normans, which has been
rendered famous by the historic poem on the subject written by
the monk Abbo, and which lasted for thirteen months. In the
course of this siege the Normans filled up the ditch which separated
them from the walls by the bodies of their slaughtered prisoners.</p>

<p>The mode of warfare adopted by the invaders was entirely novel.
Their fleets entered the estuaries of rivers and ascended them almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
to their source, predatory bands landing on either bank to ravage
the surrounding country. From the great rivers they proceeded up
the lesser streams, which led them into the heart of fertile districts.
They would seize on some island suited for their purpose, where
they fortified themselves and spent the winter. In this way whole
provinces, even those most remote from the sea-coast, were devastated,
and that so entirely that, says one writer, “not a dog was left to bark
in them.” The inhabitants deserted their villages and fields at the
first alarm, and fled to the woods; towns were sacked and given to
the flames, and the churches and monasteries which were supposed
to contain the greatest treasures were the first objects of attack.
“What else is now to be seen,” says the author of the “Romaunt of
the Rose,” “but churches burnt and people slain? The Normans
do as they please, and from Blois to Senlis there is not an acre of
wheat left standing.” Another monkish historian thus describes
what was passing under his own eyes: “Not a city, not a town, not
a village but has in its turn felt the barbarity of the heathen men.
They overrun the whole country, and their cabins form great villages
where they keep their miserable captives in chains.” The desolate
tracts of country thus laid waste became the resort of packs of wolves,
which prowled about unmolested; it seemed, says one historian, as
if France were abandoned to the wild animals.</p>

<p>The Carlovingian princes offered but a feeble resistance to these
terrible invasions. The Normans themselves were surprised at the
supineness of their victims. “The country is good,” said Ragnar
Lodbrog to the Danish monarch, after returning from the sack of
Paris, “but the people are tremblers. The dead there have more
courage than the living, for the only resistance I met with was from
an old man named Germanus, who had been dead many years, and
whose house I entered.” He spoke of the Church of St. Germain
d’Auxerre, where his sacrilegious marauders had been miraculously
put to flight. In the reign of Charles the Bald the only opposition
to the invaders was offered by Robert the Strong, who in reward of
his exertions received the dukedom of France, by which name was
then designated the country lying between the Seine and the Loire.
As to the king himself he was content to buy off the sea-king Hasting
by the payment of forty thousand livres of silver, promising
either to give up as prisoners, or to ransom at a fixed sum, every
Frenchman who had escaped from the Normans’ hands, and to pay
a composition for every Norman who should be slain; a stipulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
which probably exceeds in infamy any other ever agreed upon by
a Christian prince. A few years later the cowardice exhibited by
Charles the Fat, at the second siege of Paris, moved his indignant
subjects to deprive him of the crown; an heroic defence was indeed
offered by Eudes, son of Robert the Strong, but his chief supporters
were three priests, Gauzlin, Bishop of Paris, his nephew Ebbo, and
Anchesius, abbot of St. Germain-des-Pres. In 912, the devastations
committed by Rollo and his followers obliged Charles the Simple to
make peace with them, on terms which made over to the Norman
chieftain the feudal sovereignty of Neustria. The wild sea-king
received baptism, and became the first duke of Normandy but
though a stop was thus put to the attacks on Paris and the northern
coast, the Northmen continued their ravages in the provinces south
of the Loire.</p>

<p>Terrible as they were, however, these barbarians were only one
out of the many savage swarms let loose on Europe at this unhappy
time. In 836, the Saracens, who were the masters of the
Mediterranean, attacked the coasts of Provence. Marseilles, the
only city of Septimania where Roman letters still partially lingered,
was surprised and pillaged, and the monks and clergy carried into
slavery. The Saracens established themselves at Frassinet, a port
between Toulon and Frejus, and held possession of it for more than
a century. From these head-quarters they were able at their pleasure
to ascend the Rhone as far as Arles, and to overrun all the south
of France. About the same time they sailed up the Tiber, and
advancing as far as Rome, burnt a great part of that city. “How
many and great are the things we are suffering from the Saracens!”
wrote Pope John VIII. to Charles the Bald; “why should I attempt
to describe them with the tongue, when all the leaves of the forest,
were they turned into pens, would not suffice. Behold cities, walled
towns, and villages bereft of inhabitants! Wild beasts usurp the
sanctuaries once filled with the chair of doctrine. Instead of breaking
the bread of life to their flocks there, bishops have to buy their
own. Rome herself is left desolate. Last year we sowed, but could
not reap our harvests by reason of the Saracens; this year we can
hope for none, for in seed-time we could not till the ground.”
Every part of the Italian peninsula was wasted by these barbarians,
who established themselves at Benevento, and were not driven thence
till the end of the century. They even had the audacity to seize
and hold possession of fortified posts in Provence, Dauphiny, Savoy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
and Piedmont, which gave them the command of the Alpine passes,
so that they could stop and levy tribute on all the pilgrims travelling
from the north to Rome.</p>

<p>But this was not all. The last and worst of the plagues poured
out on Christendom yet remains to be noticed. Towards the close
of the ninth century, the Magyars or Huns, driven westward by the
advance of other Asiatic tribes, crossed the Carpathian mountains,
and descended into the plains of Dacia. Thence they spread like
a torrent over Germany, which they ravaged as far as the Black
Forest. Crossing the Alps, they laid waste the plain of Lombardy,
and thence poured into Aquitaine, which they overran as far as the
Pyrenees. Some bands proceeded as far as the southern extremity
of Italy, others found their way into Greece, and advanced to the
walls of Constantinople. In 926, they appeared on the frontiers of
Lorraine, and laid the German princes under tribute. Their wild
habits and ferocious appearance inspired such universal terror, that
it was commonly believed that the sun turned blood red at their
approach. “They live not as men, but as savage beasts,” says one
chronicler, “eating raw flesh and drinking blood. It is even
reported that they devour the hearts of their prisoners, and they are
never known to be moved to pity.” Filled with the bitterest hatred
of the Christian name, their track was marked by the smoking ruins
of churches and monasteries, and the panic which they spread has
survived even to our own time in the popular tales of the savage
Ogres, a corruption of the name <em>Ungren</em>, by which they were known
in the Tudesque dialect. The incursions of the Hungarians lasted,
at intervals, for the space of eighty years, nor did they entirely cease
until the death of their great chief Tatsong, in 972.</p>

<p>Events such as these will, probably, be thought sufficient to account
for any amount of social disorder and literary decay. As to the
supposed prosperity enjoyed by the monasteries in this darkest of all
the dark ages, it might be illustrated by a catalogue of their sacked
and smoking ruins. Fontanelles, with its noble library, St. Ouen and
Jumièges, were all burnt by the Norman sea-king Hasting in 851.
Marmoutier was pillaged two years later, one hundred and sixteen of
the monks being slain. St. Martin’s of Tours was burnt in 854, and
most of the seats of learning founded in the former century&mdash;such as
the abbeys of Corby, Liege, Stavelo, Prom, and Malmedy&mdash;were
destroyed about the same time. By the beginning of the tenth
century hardly one of the great French abbeys was left standing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and the monks being slaughtered or dispersed, their houses and
lands were in many cases seized by laymen, who lived there with
their wives, children, and hunting-dogs, a scandal complained of in
909 by the fathers of the council of Troli. Italy presented much
the same spectacle. The abbey of Nomantula was plundered no
less than seven times over&mdash;“first by Christians in the civil wars;
next by the Vandals; a third time by the Saracens in 831; a fourth
time by the Normans, which was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desolatio desolationum</i>; the sixth,
and seventh time by the Huns,” who in 899 slaughtered all the
monks, together with their abbot Gregory. A page might be filled
with the names of French bishops massacred with their clergy. It
could hardly be expected that schools and letters would greatly
flourish at a time when the whole country was lit up by the flames
which were destroying the only sanctuaries of learning; and when
the libraries which had cost years of persevering toil in their collection
were destroyed in one hour of ruthless barbarism. Mezeray, in
his history of France, particularly notices the destruction of books
among the calamities of the period. “Books,” he says, “were
becoming scarce at this time, the wars had almost destroyed them
all by burning, tearing, and other such like barbarities; and as there
were none but monks who transcribed the copies, <em>and as monasteries
were now for the most part deserted</em>, the number of learned men was
but small.” Odericus Vitalis in like manner speaks of the irreparable
loss occasioned by the destruction of those manuscripts, which
furnished the only materials for compiling the history of the times,
all of which had perished with the monastic libraries in which they
were preserved. Hallam, however, while noticing the destruction of
the monasteries and the incursions of the barbarians, sees nothing in
these facts to explain that prevailing ignorance of which he elsewhere
so loudly complains. In one passage only does he so much as
connect the two ideas together, and then it is only in order to direct
a sneer against the monks. “As the Normans were unchecked by
religious awe,” he says, “the rich monasteries were overwhelmed in
the storm. <em>Perhaps</em> they may have sustained some irrecoverable
losses of ancient learning; but their complaints are of monuments
disfigured, bones of saints and kings dispersed, and treasures carried
away.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt that the monks did attach a very great value
to the holy relics preserved in their churches, and that they rarely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
notice the destruction of any sanctuary without saying something of
their loss, or the efforts made to preserve them. But it is puzzling
to think how Mr. Hallam could have become aware of this fact
without also informing himself of their kindred lamentations over the
loss of their books. The monastic chroniclers generally couple the
two subjects so closely together, that we know not what term to
bestow on that singular organisation which enables a reader to
acquaint himself with one without knowing anything at all about the
other. A very few instances given at random may suffice to show
what we are to think of the innuendo conveyed in the sentence
above quoted. When the Normans burnt Hamburgh, they destroyed
not only the city, but the church and monastery which St. Anscharius
had built with such extreme care, together with the library containing
a collection of books presented to him by Louis the Debonnaire,
all beautifully transcribed. None were saved, excepting so many as
each monk was able to carry with him. They went out of the city,
therefore, bearing <em>their books and their relics</em>, not knowing whither to
bend their steps; but Anscharius, who saw the labours of a lifetime
destroyed in a moment, uttered no complaint, repeating only the
words of Job: “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
blessed be the name of the Lord!”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Pingonio again gives the
following narrative from the ancient chronicles of the monastery of
Novalesa. In 906 the monks of that house flying on the approach
of the Saracens, took with them <em>their treasure and their library</em>, which
last numbered upwards of 6000 volumes. They found their way
safely to Turin, where, not being able to procure a house in which
to stow away so many books, Riculf, Bishop of Turin, took 500
volumes off their hands, in part discharge of the cost of their maintenance.
Erelong, however, the Saracens entered Turin also,
plundered their treasure, and <em>burnt their library</em>; and the books
which Riculf had taken were unhappily lost after his death, so that
the poor monks were never able to recover them. Again, in 842,
when the Normans sacked the town of Nantes, and slaughtered the
bishops and clergy in the cathedral, the historian of Armorica tells
us that, having loaded their vessels with plunder and captives, the
heathen men proceeded to a certain island to divide the spoil. A
quarrel ensued over the division, and some of the captives profited
by the confusion to make their escape. One man, bolder than the
rest, thought he might as well secure some of the valuables. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
on what does the reader suppose he pitched? Neither on jewelled
reliquary, nor church-plate, but on the great Bible which had been
used in the cathedral, and which he took on his back and ran off
with to the mines, where he remained concealed with some of his
companions, until the Normans took their departure. “The fugitives
then issued from their hiding place, and returned to Nantes,”
says the chronicler, having lost much in <em>books</em>, silver and gold, and
having saved nothing but their Bible.</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, we read of the strange expedients used by the
owners of books to conceal them from plunderers. In the abbey of
Pfeffers, the books and the church-plate were always hidden together,
and on more than one occasion unexpected discoveries were made
in aftertimes, of the deposits thus contrived. In the twelfth century
one of these secret stores was accidentally brought to light, and contained,
besides church plate and vestments, a rich library. Its
catalogue included, besides missals and choral books, the works of
most of the Latin fathers, and those of Virgil, Lucan, Statius, Sallust,
Cicero, and many others. When the great abbey of St. Gall’s was
threatened by the Huns, the first thought of the abbot was to send
the books across the lake to Reichnau. In some of the Italian convents
it was always the custom to bury the books on the approach
of the Saracens; and several manuscripts may still be seen in the
Library of Florence, bearing traces on their covers of having been so
dealt with. Not unfrequently the relics are spoken of as being kept
in the library, of which an instance occurs in an anecdote preserved
by Martene, concerning the monks of St. Florent. When their
monastery was threatened by the Normans, they fled to Tournus,
taking with them the body of their patron saint. The danger being
past, they prepared to return, but their ungenerous hosts, the monks
of Tournus, refused to let them take the body with them. Very
disconsolately they bent their steps back to St. Florent without their
treasure: but one of their number, named Absalon, devised a
scheme for its recovery. “He was,” says the historian, “a very
skilful youth, very fond of law-studies, and much given to letters.”
His law-studies had possibly sharpened his wits, but the reader must
forgive his wiliness, remembering that it was put forth in a just
cause. He feigned illness, and remained behind at Tournus, where
the monks entrusted him with the offices of scholasticus, librarian,
and cantor, and one night, having the keys of the library he effected
a quiet entrance, and taking the body of St. Florent from the place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
where it was deposited, lost no time in finding his way with it back
to his own monastery.</p>

<p>One other story may suffice on this subject, which I purposely
select as having more to do with relics than books, because it shows
that even the narratives more specially devoted to chronicling the
loss of saints’ bones often indicate the loss of books also; and
because, moreover, it gives us to understand that monks could
sometimes act as village schoolmasters. It is from the pages of
Odericus Vitalis, and will assist us in forming some notion of the
sort of violence to which monasteries were exposed, not only from
Huns and Saracens, but even from their Christian neighbours.</p>

<p>For many years after the conversion of the Normans, and their
peaceable establishment in the north of France, they continued to
be objects of jealous fear to the French sovereigns, and particularly
to Louis l’Outremer, who, in 943, treacherously got possession of
the young Duke Richard, and detained him prisoner. He then
proceeded to lay plans for recovering possession of the duchy. He
offered Hugh the Great, duke of France, the grant of an enormous
territory on condition of his reducing the strong places of the
Normans, and Hugh, nothing loth, overran the duchy with a powerful
army, and sent some of his men under command of his chancellor,
Herluin, to Ouche, where they were hospitably entertained at
the monastery of St. Evroult. The simple monks, who thought they
had nothing to fear from Christians and Frenchmen, showed them
all over the house, and exhibited their oratories and the secret
recesses where the bones of the saints were deposited. For this
act of confidence they soon paid dearly.</p>

<p>Bernard the Dane, uncle to the young duke, finding himself unable
to resist the superior force of the French, had recourse to stratagem,
and persuaded the king that the Normans would at once own his
sovereignty, if the army of Duke Hugh were withdrawn. Louis
accordingly sent orders to Hugh to retire; but the fiery duke, enraged
at this breach of faith on the part of a monarch whose crown
depended on his good will, commanded his soldiers to withdraw
indeed from Normandy, but not till they had wasted the country,
burnt the towns, and driven off the cattle. The savage soldiery
executed his orders with delight, and the band that had been
quartered at St. Evroult, remembering the treasures which had been
displayed to them, hastened thither without delay, and bursting into
the church, laid hands on the body of St. Evroult, with other holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
relics, and after ransacking the house of “everything serviceable to
human existence,” together with books, vestments, and even furniture,
they took their departure, and marched back to their own country
laden with their spoils. The poor monks were left very disconsolate;
stripped of their all, they knew not what to do, but after a while they
came to the resolution of abandoning their ruined monastery, and
following the body of their holy founder into exile. They considered
themselves the guardians of this treasure, and would not desert their
trust: perhaps, too, they hoped to soften the hearts of their
enemies, and move them at least to restore the relics. All therefore
prepared to depart, with the exception of Ascelin, the prior, who
refused to quit the monastery. “Go in God’s name,” he said, “but
as for me, I will never forsake the place where I have received so
many blessings: I shall remain as the guardian of these solitudes,
till through the mercy of the King of kings, a better day shall dawn
upon us.” Finding he was not to be moved, the others took leave
of him, and set out on their melancholy journey. They reached
the duke’s camp, and told their tale, and Hugh, touched by the
recital, promised to protect them and provide for their maintenance,
if they would follow him to his own city of Orleans. There they
had the mortification, however, of seeing the chiefs dividing their
spoils. Herluin took for his share the head of St. Evroult, a portable
altar plated with silver, and one of the books. Ralph de Tracy,
who had commanded the plundering party, obtained the remainder
of the saint’s body, which he very devoutly presented to another
abbey, but the poor monks of Ouche recovered nothing. However,
they were treated with tolerable kindness by the men of Orleans,
who provided them with a habitation, and plenty of fish, bread, and
wine, and so ended their days in France in comparative prosperity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ascelin, whom we left in the deserted abbey, did not
waste his time in barren regrets. He set himself to consider what
he could do to provide for the continuance of God’s service in that
place, and at last resolved on a step which must be acknowledged
as not a little creditable in a monk of the Age of Iron: he opened
a school. He sought out and assembled together the youths of the
neighbourhood, and among them his own nephew, and taught them
to read. There is something both picturesque and touching in the
idea thus presented to us, of the old man keeping school among
his ruins, and acting as the faithful guardian of the holy spot, doing
what good he could whilst time and strength remained to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
with too much quiet confidence in God to lose heart and courage
because all else was lost. At last, however, he died, persevering to
the last in the observance of his monastic rule, and then his scholars
were scattered, the forest thickets grew up round the ruins, and
gradually the ancient solitude recovered its former wildness, and
became the resort of wild animals. In the next generation, the
names of Ouche and St. Evroult had passed utterly out of mind,
till one day a peasant in search of a strayed bullock, followed him
into the deserted valley, and making his way through bushes and
brambles, found his beast couched on a little plot of soft green grass,
before what seemed a ruined altar, surrounded by grey walls held
together by ivy roots. And then grey-headed men were found who
had heard their fathers talk of the time when St. Evroult, who
despised the world, had made himself a dwelling in these wilds, and
how his brethren had been driven away by the soldiers of Hugh the
Great. The good knight Gaston de Montfort rebuilt the church, and
the abbey was afterwards restored and colonised from Jumièges; and
at last, in 1130, two hundred years after the forcible translation of the
relics from Ouche to Orleans, they were brought back to their rightful
home, in consequence of the eloquent entreaties of St. Bernard.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>We have said enough of the disorders of the ninth and tenth
centuries to show that, whatever were the intellectual sterility of the
Iron Age, there was cause enough to account for it. Let us now
reverse the picture, and inquire whether the clergy resigned themselves
contentedly to this lamentable state of things, or what means
they took for amending it. Our wonder is, not that the age was one
of literary decay, but that learning was not wholly extinguished; and
the exertions made by a few to preserve a knowledge of letters in the
midst of such unparalleled discouragements, strike us as more justly
meriting admiration than all the magnificent institutions founded in
more prosperous times. And such efforts were certainly made. In the
ninth century the attention paid to the establishment of schools and
the cultivation of learning under Charles the Bald and his successors,
led Henry of Rheims to declare that it seemed as if the Grecian
muses had migrated to France. This is, perhaps, a rhetorical flourish;
yet most of the episcopal schools, the names of which are given by
Mabillon, were founded during forty years of incessant civil distraction.
Even when the ravages of the barbarians swept away the fruits
of so many labours, how wonderful is the patient, hopeful perseverance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
displayed by the bishops in reconstructing their shattered
work! Give them but a few years’ respite, a short interval of comparative
tranquillity in any province, and you will invariably find
the schools restored and the old discipline beginning over again.
Thus Egidius, in his “History of the Bishops of Liege,” tells us
of the extraordinary efforts made by Bishop Heraclius to re-establish
studies in his diocese. It had borne the brunt of the Norman
invasions in the ninth century; all the existing schools had been
destroyed, and the ecclesiastics had grown so indifferent to the
subject that, when Heraclius began his administration, he found
no one to support him in his attempts to organise a fresh staff of
teachers. And yet in a few years he succeeded in restoring monastic
schools throughout the whole province, and reviving a love of
learning among all classes. He accomplished this not so much
by his exhortations as his example; for, says his biographer, “he
did not think it beneath him to frequent these schools by turns,
taking on himself the office of teacher, giving lectures to the
elder students, and patiently explaining and repeating his lessons
to those who did not understand him. When he travelled to any
distance he always corresponded with his scholars, sporting with
them in pleasant verse. Even from Italy and Calabria he remembered
to send them agreeable letters to provoke them to the love of
study, and he generally took some of them with him on his journeys,
that he might beguile the tediousness of the way by conferring with
them on the Holy Scriptures.” His successor, Notger, carried on the
good work with even greater ardour. Like Heraclius, he always
taught in his own cathedral school, and a great many of his pupils
afterwards became bishops. They were so many, and so remarkable
for their good scholarship, that their names and their various
excellences were thought worthy by a certain scholasticus named
Adelman, of being made the subject of some verses, which are still
preserved.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Notger had originally been a monk of St. Gall’s, and
had been called thence to direct the school of Stavelot. He
naturally, therefore, had a taste for teaching, and, like Heraclius, he
never travelled without a troop of scholars, abundance of books, and
what his biographer calls <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arma scholaria</i>. Nor were all of his
scholars clerks, for we are expressly told that he had numerous
young laics entrusted to him that he might train them in a manner
suitable to their state of life. He did so much for his cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
city, that he has been called its second founder, and not a few of the
churches and pious institutions existing there at the present day owe
their erection to his munificent zeal.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>At Rheims, which from its geographical position enjoyed a longer
immunity from pillage than cities situated on the great rivers, schools
and teachers found a safe retreat and ample encouragement from
Archbishop Hincmar. However, the Normans at last made their
way thither; and when Fulk succeeded to the archiepiscopal dignity,
he found both the cathedral school, and that established for the
rural clergy, ruined and deserted. He restored them both, and
invited the two monks, Remigius of Auxerre and Hucbald of St.
Amand, to come and take charge of them. Their scholastic pedigree
has been given in a former chapter, and they are commonly regarded
as the chief restorers of learning in France. Fulk, who knew their
value, encouraged his clergy to profit from their instructions by
himself taking his seat as a scholar among the youngest of his clerks.
The Rheims pupils included many men of note, such as Flodoard
the historian, whom Fleury calls the ornament of his age. The old
epitaph on his tomb praises him as “a good monk, a good clerk,
and a better abbot,” and concludes with two lines somewhat hyperbolical
in their expression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Per sen histoire maintes nouvelles sauras</div>

  </div>

<p>Hucbald was famous as a poet, musician, and philosopher; but
his colleague, Remigius, was great in grammar, and wrote comments
on Priscian, Donatus, and Marcian Capella. He taught humane
letters and theology, and was extraordinarily learned in Scripture
and the Fathers. After the death of Fulk he proceeded to Paris,
and opened the first public school which we know with any certainty
to have been established in that city. This, according to the Paris
historians, was the real germ of the university; at any rate it was
the first of those celebrated schools out of which the university
subsequently developed. Nevertheless, half a century earlier, in the
midst of the great siege of Paris, there had been both schools and
scholars, for Abbo of St. Germain apologises for the incomplete
state of his poem before mentioned, “on account of the multitude
of his pupils.” Whence we gather that even famine and massacre
had never entirely extinguished the Parisian thirst for letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>Remigius continued to teach at Paris for several years, pupils
coming to him from all parts of France. Among them was one
whose story deserves to be told a little more at length, inasmuch
as it exhibits, in a striking manner, the utter ruin which had fallen
on the monastic institute in the French provinces, and at the same
time shows us that in the tenth century laymen were to be found
who were possessed of a respectable education, and were capable of
collecting libraries. There lived at that time, in the province of
Maine, a certain noble named Abbo, who had been fortunate enough
in his youth to find some school where he not only learnt how to
sign his name, but acquired a great taste for reading. His reading,
too, was of a solid kind, for his favourite studies were the histories
of the ancients, and the “Novellæ” of Justinian, the latter of which
he knew by heart, using his legal erudition when called on to dispense
justice to his feudal subjects, and to act as umpire in the
disputes which arose among his neighbours. The Gospels were
always read aloud at his table, and on the Vigils of solemn feasts
he and his family spent the night in prayer and watching. Nor are
we to draw the hasty conclusion that Abbo’s household, and his way
of life, was at all an extraordinary exception from the common rule.
He had friends as learned and as holy as himself, such as Duke
William of Aquitaine, whose religious habits earned him the surname
of “the Pious,” while his love of letters gained him that of “the
Grammarian.” This good prince had a number of books in his
castle, and during the long winter evenings he amused himself by
reading them, never leaving his studies till fairly overcome by
sleep. Abbo had one son named Odo, born in 879, and whilst
yet an infant, his father going to see him in his cradle, by a
devout impulse took him in his arms and offered him to St.
Martin. As he grew up he was given in charge to a priest to be
taught his letters, but it does not appear that there was any idea of
bringing him up to the ecclesiastical state: on the contrary, his
father placed him in the household of Duke William, that he
might acquire the martial exercises becoming a knight. Odo,
however, had no taste for these pursuits, and the chase and the
tilt-yard were insupportably wearisome to him. Praying to Our
Lady that he might be guided in the choice of a state of life, he was
for three years attacked by inveterate headaches, which obliged him
to return home, and which obstinately resisted every remedy. His
father at last became persuaded that it was not the will of God that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
his son should pursue a secular calling. Remembering his former
promise to St. Martin, and finding that Odo’s own wishes pointed in
the same direction, he took him to Tours, and placed him, in his
nineteenth year, among the canons of that city. There was a very
solemn reception of the noble postulant, and among those who
assisted at the ceremony was the brave Count Fulk of Anjou, the
same who has before been mentioned as himself holding a canon’s
stall, and scandalising king Louis by his proficiency in music.</p>

<p>No sooner did Odo find himself in quiet possession of his new
retreat than he applied himself to his books with an ardour that
quite astounded his brother canons. They perpetually asked him
what he meant by all this reading, and where could possibly be the
good of it. Odo let them talk as they would, and made no change
in his habits. He often spent the whole day in study, and the whole
night in prayer. He finished his course of grammar, and was about
to commence Virgil, when he was deterred by a vision, in which he
seemed to see a beautiful vessel filled with serpents, which he understood
to indicate the poison to be found in the charms of profane
literature. Putting it aside, therefore, he devoted himself exclusively
to the study of the Scriptures, and to obtain the more freedom from
interruption, he shut himself up in a little cell which Count Fulk had
given him, and distributing all his money to the poor, lived on the
moderate daily allowance of half a pound of bread and a handful of
beans. However, he soon became desirous of better teaching than
he had as yet been able to procure, so he set out for Paris, and
entered at the school of Remigius of Auxerre. That master made
him go through a course of the liberal arts, and gave him to study
the treatises of Marcian Capella, and the “Dialectics” of St.
Augustine.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>On his return to Tours he applied himself to the study of St.
Gregory’s “Morals,” in which he took such delight that he wrote an
abridgment of it, which is still preserved. His love of letters may
be gathered from the fact that he gradually procured himself a
library of a hundred volumes&mdash;a very large collection in those days
for any private individual. Among them were some “Lives of the
Holy Fathers,” and the “Rule” of St. Benedict, the constant study
of which filled Odo with an intense desire to embrace the monastic
state. In this he was encouraged by the intimate friendship he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
formed about this time with a knight named Adegrim, one of the
household of the good Count Fulk. At last Adegrim threw up his
military employments and came to live with the young canon at
Tours. The talk of the two friends was ever of monks and of
monasteries, and they made many journeys into different parts of
France to seek out the sites of those once famous abbeys of which
they had read, and to discover if perchance one yet survived in its
ancient state of discipline. But these expeditions invariably ended
in disappointment. For more than sixty years the monastic institute
in France had been utterly ruined. Most of the houses so renowned
in the last century were now nothing but heaps of blackened ruins.
The monks had either been slain or driven out as wanderers.
Sometimes they were to be met with in the guise of poor vagrants;
sometimes in places far from public resort you might come upon a
miserable hut, where the remnants of what had once been a flourishing
community were gathered together in the wilderness, striving to
keep their Rule as best they might. This is not a fancy picture. It
was about this very time that William Longsword, duke of Normandy,
was induced to restore the abbey of Jumièges, having when hunting
in the forest come upon two poor monks who were trying to construct
a cell for themselves out of the ruins of the abbey. All the refreshments
they could offer him were some barley bread and some water;
and the spectacle of their poverty, together with the remembrance
that the desolation he witnessed had been the work of his own
Norman forefathers, induced the duke to undertake the work of
restoration. Abbo and Adegrim, however, were not to be discouraged
in their plan. Finding no house in France where they
could embrace the life to which they longed to devote themselves,
they resolved to carry on their search in Italy, and Adegrim accordingly
set out, intending to make the pilgrimage to Rome. But as
he passed through Burgundy he accidentally found his way to La
Baume, a small monastery which had been recently founded by the
abbot Berno, and in which the Rule of St. Benedict was strictly
observed, together with the reformed Constitutions of St. Benedict
d’Anian. Adegrim at once wrote to his friend, bidding him come
without delay, and bring all his books with him; and Odo lost no
time in obeying the summons. In the year 909 he began his
noviciate, being then exactly thirty years of age. Adegrim, after
three years of penitential exercises, begged leave to retire to a little
cave about two miles distant from the monastery, where he spent the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
rest of his life as a hermit. But a very different course awaited his
friend Odo. His books pointed him out to be the right sort of man
for a schoolmaster, and he was therefore charged with the education
of the children brought up in the monastery, and the younger monks.
He had much to suffer from the jealousy of some of his brethren;
but Berno, rightly appreciating both his talents and his humility,
sent him to Turpion, Bishop of Limoges, to be ordained priest.</p>

<p>The reformed monastery of La Baume soon became the mother-house
of other foundations. Those who deplored the decay of
learning and religion were eager to provide for the restoration of
both, by erecting houses in which the Rule and spirit of St. Benedict
might be revived in their ancient vigour. Abbo’s old friend, Duke
William of Aquitaine, was of the number of those who desired to
take part in the good work, and he invited Berno to choose a site
for a new foundation in any part of his dominions. Berno selected
a beautiful solitude, about four miles from Macon, on the confines
of Burgundy, where the river Grosne, after passing the village of
Bonnay, winds down to the Seine from the mountains of Beaujolais,
through a valley girt in by high hills covered with forests. It was
exactly suited for the purposes of a religious retreat, but the duke
hesitated when Berno named it, for it was his favourite hunting
ground, and was at that time occupied by his kennel of dogs.
“Well, sir,” said Berno, when the duke had explained his difficulty,
“it is only to turn out the dogs, and to turn in the monks.” This
recommendation was accordingly followed, and in course of time
there arose among those wooded hills the stately abbey of Cluny, the
church of which was inferior in size to none save St. Peter’s of
Rome.</p>

<p>On the death of Berno in 927, the bishops of the province obliged
St. Odo to accept the government of Cluny and two of the other
five houses which had sprung under the reformed Rule. Not content
with this, they likewise forced upon him the most odious and
difficult of all imaginable enterprises; that, namely, of restoring
monastic discipline in a vast number of other houses both in France
and Italy, which had fallen into the hands of a dissolute set of men,
who sometimes opposed the entrance of the abbot, sword in hand.
Odo entered on this work in obedience, and accomplished it in the
spirit of meekness. There is no courage like that of gentle souls,
and the history of this great reformer exhibits him to us forsaken by
his terrified attendants, and riding up on his ass to the gates of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Fleury, where a band of armed men were awaiting his coming, having
sworn to kill him if he dared set foot among them. But Odo’s
meekness gained the day, and among the seventeen abbeys which
accepted the Cluniac reform, that of Fleury became one of the most
flourishing.</p>

<p>In fact, the character of St. Odo had nothing of that stern
austerity which we commonly associate with the notion of a reformer.
Its force was its amiability. He used to tell his monks that cripples
and beggars were the door-keepers of heaven, and would not endure
that they should be spoken to with harshness. If he heard the
porter giving a gruff answer to the crowds of poor who thronged his
gate, he would go out to them and say, “My friends, when that
brother comes to the gates of Paradise, answer him as he has just
answered you, and see whether he will like it.” On his journeys, if
he met any children, he always stopped, and desired them to sing or
repeat something to him, and he did this, says his biographer, that
he might have an excuse for giving them something. And if he met
an old woman or a cripple, nothing would prevent his getting off his
beast and mounting them in his place, when he would desire his
servants to hold them securely in the saddle, while he himself led
them on their way. This excess of goodness made him so dear to
his monks, that they would often steal behind him and indulge their
affection and respect by secretly pressing to their lips the hem of his
garment.</p>

<p>St. Odo died in 942, and in 965 Maieul or Majolus, a former
canon of Macon, was elected abbot. His life, like that of his predecessor,
affords an illustration of the two features in the century
which I am most solicitous to bring before the reader’s notice; the
disordered state of society, consequent on the barbaric invasions,
and the fact that in spite of such disorders, men were not wholly
indifferent to letters, though they were often sadly at a loss to find
the means of acquiring them. Maieul made his studies at Lyons,
which his biographer, Odilo, declares was then regarded as the
nurse and mother of philosophy, under a rather celebrated teacher
named Anthony de l’Isle Barbe. He learnt both kinds of literature,
says the monk Syrus, who also wrote his life, the divine and human,
and attained to whatever was most sublime in the one, and most
difficult in the other. The approach of the Saracens obliged him to
leave Avignon, his native city, and retire to Macon, where he was
chosen first canon and then archdeacon. But as he found that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
clergy and people had it in their mind to procure his further promotion
to the bishopric of Besançon, he fled to Cluny, where he was received
with great affection, and in process of time was appointed schoolmaster,
librarian, and syndic of the house. In this combination of
the intellectual and the temporal government he managed to make
himself greatly beloved, and in 948, with the consent of the whole
community, Aimard, the successor of Odo, whom Syrus styles a son
of innocence and simplicity, surrendered the government of the
abbey and all its dependencies into his hands. Both as scholasticus
and coadjutor to the abbot, Maieul superintended the studies of his
monks, and it is remarkable that he had to use the bridle rather than
the spur. He was obliged to exert his authority to discourage their
excessive study of the profane poets, especially Virgil; not that he
disapproved of a moderate use of humane literature; on the contrary,
he advocated the principle that we should get all the good out of it
that we can; but he would have preferred to see his monks learned
in the Scriptures, the reading of which formed his own delight.
Whether he walked or rode, the Sacred volume was never out of his
hands, and when he travelled into distant countries he always took
with him a portable library. These journeys were very frequent, for
Maieul extended the Cluniac reform into a great number of abbeys,
and made many pilgrimages to Rome. Returning from that city in
973, he was attacked, whilst crossing the Alps, by the Saracens of
Frassinet, and carried off, together with all his retinue. His captors
chained him hand and foot, and confined him in a cave among the
mountains, plundering him of all his baggage, and among other
things of his books. The saint recommended himself to God in the
spirit of martyrdom, and then lay down on the floor of the cavern to
take what rest he might. On awakening he was surprised to find
lying on his breast one of his lost books, which appeared to have
been overlooked by the plunderers. He opened it, and found it
was a treatise on the Assumption of Our Lady, and counting
the days, he found that there remained exactly twenty-four to the
Feast of the Assumption; so he began to pray that through the
intercession of the Queen of Heaven, he might perhaps be permitted
to keep that Feast among Christians. After a while the
Saracens began to treat him more kindly. They allowed him to
write a letter to his brethren directing them to send the money for
his ransom, and seeing that he did not eat the meat which they
set before him, one man took a shield, and baring his arms, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
proceeded to knead some meal in this strange dish, and produced
a cake which the prisoner gratefully accepted. Another time a
Saracen, wishing to clean his lance, set his foot on the great Bible
which formed part of the abbot’s library. Pained at the irreverence,
the saint gently remonstrated with him, but without effect, and a few
days afterwards the man quarrelling with his companions, they cut off
the very foot that had been set on the Sacred Volume. At last the
ransom arrived, and the prisoners were liberated, and Maieul spent
the Feast of the Assumption among Christians, as he had prayed.
Not long afterwards the Saracens were driven from Frassinet by Duke
William of Arles, and the books of St. Maieul being found among
their baggage, were sent back to him at Cluny to his very great joy.</p>

<p>The information conveyed in stories of this kind will be taken for
what it is worth. It does not certainly represent the monks of the
Iron Age as prodigies of erudition, but it shows that they did a little
more than learn their Psalter. In some cases they certainly set
themselves to overcome the difficulties which then beset the path of
learning with a perseverance and success that merit all praise; and
one example of this sort occurs among the monks of that very abbey
of Fleury, the reformation of which was effected by St. Odo in the
teeth of an armed rabble. Abbo of Fleury, as he is commonly called,
a contemporary of St. Maieul, did not enter the monastery until some
years after it had begun to flourish under the Cluniac rule, and the
good discipline of Abbot Wulfhad. He was a native of Orleans,
and a boy of such a sweet disposition and such a happy memory,
that he forgot nothing of his master’s lessons, and studied much in
private, not merely for the sake of knowledge, says his biographer,
but also because he counted application to study to be a means of
subjecting the flesh to the spirit. The Fleury teachers at this time
were not first-rate; however, far from being disgusted with “the
haggard and emaciated skeleton of barbarous elements,” the more
Abbo learnt the more he desired to learn. He was appointed in
time <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scholasticus</i> to his convent, but he felt by no means satisfied as
yet with his own attainments. He was tolerably well versed in
grammar, logic, and arithmetic, but he had found no one at Fleury
who could teach him the other liberal arts. With the permission of
his abbot, therefore, he resigned his office, and went first to Paris,
and then to Rheims. In these schools he acquired a knowledge of
philosophy and astronomy, but not so much of the last science as
he desired. So he next proceeded to Orleans, and there not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
perfected himself in other branches of learning, but, by dint of
expending a good sum of money, managed to get some excellent
lessons in music. This, however, could only be done secretly, by
reason of the opposition of envious minds. He had now studied
five out of the seven liberal arts, and he could not rest till he had
acquired the other two. But not being able to find any good master
either in rhetoric or geometry, he endeavoured to supply the first by
a careful study of Victorinus, the master of St. Jerome, and also by
his own exertions gained some knowledge of mathematics. We have
seen in the last chapter how he was summoned to England by St.
Oswald of York, and established sacred and scientific studies in the
monastery of Ramsay. So greatly was he esteemed by both St.
Oswald and St. Dunstan, that an amicable quarrel arose between
the two prelates as to which should keep possession of so great a
treasure. The question was settled by the abbot of Fleury recalling
Abbo to his own convent after a two years’ absence.</p>

<p>His English friends took leave of him with no small regret, and
loaded him with parting presents. St. Dunstan gave him a number
of exquisitely-wrought silver ornaments of his own workmanship,
which he requested him to present as his offerings to St. Benedict, a
portion of whose body was preserved at Fleury. St. Oswald ordained
him priest, and gave him a chalice, some vestments, and everything else
requisite for saying mass. In 988 he became abbot, in which office
he continually recommended his monks to cultivate study as the most
useful exercise next to fasting and prayer. For himself he ceased
not all his life to read, write, or dictate. His favourite studies, next
to the Holy Scriptures, were dialectics and astronomy, and among his
works were some treatises on both those subjects. Renowned for
his learning throughout Europe, he was killed at last in 1004 in an
affray between his servants and some Gascon monks of the monastery
of Reole, whither he had been sent to effect a reform.</p>

<p>In fact, if the age exhibited much decay and many scandals, it
found men ready to spend their lives in the weary work of restoration
and reformation. And it is remarkable that the greatest prelates of
the time invariably regarded the revival of monachism as the only
means of restoring good discipline and learning. Such were the
views of St. Dunstan and his fellow-labourers, and such was also the
conviction of the excellent Adalberon, who in 933 became Bishop
of Metz. He was brother to the reigning duke of Lorraine, and his
talents and zeal equalled the nobility of his birth. In order to provide
his diocese with a seminary of devoted and learned men, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
resolved on restoring the great monastery of Gorze, which had been
founded by St. Chrodegang of Metz, but which had been ruined
under the combined attacks of the Normans and the Hungarians.
He completed the rebuilding of the abbey, but was still uncertain
whence he should procure his colony of monks, when he was
informed that a little society of ecclesiastics, which had been formed
in the neighbouring diocese of Toul, was about to pass into Italy,
seeking some spot where they might unmolested lead a more perfect
life. The way in which this society had been organised was
altogether remarkable. At their head was John of Vandières, the
native of a village in the diocese of Nancy, who, having been born
when his father was advanced in years, had suffered from some of
the disadvantages of being a spoiled child. The fond parent, however,
was at last persuaded to send the boy to school, first at Metz,
and then at the monastery of St. Michael’s, where Master Hildebold,
a pupil of Remigius, gave lessons in grammar. John, however,
profited very little by his teaching, and on his father’s death, his
mother, marrying a second time, recalled him home, and gave him
the charge of all the temporal affairs of the house. John showed
considerable ability in the management of lands and revenues, and
absorbed in these cares, soon forgot the little he had learnt at school.
However, as time went on, he became disgusted with his secular way
of life, and embracing the ecclesiastical state, received two benefices
in the diocese of Toul. There he became acquainted with the
learned deacon Berners, who, by no means approving of illiterate
clerks, persuaded John to begin his studies over again. Divine
grace quickening his powers, he did his best to make up for lost
time. But he was never much of a grammarian. He contented
himself with what his biographer calls a <em>sprinkling</em> of Donatus, just
so much as enabled him to read and understand the Scriptures, to
the study of which he then exclusively devoted himself, and in which
he obtained very extraordinary light. The church which he served
was dependent on a convent of nuns at Metz, where his duties called
him from time to time to say mass. He became acquainted with
the community, and the example of their holy and mortified life
inspired him with new ardour. He began a course of reading with
these good religious, which speaks in favour of his diligence and
their patience, and in which, says his biographer, he persevered
“with all his might.”</p>

<p>First, then, having read through with them the whole of the Old
and New Testaments, he committed both to memory, “and that so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
accurately that no man could do it better,” also “all the lessons
appointed to be read in church,” which are contained in the book
called <cite>Comes</cite>; then the rules for the computing of Easter and the
canonical laws, that is, the decrees of councils, the judgments of
penitents, the mode of ecclesiastical proceedings, and the secular
laws, all of which he treasured up word for word. Of homilies,
sermons, and treatises on the Epistles and Gospels, I will only say
that he was able to repeat an alarming catalogue of them in the vernacular,
“straightforward from beginning to end, as if he were reading
from the book.” At the same time he laboured hard to acquire
a knowledge of church music, not caring for the derision of some
who considered it an unsuitable enterprise for one of his age to
engage in. However, his perseverance was rewarded with very fair
success, and it was thus that he employed his intervals of leisure
time, together with the handmaids of God.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that John’s choice of reading, considering
the gentler sex of his fellow-students, was somewhat of the driest.
Nor do I at all cite him as a model of erudition, though, considering
the deficiencies of his early education, his achievements in that line
might have saved him from the contempt of Brucker, who notices
him only to string him up among other barbarous dunces. His
studies probably took their direction from the very few books which
he had at his command, and it is at least clear that he made a tolerable
use of those he possessed.</p>

<p>His intercourse with the nuns inspired him with a great desire to
embrace a religious life, but, like St. Odo, he sought in vain for any
religious house in his own part of the country where religious discipline
still flourished. So first he joined the company of a recluse
of Verdun, named Humbert, and then he passed some time with a
hermit in the forest of Argonne, and at last, in company with Bernacer
of Metz, who was a tolerable scholar, he set out on pilgrimage
to Rome. However, even in Italy he found nothing that exactly
suited him, and returning to Verdun, resumed his former exercises
of prayer and study, under the direction of Humbert.</p>

<p>About the same time Einold, Archdeacon of Toul, had been
touched with similar desires after a perfect life; and distributing all
his goods to the poor, he shut himself up in a little cell adjoining the
cloisters of his cathedral, together with his books and his priestly
vestments, living only on what the Bishop Gauzelin sent him as an
alms. The times were, indeed, dreary enough, when, one after
another, these good men were to be found seeking, and seeking in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
vain, for some spot untouched by the spoiler’s hand. As Einold
prayed for guidance, what seemed a little schoolboy’s voice in the
street outside chanted the words, “I will give you the heritage of
your father Jacob;” and half disposed to take the words as a sign
of divine encouragement, he was still pondering over their meaning,
when Humbert of Verdun came to ask his counsel. To be brief,
the four friends, Einold, Humbert, John, and Bernacer, determined
on migrating to Italy, and establishing themselves either among the
solitaries of Mount Vesuvius, or in the neighbourhood of Monte
Cassino. And it was this little knot of holy men, who had been
drawn together by the ties of Christian sympathy, whom Adalberon
proposed to detain in France for the purpose of entrusting them
with the restoration of monastic life in the abbey of Gorze. They
accepted his offer; a very few of the old monks who yet survived
were brought back, and willingly accepted the strict reform which
Adalberon desired to establish; Einold was chosen abbot, and the
house soon became a model of good discipline. Sacred studies
were at once instituted in the school, and after his religious profession,
John of Gorze, as he was henceforth called, entered on rather
a wider range of reading than he had hitherto been able to follow.
We find him applying himself to St. Augustine, and working with
characteristic energy at certain logical studies, which were, however,
cut short by the prohibition of Einold, who desired him to leave logic
for secular students, and to confine himself to more spiritual subjects,
an injunction which he humbly and promptly obeyed. He became
abbot of Gorze about the year 960.</p>

<p>Adalberon’s zeal was not satisfied with the restoration of Gorze;
he invited a learned body of monks over from Ireland, under a
superior named Cradoc, and established them in another deserted
monastery, that of St. Clement’s at Metz. When Gerard, Bishop of
Toul, the successor of Gauzelin, heard of the arrival of the Irishmen,
he never rested till he had procured some of them for his own diocese.
He had already procured a community of exiled Greek monks,
among whom, in the following century, Cardinal Humbert acquired
his Greek learning. A sort of holy emulation sprang up between the
two prelates, which should outstrip the other in their labours at
reform and revival; and Gerard was not content with setting others
to work; he worked himself as hard as the humblest scholasticus.
He took into his own hands the instruction of his clergy in all that
appertained to ecclesiastical discipline and the ministry of preaching;
and acting on the principle that he who instructs others should never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
cease to be a learner, he never considered that his time of study
was ended; and his historian declares that even when he was in bed
he appointed some of his clerks to read to him until he fell asleep.</p>

<p>From all that has been said, it may be seen that there was no want
of solicitude on the part of the pastors of the Church to amend the
disorders of the time. In fact, we might appeal to the acts of those
very councils which show what the abuses of the times were, as
affording proof of the strenuous exertions made to correct them.</p>

<p>In Spain we are told the incursions of the Saracens had left everything
in ruins. The school of Palencia, established in the sixth
century for the education of the clergy, had fallen into decay; the
monastic institute had all but disappeared; and the sites of many
monasteries, like the famous one founded near Vierzo by St. Fructuosus,
had become wildernesses, overgrown with thorns and brushwood.
But here, as in France and Germany, bishops were to be
found stemming the strong tide of barbarism. Gennadius of Astorga
restored a great number of abbeys destroyed by the Saracens, and
placed them under the Benedictine Rule. And as the libraries that
formerly enriched them could not be at once replaced, he introduced
a custom by which the books belonging to one house were lent to a
number of others in regular succession, always returning to their
original owners. Among the books so lent appear the works of St.
Gregory, St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, and St. Augustine.</p>

<p>Even the education of the poor was not wholly uncared for in the
Iron Age. Witness the constitutions of Ado of Vercelli, Dado of
Verden, and Heraclius of Liege, in which the establishment of “little,”
or parochial, schools, is ordained, wherein poor children of both
sexes, about the age of seven, are to be received and taught gratis,
the girls and boys being always separated from one another. The
regulations, simple as they are, have a very modern sound; and so
also have those other constitutions of Riculf of Soissons, who, for
the improvement of his parish priests, hit on a scheme of <em>clerical
conferences</em>, in order to afford them means of mutual edification, on
a plan precisely similar to that adopted in later times.</p>

<p>But we have dwelt long enough on the aspect which the tenth
century presented in France. Something remains to be said of the
state of schools and monasteries during the same period on the other
side of the Rhine, where the achievements of the German prelates
were crowned with a much larger share of success, and well deserve
a chapter to themselves.</p>

<p class="pfs90">THE AGE OF THE OTHOS.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 911 TO 1024.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Louis the Fourth</span>, surnamed the Child, the last of the race of
Charlemagne who bore rule in Germany, died in 911, leaving the
empire torn to pieces with feudal wars and the devastations of
Hungarians, Sclaves and Normans. As the right of choosing his
successor belonged to the nobles, they offered the crown to Otho,
duke of Saxony, who with singular disinterestedness refused it, and
recommended as most worthy of the royal dignity, his own feudal
rival, Conrad of Franconia, who accordingly received the crown.
Not to be outdone in generosity, Conrad, at his death, named the
son of Otho as his successor, and thus Henry the Fowler became
the first German sovereign of the house of Saxony. His victory
over the Hungarians at Marsberg, in 933, gave them their first
decisive check, and in 936, his son Otho the Great completed the
discomfiture of the barbarians at the great battle of Leck, after which
they never again showed their face in Germany. In 952, Otho was
crowned king of Italy, having been called into that country to oppose
the usurper Beranger. Eight years later he was invited to Rome by
Pope John XII. and crowned emperor, no prince having borne that
title in the West for the space of forty years. Though on some
occasions he failed not to evince that tendency to despotism in
Church matters which was the hereditary vice of the German
emperors, yet his reign was truly glorious, and is spoken of by
ancient writers as a kind of golden age. His mother Matilda, and
his two wives, Editha and Adelaide, the first of whom was an
English princess, together with his brother Bruno, Archbishop of
Cologne, were all canonised saints. He showed himself the friend
of religion and learning, and caused his son, Otho II., to receive a
learned education. His grandson, Otho III., who succeeded to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
crown in 983, was also a scholar, and a pupil of Gerbert’s, and
surnamed the Wonder of the World. At his death the crown passed
to his cousin, St. Henry of Bavaria, whose brother-in-law, St. Stephen
of Hungary, converted his people to Christianity, and changed those
wild barbarians, so long the scourge of Europe, into a civilised and
Christian nation.</p>

<p>Thus, for the space of a century, Germany was blessed with a
succession of great Christian rulers, who, if they had some defects,
were yet on the whole protectors of religion, and encouragers of
learned men. Italy, indeed, is represented by most historians as
presenting during the same period a scene of lamentable decay; and
Tiraboschi gives the names of only two bishops as possessing any
pretensions to learning, namely, Atto of Vercelli, and Ratherius of
Verona. But allowance must be made for the exaggerations of party-writers,
and there are facts which cannot be altogether reconciled
with their sweeping statements. Studies were certainly carried on
in the monasteries that escaped the rage of the Saracens, and
Muratori cites a long catalogue of books, all either copied or
collected at Bobbio during the tenth century. Baronius, whose
strictures on the state of Italy are exceedingly severe, quotes the
acts of a council held at Rheims in 992, wherein it is declared that
there was scarcely one person to be found at that time in Rome who
knew the first elements of learning. Considering the unhappy and
scandalous factions which then held sway in the Roman capital, no
picture of social disorder would seem too black for us to credit; yet
bad as things were, one is staggered at the notion that no one in
the city of the Popes and the Cæsars should know even how to read.
A few years previously to the date assigned, Rome, as we shall see,
not only possessed good masters herself, but supplied them to the
German seminaries; nor is there any reason for supposing that her
political disasters necessarily closed her schools. If, from the acts
of a remote council, we turn to the writings of one thoroughly conversant
with the state of Italy, the man of his age best qualified to
judge of any matter connected with learning&mdash;I mean the famous
Ratherius of Verona&mdash;we shall find a very different description of
the state of things which he had witnessed with his own eyes. His
testimony is the more remarkable from the fact that he was the great
censor of his age, sparing neither clergy nor bishops in his caustic
attacks. Yet he assures us that in his time, and he died in 974,
there was no place where a man could get better instructed in sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
letters than in Rome. “What is taught elsewhere on ecclesiastical
dogma,” he says, “that is unknown there? It is there that we find
the sovereign doctors of the whole world; it is there that the most
illustrious princes of the Church have flourished. There the decrees
of the pontiffs are to be found; there the canons are examined;
there some are approved and others rejected; what is condemned
there is nowhere else approved, nor do men elsewhere approve of
what is there condemned. Where, then, could I be more sure to
find wisdom than at Rome, which is its fountain-head?”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> About
the same time Gerbert, the literary wonder of his age, arrived in
Rome, where his scientific acquirements were so thoroughly appreciated
by Pope John XIII. as to induce that pontiff to prevent his
return into Spain; and he accordingly wrote to the emperor, advising
him to secure the services of a man who was thoroughly well-versed
in mathematics, and able to teach them to others. But how
preposterous it seems to suppose that the mathematics of Gerbert
should be thus highly valued in a city where hardly a man was to be
found acquainted with the first elements of letters! Again, we find
from Gerbert’s own correspondence that it was from Italy that he
chiefly obtained his books. There is no city in that country, he
says, where good writers and copyists are not to be found; a fact
which conclusively proves that somebody was also to be found to
buy what was written, for the book trade could not have been kept
up without a fair supply of readers. And in the year 1000 only
eight years after the above-named council had furnished Baronius
with its dismal authority for proving Italy to be sunk in the grossest
ignorance, we find a German noble named Wippo exhorting the
emperor Henry II. to send the sons of the German nobles to be
educated “after the manner of the Italians.” Not that it at all
concerns us to whitewash the history of Italy in the tenth century,
confessedly the very <i>nadir</i> of her ecclesiastical annals; but there is
no reason for unfairly blackening even a damaged reputation, and
the united testimonies given above may at least be taken as evidence
that the words of the council must not be too literally understood.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, however, I propose to speak only of the
state of letters in Germany, where the tenth century was certainly
very far from deserving to be stigmatised as an age of iron or lead.
All the monastic chroniclers bear witness to the rapid extension of
letters, which was encouraged by the Saxon emperors, to the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
multiplication of schools, and the harvest of great men
whom they produced, so that even Meiners is forced to acknowledge
that at no period did Germany possess so many virtuous and learned
ecclesiastics. Much of this happy state of things is to be attributed
to the labours and example of St. Bruno, the younger brother of
Otho the Great, and, like him, a pupil of Heraclius of Liege. His
education began at Utrecht, where he was sent at the mature age
of four, to commence his studies under the good abbot Baldric.
Utrecht had never entirely lost its scholastic reputation since the
days of St. Gregory. Only a few years before the birth of Bruno
the see had been filled by St. Radbod, a great-grandson of that other
Radbod, duke of Friesland, who had so fiercely opposed the preaching
of St. Boniface. Radbod the bishop, however, was a very
different man from his savage ancestor; he was not only a pious
ecclesiastic, but an elegant scholar, for he had been educated in the
Palatine school of Charles the Bald, under the learned Mannon,
whose heart he won by his facility in writing verses; and the cares of
the episcopate never induced him altogether to neglect the Muses.
Besides a great number of poems which he wrote during his
residence at Utrecht, we have a Latin epigram, which he improvised
at the moment of receiving the Holy Viaticum, and which is perhaps
as worthy of being preserved as the dying epigram of the Emperor
Hadrian.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the encouragement given to learning by so
many of its bishops, Utrecht became the fashionable place of education,
and it had grown a sort of custom with the German sovereigns
to send their sons thither at an early age. Little Bruno made rapid
progress both in Greek and Latin literature; he particularly relished
the works of Prudentius, which he learnt by heart; never let himself
be disturbed by his noisy companions, and took great care of his
books. Indeed, the only thing that ever moved him to anger was
the sight of any one negligently handling a book. His reading
included something of all sorts; historians, orators, poets and philosophers&mdash;nothing
came amiss. He had native Greeks to instruct
him in their language, and became so proficient in it as afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
to act as interpreter for his brother to the Greek ambassadors who
frequented the German court. With all this he did not neglect the
sacred sciences, and a certain Isaac, a Scotch, or rather Irish professor,
who taught at Utrecht, spoke of him as not merely a scholar,
but a saint. The monk Ditmar, one of his schoolfellows, himself
afterwards celebrated in the literary world by his chronicle of the
royal house of Saxony, bears witness to the habits of piety which
adorned the very childhood of the young prince. “Every morning,”
he says, “before he left his room to go to the school, he would be
at his prayers, while the rest of us were at play.” A certain tone of
exaggeration is not unfrequently indulged in by early writers when
extolling the subjects of their biographies as prodigies of every
literary excellence, but the descriptions left us of Bruno’s intellectual
achievements do not admit of being understood as mere figures of
speech. His love of reading was almost a passion. He read everything,
“even comedies,” says his biographer, who seems a little
scandalised at the fact, but explains that he attended only to
the style, and neglected the matter. To complete the picture of
Bruno’s school-days, it must be added that he was an excellent
manager of his time, and always made the most of his morning hours,
a good habit he retained through life. I will say nothing of his
early career as the reformer of Lauresheim Abbey; he was still
young when his brother Otho succeeded to the throne, and at once
summoned Bruno to court, charging him with the task of erecting
there a Palatine academy, after the model of that of Charlemagne.
Nothing was better suited to Bruno’s wishes and capacity, and he began
at once to teach the entire curriculum of the liberal arts to a crowd
of noble pupils. Whatever was most beautiful in the historians and
poets of Greece or Rome, he made known to his disciples, and not
content with the labour entailed on him by his own lectures, he did
not allow the professors whom he chose to assist him to commence
theirs till he had previously conferred with them on the subjects
they were about to explain.</p>

<p>One of Bruno’s chief assistants was that same Ratherius who has
been already named. Originally a monk of Lobes, he had accompanied
his patron Hilduin of Liege into Italy, and there became
bishop of Verona. He was a man of great learning, and zeal too
little tempered with discretion, and his life was a series of episcopal
ejectments. Thrice was he turned out of the see of Verona, and
once out of that of Liege, to which Bruno had procured his nomination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
after the death of Hilduin. His writings are of considerable
value as monuments of the doctrine and discipline of the times, but
I mention him here rather in the character of a benefactor to youth.
For after being the second time obliged to fly from Verona, he retired,
says Folcuin, in his history of the abbots of Lobes, “to that part of
Burgundy which is called Provençe, where he taught the son of a
certain rich man named Rostang; and for his benefit composed a
little book on the grammatical art, which he called by the pleasant
name of <cite>Spara-dorsum</cite>, or <cite>Spare-the-back</cite>, to the end that young
children making use of the same in schools might be preserved from
scourges.”</p>

<p>In 953, Bruno, in spite of his youth, was demanded by the clergy
and people of Cologne for their archbishop, and being consecrated,
he at once entered on a career of gigantic labours, everywhere
re-establishing ecclesiastical discipline and social order throughout a
province long wasted by war and barbaric invasions. His political
position, moreover, imposed on him yet more extensive cares; for
Otho, who called him his second soul, when summoned into Italy,
created his brother duke of Lorraine and imperial lieutenant in
Germany. The dukedom of Lorraine at that time included all the
country from the Alps to the Moselle, which now, therefore, acknowledged
Bruno as its actual sovereign. But these multiplied dignities,
and the accumulation of business which they entailed, did not
quench Bruno’s love of study. Whenever he travelled, whether in
the visitation of his diocese, or when accompanying his brother’s
court, he always carried his library with him, “as if it had been the
ark of the Lord,” says the monk Rotger, who, moreover, remarks
that this library was stored both with sacred and profane authors,
for, like a good householder, he knew how to bring out of his
treasury things new and old. Nothing ever prevented his finding
time for reading, and he excited every one about him to cultivate
similar tastes, specially his nephew Otho, who was for some time his
pupil. Indeed, Rotger goes so far as to say that the archbishop felt
a certain want of confidence in those who had no attraction to
study; meaning probably to those unlettered clerks who cared not
to acquire the learning proper to their sacred calling. Of these
there was no lack in Lorraine; but Bruno effected a great change in
the condition of that afflicted province, by appointing good bishops,
healing feuds, reforming monasteries, and making men love one
another in spite of themselves. In all these good works he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
assisted by the learning and martial valour of Ansfrid, count of
Lorraine, who was well read both in law and Scripture, and who
used his sword exclusively to repress pillage and defend the helpless.
This feudal noble of the Iron Age spent all his leisure hours in
study, and when at last he embraced the ecclesiastical state, and at
the entreaties of the emperor accepted a bishopric, he was able to
lay his sword on the altar and render witness that it had never been
drawn in an unjust cause.</p>

<p>Bruno’s example made a great stir in Germany, and moved many
bishops to exert themselves in the work of reform. Poppo, Bishop
of Wurtzburg, sent to Rome for a celebrated master named Stephen,
and with his help the episcopal seminary was restored, and soon
boasted of a “crowd of students, and a great store of books.”
Among other pupils educated under Master Stephen were two
friends, named Wolfgang and Henry. Wolfgang was a student of
Bruno’s type, possessing an avidity for all sorts of learning; and
though he began his school-life at seven, he is said in a few years
not only to have acquired an extensive acquaintance with the letter
of the Scriptures, but to have penetrated into the pith and marrow
of their mystical sense. His father had thought it sufficient to place
him under a certain priest, to receive a very scanty elementary
education, but Wolfgang entreated that he might be sent to
Reichnau, which then enjoyed a high reputation; and here he first
met with his friend Henry. Henry was the younger brother of
Bishop Poppo, and easily persuaded Wolfgang to migrate with him
to Wurtzburg, for the sake of studying under the famous Master
Stephen. It soon appeared, however, that the disciple was more
learned than the master, and when the Wurtzburg students found
Master Stephen’s lectures very dull, or very obscure, they were in
the habit of applying to Wolfgang, who possessed that peculiar gift
of perspicacity which marked him from his boyhood as called to the
functions of teaching. Moreover, he was so kind and so willing to
impart his knowledge, that his companions declared he made daylight
out of the darkest matters; when Stephen’s prosy abstruseness
had fairly mystified them, five words from Wolfgang seemed like the
“Fiat lux,” and these observations reaching the ears of Stephen, had
the proverbial fate of all comparisons. At last, one day when
Wolfgang was surrounded by a knot of his schoolfellows, who
entreated him to expound a passage in Marcian Capella, Master
Stephen, moved to jealous anger, forbade Wolfgang any longer to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
attend the lectures. This ungenerous command obliged him to
continue his studies alone, but he seems to have lost little by being
deprived of the benefit of an instructor whom he had already far
outstripped in learning.</p>

<p>Henry and Poppo were both of them relatives of Otho, who in
956 caused the former to be raised to the archbishopric of Treves.
Henry insisted on carrying his friend with him into his new diocese,
and wished to load him with benefices and honours, all of which,
however, Wolfgang refused. He would accept of no other employment
than that of teaching youth, for which he knew his aptitude,
and which he heartily loved; and, in the true spirit of a Christian
teacher, he chose to discharge this office gratuitously, not as a means
of private gain, but as a work for souls, even supporting many of his
scholars out of his own purse. He cared as much for their spiritual
as their intellectual progress, and set them the example of a holy and
mortified life. The archbishop, in despair at not being able to promote
him as he desired, at last got him to accept the office of dean
to a certain college of canons. Wolfgang did not allow the dignity
to be a nominal one, but obliged his canons to embrace community
life, and to commence a course of sacred studies, assuring them that
the sustenance of the inner man is as necessary as that of the body.
Archbishop Henry dying in 964, Wolfgang, who had only remained
at Treves out of affection to him, prepared to return into Swabia,
which was his native country. But Bruno had his eye on him, and
inviting him to Cologne, offered him every dignity, even the episcopate
itself, if he would only remain in his duchy. Wolfgang, though
he persisted in refusing to accept any promotion, felt himself obliged
to pass some time at the prince-bishop’s court, and testified afterwards
to the fact of his great sanctity. Finding that he could not
move the resolution of his friend, Bruno at last reluctantly allowed
him to return to Swabia, where he remained only just long enough
formally to renounce his hereditary possessions, after which he withdrew
to Einsidlen, and took the monastic habit under the English
abbot Gregory.</p>

<p>At Einsidlen, as at Treves, he devoted himself to the office of
teaching, and with the same success. It was as hopeless for him to
attempt to conceal his talent, as to hide a light under a bushel. The
world soon resounded with the fame of his school, and bishops
travelled to Einsidlen to bargain for his possession. This time the
friendly persecution was revived by St. Udalric of Augsburgh, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
was himself sufficiently learned to understand the merits of the poor
monk, who asked nothing of the world but a quiet hiding-place, and
was never suffered to enjoy it for any length of time. Udalric was
a scholar of St. Gall’s, and had given marks of sanctity even during
his school days. A minute account of his manner of life when archbishop
is given in the beautiful life written by his friend Gerard.
Let it suffice to say, that besides singing the Divine Office in the
cathedral with his canons, and daily celebrating two or three masses
(a privilege then permitted to priests, as we learn from Walafrid
Strabo), he every day recited the entire Psalter, the Office of Our
Lady, together with that of the Holy Cross, and of All Saints; that
he entertained a number of poor persons at his table, exercised
hospitality on a right royal scale, administered strict justice to his
people, and courageously defended them against the oppression of
their feudal lords; finally, that he took particular care of the education
of his clergy, and directed the studies of his cathedral school in
person, none being better fitted to do so than himself. When he
made the visitation of his diocese, he travelled in a wagon drawn by
oxen, which he preferred to riding on horseback as it enabled him
to recite the Psalms with his chaplains with less interruption. In
this arrangement he certainly displayed a sound discretion, for in the
ancient chronicles of these times, more than one story is preserved
of the disasters which befell travelling monks and bishops, owing to
their habit of reading on horseback.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> His cathedral city of Augsburgh
was repeatedly attacked by the Huns; and during one of
their sieges, the holy bishop, sending the able-bodied men to the
walls collected a number of infants in arms, and laying them on
the floor of the cathedral, before the altar, prostrated himself in
prayer, hoping that their tender cries might ascend as prayer
before the Throne of God. His prayers were heard, and Augsburgh
was delivered. Such was the prelate who at last succeeded
in drawing Wolfgang out of his retirement, and compelling him
to receive priestly ordination. And in 972 the emperor Otho II.,
at the united entreaties of his bishops, appointed him Bishop of
Ratisbon, which see he governed for twenty-two years, never, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
laying aside his monastic habit. Henry, duke of Bavaria,
thoroughly understood his merits, and knowing his love of the office
of teaching, entreated him to take charge of his four children, St.
Henry, afterwards emperor of Germany, St. Bruno, who succeeded
Udalric in the diocese of Augsburgh, and the two princesses, Gisela
and Brigit, who both died in the odour of sanctity. The singular
blessing which attended his labours with these and other noble
children committed to his care, gave rise to a proverb which deserves
remembrance: “Find saints for masters, and we shall have saints for
emperors.”</p>

<p>The emperors of the tenth century were certainly fortunate in this
respect, and as I have just named Otho II., it will not be amiss to
say a few words about him, and about the tutor to whom was committed
the education of his son and successor. Otho II. had been
brought up among the canons of Hildesheim, and had acquired from
them a taste for letters, which was still further increased by his
marriage with the Greek princess Theophania. At this time the
court of Constantinople was the centre of all that survived of the old
imperial civilisation and literature. Theophania was a woman of
beauty and talent, and remarkable for her wit and eloquence, she
soon infused into the Germans a rage for Greek literature, and gave
such a brilliant character to the literary coteries of the imperial
court, that Gerbert, who was then residing there, speaks in one of his
letters of the “Socratic conversation” which he found among the
learned men who thronged the company of the empress, which, he
says, sufficed to console him amid all his troubles. In more peaceful
times it is probable that a sovereign of Otho’s character would
have effected a great restoration of letters, but the ten years of his
reign were occupied with continual wars, which affixed to his name
the appellation of “the Sanguinary,” and gave no scope for the
exercise of his really great abilities. Before his death, which took
place in 983, he obtained the election of his infant son, Otho III. as
emperor, and left him to the guardianship of Theophania, who,
during the minority of her son, governed the empire as regent.</p>

<p>The empress showed herself fully qualified for both offices. She
had it greatly at heart to provide the young emperor with a learned
education, and not unmindful of the proverb we have quoted above,
was equally solicitous to secure for his tutor one who should merit
the title of a saint. The priest whom she chose was a noble Saxon
named Bernward; he was nephew to Folcmar, Bishop of Utrecht,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
who sent him when a child of seven years old to be educated in the
episcopal school of Hildesheim, by the grave and holy master
Tangmar. This good old man, who afterwards wrote his life,
received him kindly, and to test his capacities, set him to learn by
heart some of the select passages from Holy Scripture which were
usually given to beginners. Little Bernward set himself to learn and
meditate on them with wonderful ardour, and associating himself to
the most studious of his companions, tried with their help thoroughly
to master, not only the words, but the hidden sense of his lessons.
As he was not yet judged old enough to join any of the classes, he
sat apart by himself, but listened attentively to the lectures of the
master, and the explanations which he gave, and was afterwards
found reproducing the same in a grave and sententious manner for
the edification of his younger schoolfellows. Surprised and delighted
at these marks of precocious genius, Tangmar spared no pains in
the cultivation of so promising a scholar, and had him constantly by
his side. “Whenever I went abroad on the business of the monastery,”
he says, “I used to take him with me, and I was always more
and more struck by his excellent qualities. We often studied the
whole day as we rode along on horseback, only more briefly than we
were used to do in school; at one time exercising ourselves in
poetry, and amusing ourselves by making verses, at another, arguing
on philosophic questions. He excelled no less in the mechanical
than in the liberal arts. He wrote a beautiful hand, was a good
painter, and an equally good sculptor and worker in metals, and had
a peculiar aptitude for all things appertaining to household and
domestic affairs.” Under the care of so devoted a master, the boy
Bernward, as the old man always called him, grew up to be a wise
and learned man. He had that singular ardour for acquiring
knowledge which seems one of the gifts poured out over ages in
which its pursuit is hedged about with difficulties that must necessarily
discourage a more ordinary amount of zeal. Bernward always
read during meal times, and when unable to read himself, he got
some one to read to him. His reputation determined Theophania
to choose him as tutor to her son, who made great progress under
his care, and was then sent to finish his education in the school of
the famous Gerbert. Bernward meanwhile was appointed Bishop of
Hildesheim, and in the midst of his episcopal functions, continued
to cultivate literature and the fine arts. He made time by employing
the day in business and the night in prayer. He founded <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptoria</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
in many monasteries, and collected a valuable library of sacred and
profane authors. He tried to bring to greater perfection the arts of
painting, mosaic work, and metal work, and made a valuable collection
of all those curiosities of fine art which were brought to Otho’s
court as presents from foreign princes. This collection Bernward
used as a studio, for the benefit of a number of youths whom he
brought up and instructed in these pursuits. It is not to be said
what he did for his own cathedral, supplying it with jewelled missals,
thuribles, and chalices, a huge golden corona which hung from the
centre of the roof, and other like ornaments. The walls he painted
with his own hands. The visitor to Hildesheim may still admire
the rich bronze gates, sixteen feet in height, placed in the cathedral
by its artist-bishop, the crucifix adorned with filagree-work and
jewels, made by his own hands, and the old rose-tree growing on the
cloister, which tradition affirms him to have planted.</p>

<p>His manner of life is minutely described by his old tutor Tangmar.
After high mass every morning he gave audience to any who desired
to speak to him, heard causes, and administered justice with great
readiness and promptitude. Then his almoner waited on him, and
accompanied him to the distribution of his daily alms, for every day
a hundred poor persons were fed and relieved at his palace. After
this he went the round of his workshops, overlooking each one’s
work and directing its progress. At the hour of nine he dined with
his clerks. There was no worldly pomp observable at his table,
but a religious silence, all being required to listen to the reading,
which was made aloud. The barbarians gave him plenty of trouble,
for they had seized possession of both shores of the Elbe, and were
therefore able to enter Saxony whenever they liked, and often
appeared at the gates of Hildesheim. But Bernward raised troops
for the defence of his diocese, and repeatedly forced them to retire;
and at last built and garrisoned two strong fortresses which kept the
pirates in check.</p>

<p>Bernward had many illustrious disciples, and among them was one
destined to be known in history as the Apostle of the Sclaves. The
title may puzzle those readers who have met with other and earlier
narratives of the conversion of these people, but the fact is that the
Sclaves absorbed almost as much Apostolic labour as China has
done in later times. Twice converted they had twice apostatised,
and were finally brought within the fold of the Church by the labours
of Bennon, Bishop of Misnia. This remarkable man belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
family of the counts of Saxony, and was placed under the care of
St. Bernward at the age of five years. The restored monastery of
Hildesheim, dedicated to St. Michael, of course possessed its school,
which was presided over by Wigger, a very skilful master, under
whose careful tuition Bennon thrived apace. “<em>Now as the age
was learned</em>,” writes the good canon, Jerome Enser&mdash;who little
thought in what light that same age would come to be regarded&mdash;“as
the age was learned, and cultivated humane letters, as may be
seen by the lives and writings of so many eminent men, Wigger
would not allow the child committed to his care to neglect polite
letters;” so he set him to work at once to learn to write, being careful
to transcribe his copies himself. And how well Bennon profited
from these early lessons might yet be seen by any who chose to
examine the fine specimens which were preserved in the Church of
Misnia when Jerome Enser wrote his biography. After this Wigger
exercised his pupil in the art of reading and that of composing
verses, taking care to remove from his way everything offensive to
piety or modesty. Bennon had a natural gift of versification, and
soon learnt to write little hymns and poems by way of amusement.
His progress and his boyish verses endeared him to his masters, and
indeed, adds Jerome, “he was beloved by God and man.” None
showed him more affection than St. Bernward, who was now overwhelmed
with the infirmities of old age, though his mind was as
bright and active as ever. During the last five years of his life he
was entirely confined to his bed, and all this time little Bennon
proved his chief solace. Sometimes he read aloud to his beloved
father. Sometimes he made verses, or held disputations to entertain
him; never would he leave his side, discharging for him all the
offices of which his youth was capable. When at last death drew
near, Bernward called the child to him together with his master
Wigger, and addressed to him a touching exhortation. “If by reason
of thy tender age,” he said, “thou canst not thyself be wise, promise
me never to depart from the side of thy preceptor that he may be
wise for thee, and that so thou mayest be preserved from the corruptions
of the world whilst thy heart is yet soft and tender. Yea,
if thou lovest me, love and obey him in all things, as holding the
place of thy father.” Then he kissed the child’s little hand, and
placed it in that of Wigger, and soon after departed this life, rich in
good works, and secure of a heavenly reward.</p>

<p>The sorrow of Bennon was too great for words. He wept without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
ceasing, and pined away in his grief, till at last Wigger had to mingle
his consolations with timely reprehension. His words in some degree
restored his pupil to peace, but so deep an impression had been
made on his heart of the nothingness of a world which sooner or
later deprives us of all we most love, that he resolved to have nothing
more to do with it, and to devote his life to God in the monastery.
He never forgot his good father Bernward, and the first composition
which he wrote after the death of the bishop was a poetical epitaph
which his biographer inserts, and which is not a favourable specimen
of his genius. Jerome probably felt that it was open to criticism,
which he judiciously forestalls. “The verses,” he says, “show that
if not ignorant of the metrical art, he did not affect a flowery style,
but was content with plain and simple language. But if some, having
delicate ears, should be disposed to turn up their noses at the line,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Quem Deus Emmanuel diligat, et Michael.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“I would remind them of the singular devotion which the Blessed
Bernward bore to St. Michael whence it will appear that this line
did not escape our Bennon unwarily. They who are moved by the
Spirit of God care not much for the outside shell of words, and
prefer a good life to a good style of writing.” He adds, “the
scholastic discipline of Hildesheim was at this time extremely severe.
It was reckoned a great fault not merely to be absent from choir or
refectory, but even to come late. The scholars each day had to bring
their Scripture to the dean, and rehearse their Psalms. And the rod
was freely used.” Bennon being kept under this strict discipline,
passed safely through the slippery time of youth, and in his after-life
proved himself not unworthy the extraordinary care bestowed on his
education.</p>

<p>Many other great prelates of this period might be enumerated,
distinguished either as the founders or the masters of schools. Of
Notger of Liege we have already spoken. The school of Verdun
was founded by one of his disciples, and boasted of possessing that
wonder of the eleventh century, Master Herminfrid, who spoke and
wrote with equal facility Latin, Greek, French, German, and Italian.
Then there was St. Meinwerc, who like Bennon was a pupil of
Hildesheim, where he studied along with his cousin St. Henry of
Bavaria, and the prince, even after he became Emperor, remembered
their schoolboy days together, and was fond of putting him in mind
of them by sundry tricks that savoured of the grown-up schoolboy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Meinwerc was not much of a scholar himself, but when he became
Bishop of Paderborn, he showed a laudable zeal in promoting good
scholarship among his clergy. In fact, he was the founder of those
famous schools of Paderborn which are described as flourishing in
divine and human science, and which were perfected by his nephew
and successor, Imadeus. The boys were all under strict cloistral
discipline; there were professors of grammar, logic, rhetoric, and
music; both the trivium and quadrivium were there taught, together
with mathematics, physics, and astronomy. Horace, Virgil, and
Statius were read by the students, whose ordinary recreation it was
to make verses, while great attention was paid to the arts of writing
and painting. Brucker treats this account as apocryphal, on the
ground that Meinwerc was an <em>ignoramus</em> himself, and sometimes
made blunders in reading Latin. The story of Bishop Meinwerc
and his mules, the only one, be it remembered, on which this charge
of ignorance is founded, together with the explanation of the same
so amusingly given by Mr. Maitland in his “Dark Ages,” need not
here be repeated. When emperors take to playing tricks, even the
wisest of bishops may be snared into a blunder. But granting the
fact that Meinwerc himself possessed no more scholarship than our
own Wykeham, there seems no reason for supposing it therefore
impossible that he should desire to rear a race of students more
learned than himself. We know that he was a strict disciplinarian
in all that regarded the right discharge of the sacred offices, and that
he was wont to examine and burn all incorrect copies of books used
at the altar, administering very sharp correction, in the shape of
stripes, to careless and negligent priests.</p>

<p>However, the object of the present chapter being chiefly to show
something of the interior of schools in the Dark Ages, we will pass
over a great many names of founders and learned bishops, and take
our way to Magdeburg, where Otho I. had erected a cathedral, and
Archbishop Adalbert had founded a school. Here, in 973, the yet
more famous St. Adalbert of Prague was sent by his parents for
education. They were of the Bohemian nation, and had vowed to
offer their son to God should he recover of a dangerous sickness.
Before he left his father’s house he had learnt the Psalter, and under
Otheric, the famous master then presiding over the school of Magdeburg,
he made as much progress in sanctity as in learning. He had
a habit of stealing away from the schoolroom in the midst of his
studies to refresh his soul with a brief prayer in the church, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
which he hastened back and was safe in his place again before the
coming of the master. To conceal his acts of charity from the eyes
of others, he chose the night hours for visiting the poor and
dispensing his abundant alms. It often happened that when Otheric
was out of the school, the boys would divert themselves with games
more or less mischievous to relieve the weary hours of study. Adalbert
seldom took part in these pastimes, neither would he share in those
stealthy little feasts which they sometimes held in obscure corners,
where they contrived to hide from Otheric’s quick eye the sweets
and other dainties furnished them, as we must suppose, by some
medieval tart-woman.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> However, if Adalbert was proof against this
last-named temptation, it appears he was not altogether superior to
the love of play, and that when his master’s back was turned, he did
occasionally throw aside his books and indulge in a game of ball.
When such delinquencies came to the ears of Otheric, he did not
spare the rod, and on these occasions, observes his biographer with
cruel pleasantry, Adalbert was often known to speak in three languages.
For it was a strict rule that the boys were always to talk
Latin in the schoolroom, and never allow the ears of their master to
catch the sound of a more barbarous dialect. When the rod was
produced, therefore, Adalbert would begin by entreating indulgence
in classic phraseology, but so soon as it was applied, he would call
out for mercy in German, and finally in Sclavonic. After nine years’
study at Magdeburg, Adalbert returned to Bohemia, with the reputation
of being specially well read in philosophy, and taking with him
a useful library of books, which he had collected during his college
career. After his consecration as Bishop of Prague, at the early age
of twenty-seven, he is said never again to have been seen to smile.
Twice the hard-heartedness of his people compelled him to abandon
his diocese, and after his departure the second time, he travelled as
missioner into the then heathen and barbarous provinces of Prussia,
where he met with his martyrdom in the year 997. A Sclavonic
hymn to the Blessed Virgin, formerly wont to be sung by the Poles
when going to battle, is attributed to this saint.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have spoken only of the episcopal seminaries of
Germany; those attached to the monasteries were, if possible, more
celebrated. The great school of St. Gall’s attained its highest degree
of splendour in this century. Something has already been said of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
the general character of the studies pursued there, but its succession
of great masters deserves a more particular notice. Originally
founded by Irish monks, the monastery owed no little of its renown
to the teaching of Irish professors. In the year 840, Marx, an Irish
bishop, travelling home from Rome in company with his nephew
Moengall, stopped at St. Gall’s, and after a few days’ visit, both of
them entreated the abbot to admit them into his community. Permission
being granted, they dismissed their servants and horses,
threw their money out of the window, and, keeping only their books
and sacred vessels, vowed to spend the rest of their lives in the
seclusion of the cloister. Moengall, to whom the monks gave the
less barbarous name of Marcellus, was soon after appointed master
of the interior or cloistral school, the exterior one being governed
by the famous master, Iso. This last-named personage, whom
Ekkehard styles a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">doctor magnificus</i>, enjoyed such a reputation that
all the monasteries of Gaul and Burgundy were eager to obtain his
disciples, and it was commonly said that he possessed ways of his
own for sharpening the dullest wits. At the precise time of which
we speak, he had among his pupils Solomon, afterwards Bishop of
Constance, and the three friends, Notker Balbulus, or the stammerer,
Ratpert, and Tutilo, all of whom afterwards chose the monastic
state, and passed, therefore, to the interior school, presided over by
Marcellus.</p>

<p>The Irish scholar greatly improved the system of studies; he
extended, if he did not first introduce, the study of Greek, and it is
evident that his influence, and that of many of his countrymen, who
filled subordinate professorships, may be traced in the character
which distinguished the education of St. Gall’s from that of most of
its contemporaries. It was larger and freer, and made more of the
arts and sciences; indeed, so far as regards its studies, it had a
better claim to the title of a <em>university</em> than any single institution
which can be named as existing before the time of Philip Augustus.
Marcellus was fortunate in his pupils, but the character of the three
who were most prominent among them must be given in the words
of Ekkehard. Though united in one heart, he says, they were of
very different dispositions. Notker was weak, not in mind but in
body; in speech, but not in spirit, a stammerer. Firm in spiritual
things, patient in adversity, mild to all, yet a strict disciplinarian, and
timorous at any sudden alarm, except of demons, whom he combated
valiantly. He was very assiduous in reading, writing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
composing, and was, in short, a vessel of the Holy Ghost. Very
different was Tutilo; he was a good and useful man; as to his arms
and all his limbs, such as Fabius teaches us to choose for a wrestler.
He was eloquent, with a fine voice, skilful in carving, and an excellent
painter. He was a musician, too, like his companions, and
excelled everybody in all kinds of stringed and wind instruments,
and taught their use to the sons of the nobility educated in the
exterior school. He was, moreover, a very wise builder, powerful
in reading and singing, cheerful whether in jest or earnest, and what
is more, ever diligent in choir; in secret, given to devout tears, and
skilful in the composition of songs and melodies. Ratpert was
something between the two: from his youth he had been schoolmaster
of the external school, where he succeeded Master Iso, and a
kind, straightforward teacher he was, very strict in discipline, and so
seldom given to go abroad that, he made one pair of shoes last a
twelvemonth. He was very famous as a poet, and so fond of the
ancients that he was known, even in chapter, to quote a verse from
Virgil. He died some years before either of his friends; and forty
of his former pupils, all of them priests or canons, stood around his
deathbed, and promised each one to say thirty masses for the repose
of his soul, a thing which gave him infinite joy and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Tutilo was a good classical scholar, and could preach both in
Greek and Latin; but he was chiefly esteemed as an artist and a
musician. He sang his own melodies to the harp, an instrument
which the Irish monks had rendered very popular at St. Gall’s. His
magnificent statuary in bronze and stone continued to decorate the
abbey church till the time of its pillage by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> reformers,
and all the French and German prelates were eager to obtain his
works. With the permission of his abbot, therefore, he travelled far
and wide, executing devout carvings and paintings, much to the
dissatisfaction of Ratpert, who was wont to say that this gadding
about the world was the destruction of a monk. It did not, however,
prove so with Tutilo, who, to all his brilliant genius and gigantic
muscular strength, united in a singular degree the grace of humility.
Whenever he found that his artistic skill drew on him any notable
amount of admiration, he generally found some excuse for departing
from the place where he was at work, and his long journeys never
lessened his devotion, or deprived him of his gift of holy tears. It
was his custom to adorn his sculptures and pictures with pious verses,
in order to draw the thoughts of those who beheld them from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
work of the artist to the divine mystery which it represented. One
of his most celebrated pieces of sculpture was an image of the Blessed
Virgin, which he carved for the cathedral at Metz. Whilst engaged
on this masterpiece, two pilgrims came up and begged an alms of him,
and having received it, asked of a clerk who was standing by, who
that beautiful lady was whom they saw at his side, holding his compasses,
and directing him in his work. The clerk looked, and saw
the same wondrous vision, and believed it to be Our Lady herself
who had come in person to assist her client. But when the rumour
of the thing spread abroad, Tutilo fled away, nor could he ever be
persuaded to return to the city. His verses were highly esteemed,
and some of his elegies are still preserved. Besides all this, he was
great in mathematics and astronomy, and constructed an astrolabe
which showed the course of the stars. For it must be remembered
that scientific studies were highly prized at St. Gall’s, and that even
geographers were to be found among the monks, such as Abbot
Hartmot, who constructed a large map of the world, in those days
a very rare and valuable curiosity.</p>

<p>Among these three famous scholars, we may select Notker as the
most perfect specimen of the monastic type. Like his two friends,
he was a poet and musician, and his brethren considered him a
second Horace for the beauty of his songs and sequences. It was
the reputation of learning enjoyed by St. Gall’s which had first
attracted him thither, for indeed, says Ekkehard, “he was devoured
with a love of grammar.” Like a true poet, he was keenly susceptible
to the sights and sounds of nature, and loved to “study her beautifulness”
in that enchanted region of lakes and mountains. The gentle
melancholy inseparable from exalted genius, which in him was
increased by his exceeding delicacy of organisation, found its expression
in the wild and mystic melodies which he composed. The
monotonous sound of a mill-wheel near the abbey suggested to him
the music of the “Media Vita,” the words being written whilst looking
into a deep gulf over which some labourers were constructing a
bridge. This antiphon became very popular in Germany, and was
every year sung at St. Gall’s during the Rogation Processions. But
it was not as a poet or man of science that the Blessed Notker was
best known to posterity; profoundly learned in human literature, he
yet, says Ekkehard, applied more to the Psalter than to any other
book. Even in his own lifetime he was revered as a saint. He was
master of the interior and claustral school at the same time as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Ratpert governed the exterior school, and kept up the same strict
discipline, “stripes only excepted.” The gentleness of his disposition
peeps out in the fact that one of the faults he was hardest on in his
pupils was the habit of bird’s-nesting. He was always accessible;
no hour of day or night was ever deemed unseasonable for a visit
from any who brought a book in their hands. For the sake of maintaining
regular observance, he once forbade his disciples to whisper
to him in time of silence, but the abbot enjoined him under
obedience to let them speak to him whenever they would. Ratpert
relates a story of him, which shows the opinion of learning and
sanctity in which he was held. The emperor Charles, having on
one occasion come to the monastery on a visit, he brought in his
suite a certain chaplain, whose pride appears to have taken offence
at the consideration with which his master treated the Blessed
Notker. When they were about to depart, therefore, seeing the
man of God sitting, as was his custom, with his Psalter in his hand,
and recognising him to be the same man who, on the previous day,
had solved many hard questions proposed to him by Charles, he
said to his companions, “There is he who is said to be the most
learned man in the whole empire; but if you like, I will make this
most excellent wiseacre a laughing-stock for you, for I will ask him a
question which, with all his learning, he will not be able to answer.”
Curious to see what he would do, and how Notker would deal with
him, they agreed to his proposal, and all went together to salute the
master, who courteously rose, and asked them what they desired.
Then said the unhappy man of whom we spoke, “O most learned
master, we are very well aware that there is nothing you do not
know. We therefore desire you to tell us, if you can, what God is
now doing in heaven?” “Yes,” replied Notker, “I can answer
that question very well. He is doing what He always has done,
and what He is shortly about to do to thee, He is exalting the
humble, and humbling the proud.” The scoffer moved away, while
the laugh was turned against him. Nevertheless, he made light of
Notker’s words and the prediction of evil which they seemed to contain
regarding himself. Presently the bell rang for the king’s departure,
and the chaplain, mounting his horse, rode off with a great
air in front of his master. But before he came to the gate of the
city the steed fell, and the rider being thrown on his face, broke his
leg. Abbot Hartmot hearing of this accident, desired Notker to
visit the sick man, and pardon him, giving him his blessing. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
the foolish chaplain protested that the misfortune had nothing to do
with Notker’s prediction, and continued to speak of him with the
greatest contempt. His leg, however, remained in a miserable state,
until one night his friends besought Notker to come to him and aid
him with his prayers. He complied willingly enough, and touching
the leg, it was immediately restored; and by this lesson the chaplain
learned to be more humble for the future.</p>

<p>Notker was the author of various works, amongst others of a
German translation of the Psalter, which Vadianus speaks of in his
treatise on the “Ancient Colleges of Germany,” and which he says
is scarcely intelligible by reason of the excessive harshness of the old
Tudesque dialect. He gives a translation of the “Creed,” and the
“Our Father,” from Notker’s version, in which it is not difficult to
trace the German idiom.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Notker’s German studies were yet more
extensively carried on by his namesake, Notker Labeo, or the Thick-Lipped,
who wrote many learned works in the vernacular, and was
also a great classical scholar. He translated into German the works
of Aristotle, Boëthius, and Marcian Capella, and some musical
treatises, all which are still preserved. His translation of St.
Gregory’s “Morals” is lost. He is commemorated in the chronicles
of his House as “the kind and learned master,” and whilst he presided
over the claustral school, he educated a great many profound
scholars, among whom was Ekkehard junior, the author of the
chronicle “De Casibus S. Galli,” and of the celebrated “Liber
Benedictionum.” This Ekkehard, at the request of the empress,
transcribed Notker’s “Paraphrase of the Psalms” for her use with
his own hand, and corrected a certain poem which his predecessor
Ekkehard I. had written when a schoolboy, and which was full of
Tudesque barbarisms, such as the delicate ear of Ekkehard junior
might not abide. He held that the barbarous idioms could not be
translated into Latin without a great deal of painstaking. “<em>Think</em>
in German,” he would say to his scholars, “and then be careful to
render your thought into correct Latin.” There was yet a third
Ekkehard whose memory is preserved in the annals of St. Gall under
the surname of <em>Palatinus</em>. He was nephew to Ekkehard I., and
presided over both the exterior and interior schools, and that with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
great success. He made no distinction between noble and plebeian
scholars, but employed those who had less talent for learning in
writing, painting, and other like arts. He was able to take down in
shorthand the substance of anything he heard, and two discourses
are still preserved thus noted by his hand. He was afterwards most
unwillingly summoned to the Court of Otho I., who appointed him his
chaplain and secretary, and tutor to his son Otho II. So venerated
was this great man throughout Germany, that when he attended
the council of Mentz in 976, six bishops rose up to salute their old
master, all of them having been educated in the school of St. Gall.
To this list of masters I must add the name of another Notker, who,
from his strict observance of discipline, received the surname of
“Piperis-granum,” or the Peppercorn, though his pungency of temper
did not prevent his brethren from commemorating him in their
obituary as the “Doctor benignissimus.” He was renowned as a
physician, a painter, and a poet, and was also well skilled in music.
Most of these great men find a place in a narrative which I will give
here for the sake of its connection with the classical studies of St.
Gall, and which is related by Ekkehard junior in his chronicle of
the abbey.</p>

<p>Hedwiga, daughter to Duke Henry of Bavaria, was at that time
the reigning Duchess of Swabia, having been left a widow by the
death of her husband Duke Burkhard. She was a woman of wonderful
beauty, but of so severe and imperious a temper as to be held in
terror through all the surrounding provinces. In her youth she had
been promised in marriage to the Greek prince, Constantine, who
sent a cunning artist to take the portrait of his future bride, and at
the same time to instruct her in Greek literature. But Hedwiga,
not admiring the Greek alliance, made such terrible contortions of
her fair nose and eyebrows whenever the painter applied himself to
his task, that his efforts at a likeness proved fruitless, and the marriage
was broken off in consequence. From the Greek painter, however,
Hedwiga had acquired a very fair proportion of Greek scholarship,
and on her marriage with Burkhard, she likewise applied herself to
the study of Latin. She was a frequent visitor to the abbey of St.
Gall, where her nephew, Burkhard, was then abbot, and in return
for her splendid gifts, insisted on nothing less than that the abbot
should make over to her, as tutor, the hapless Ekkehard Palatinus,
who then filled the office of porter, and was known to be an excellent
scholar in both languages. The abbot very unwillingly consented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
to her demand, and poor Ekkehard had to pay frequent visits to
the castle of Dwellia, where, in spite of the beauty and talents of
his fair disciple, her sharp temper and exasperating ways often made
his office a hard one. Once, when out of humility he had begged
that a certain canopy erected over his bed might be taken down,
the wrathful duchess ordered the servant who had executed the order
to be flogged, and would have cut off his head had it not been for
the entreaties of the master. However, she had an open hand,
though a somewhat heavy one, and bestowed liberal gifts on the
monks of St. Gall, in the shape of embroidered copes and chasubles.
But even in her bounty she showed the same wilful disposition, for
having once given them a very rich dalmatic, cunningly worked in
fine gold, and representing the espousals of Mercury and Philology,
she took it away again in dudgeon at the refusal of Abbot
Immo to let her have the antiphonary on which she had set her
heart.</p>

<p>The favours which St. Gall’s received at her hands, however,
and the frequent visits exchanged between the abbey and Dwellia
roused the jealousy of Ruodman, abbot of the neighbouring monastery
of Reichnau. He was a prying, gossiping sort of a personage, and set
afloat so many mischievous and ill-natured tales as greatly to distress
the monks. But this was not the worst. Not content with whispering
his calumnies, Ruodman conceived the plan of stealing into the
convent in the absence of Abbot Burkhard, to see if he could not
spy out some matter which he might turn to the disadvantage of the
inmates. On a certain day, therefore, mounting his horse he set out
for St. Gall, and arriving at the monastery about nightfall, stole into
the cloister and cautiously crept about spying this way and that to
see what he could discover. Having satisfied his curiosity by an
inspection of the cloister, he proceeded on tiptoe upstairs to the
dormitory, but not so softly but that the watchful ear of Dean Ekkehard,
the senior, caught the sound. Quietly providing himself with
the abbot’s lantern, he followed the footsteps, and presently discovered
the intruder. Ere long the whole community was down upon him,
and I leave the reader to guess what were their sentiments when the
abbot’s lantern displayed the features of the trembling Ruodman.
The younger part of the monks were earnest in their entreaties that
he might be chastised as his impertinence merited, and some of them
ran forwith to provide themselves with rods. The unhappy Ruodman,
in great anguish of soul, implored their mercy: “Spare me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
good youths!” he exclaimed; “I am in your hands, deal with me
gently, or at least wait to hear the judgment of your dean:” for at
that moment Ekkehard senior was consulting with the elder fathers
what was to be done in so strange an emergency. Meanwhile
Notker, the Peppercorn, appeared on the scene, and his voice was
for summary measures. “O wicked man!” he exclaimed, “dost
thou go about as a lion, seeking whom thou mayest devour, and like
another Satan, desiring to accuse thy brethren?” But he, cunningly
taking advantage of the known mildness of the good dean, threw
himself entirely on his mercy. “Most prudent father,” he exclaimed,
“I have indeed done very wickedly; but lo! I repent, I ask pardon
of everybody, and from henceforward I will utterly abstain from molesting
any of you.” The kind-hearted monks were touched by his
speedy repentance; some indeed regretted that he should be let off
without receiving a severe lesson, but the voices of the seniors prevailed,
and Ruodman was conducted by Ekkehard himself to the spot
where his horse awaited him, and dismissed in peace and forgiveness.</p>

<p>My readers will probably be of opinion that he got off very easily.
So was Abbot Burkhard when he heard of the affair, though he was
far from being of a pugnacious temper; and so too was the mighty
duchess. The next time that Ekkehard Palatinus appeared to give
his lesson, she vented her wrath in very strong language; to be candid,
she swore, “by the life of Hedwiga,” to have her revenge. But her
anger for that day, at least, was dissipated by a pleasant incident
which sets her character in a more amiable light. Ekkehard had
brought with him one of his junior scholars, whose infantine beauty
attracted the admiration of the duchess. “Wherefore have you
brought this child?” she inquired of her tutor; who replied with
his customary courtesy, “For the sake of the Greek, gracious lady,
which I hope he will gather from your lips.” Then the boy, who
was well trained in the versifying habits of the St. Gall’s scholars,
spoke for himself in an extempore line of Latin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Esse velim Græcus, cum sim vix, Dom’na, Latinus.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Charmed with his ready wit, she drew him to her, and kissing him
kindly on the forehead made him sit on the footstool at her feet,
requiring him to make her some more verses immediately. The
child, confused with these unwonted caresses, looked first at one
and then at the other of his teachers, and then stammered out,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">

    <div class="verse indent0">Nam nimis expavi Duce me libante suavi.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The severe heart of the duchess was fairly conquered, and making
the little poet stand up before her, she then and there taught him to
sing the antiphon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maria et flumina</i>, which she had herself translated
out of Latin into Greek, and frequently afterwards had him at her
castle and taught him how to make Greek verses. Moreover, she
treated him with a tenderness that went nigh to spoiling, and gave
him a Horace, and some other books which one wishes Ekkehard
junior had named, and which were long preserved in the library.
I will not pursue the story of Ruodman, which has been chiefly
introduced for the sake of this graceful ending. He had great
difficulty in making his peace with the abbot and the duchess,
though he tried the mollifying gift to the former of a very handsome
horse, which threw its rider the very first time he mounted it, so
that in spite of all the skill displayed by Notker Piperis-granum,
poor Abbot Burkhard went for some time after on crutches.</p>

<p>The school anecdotes of these times attest the familiar and
paternal relations which existed between the scholars and their
masters. The sports and enjoyments of the boys were amply provided
for, and we find mention of running, wrestling, swimming,
country walks, and fishing parties. Sometimes, as at Eton or
Harrow, a visit from royalty procured an extra play-day, and on
certain high festival days it is recorded that they were regaled with
wine and a choicer fare at dinner. Hartmann, one of the learned
disciples of Marcellus, retained such a liking for the school that
even when he became abbot he spent half his time among the boys.
And Solomon, the schoolfellow of Ratpert and Tutilo, who from
abbot became Bishop of Constance, in like manner never forgot his
old pupils, for he, too, had in his day held the ferule, being assistant
to Iso in the external school. On one occasion, paying a visit to
the abbey during the Christmas festival, on the day after Holy
Innocents, before going away he peeped into the school, and finding
the master absent walked into the midst of the boys to bid them all
good-bye. They were about him in a minute; and the knowing
ones among them lost no time in demanding their rights. There
was a custom of long standing in the school that when any stranger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
entered the schoolroom, he might be captured as a prisoner, and not
released till he had ransomed himself by a gift or favour. Undismayed
by the rank of their present visitor, they surrounded him with
daring familiarity, and declared him their captive. Good-naturedly
entering into their sport, he suffered them to do what they liked with
him; whereupon they led him to the master’s chair, and made him
understand that he should not come out thence till he had promised
them something handsome. “Very well,” he said, “as you have
put me in the master’s chair, I shall exercise the master’s authority;
prepare all of you to be flogged.” This was turning the tables on
them with a vengeance, but the boys were quick enough to find a
way of escape. “Be it so,” they replied, “only we claim to be
suffered to redeem ourselves as we do with our master.” “And
pray, how is that?” said the bishop. “By making verses, to be
sure,” they replied; and he agreeing to their terms, they proceeded
to spout little metrical compositions of their own, improvised for the
occasion, two of which are even yet preserved. Charmed with their
readiness, the bishop rose and kissed them all, one after the other.
“Yea, as I live,” he said, “I will surely ransom myself nobly.”
And so he did; for, calling the masters, he commanded that from
that day forward and for ever, the boys should every year have three
whole play-days after the Feast of Holy Innocents, and that on each
of these days they should have meat dishes for dinner from the
abbot’s kitchen, which custom continued uninterruptedly till the
troubles occasioned by the Hungarian invasions.</p>

<p>This Abbot Solomon was a learned as well as a kind-hearted man.
He kept up a literary correspondence with two brother bishops,
Dado, of Verdun, and Waldram, of Strasburg, and most of the letters
that passed between them were in verse. He was, moreover, well
skilled in the arts, and no one succeeded so well as he in designing
the capitals for illuminated manuscripts; nay, even after he became
bishop, he did not think this occupation unworthy his episcopal
hand. He always kept up the same affectionate intercourse with St.
Gall’s and its scholars, and loved to encourage their studies and
amuse himself with their innocent freedoms. Nor was it only by
ecclesiastics drawn from the ranks of the community that these
marks of favour and interest were bestowed. All the great German
sovereigns understood the value of St. Gall’s, and frequently visited
it in person. Otho the Great was accustomed to say that he would
willingly break his imperial crown into fragments to preserve regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
observance in that abbey. His sagacious mind discerned the vast
benefits which must flow to his empire from the preservation in the
midst of it of such a centre of civilisation. So very solicitous was he
for the well-being of the monastery, that reports having reached him in
968 of a rumoured decay of discipline, he used his imperial authority
after the fashion of Charlemagne, and appointed a commission of
abbots and bishops to investigate the case. They gave a good report
of the state of the monastery; but the emperor, not yet satisfied,
dispatched Kebon, abbot of Lauresheim, and some others, to enforce
the observance of the Rule to the very letter. The only irregularity
which the commissioners could discover was, that the Sunday
chant was in too high a key, and that the Friday fast was too
rigorous. Otho did not fail to do justice to the monks, and paid
them a visit in person to console them for the trouble he had given
them by his royal commissioners. It is said that assisting with them
in choir, he let his stick fall as if by accident, and was edified to see
that not one head was turned to observe the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>Ekkehard relates another royal visit from King Conrad I., which
took place in 912. The king being at Constance on Christmas-day,
the bishop happened after dinner to speak of the processions which
were celebrated at that season at St. Gall’s. “Why should we not
go there to-morrow?” said the king; and his courtiers eagerly
assenting, the next day very early they set out in boats across the
lake, and so reached the abbey, where they spent three days. They
specially admired the procession of the children; and to test their
discipline, the king threw an apple among them, which none of them
so much as looked at, whereat he greatly wondered. He dined with
them in the refectory, and took pleasure in hearing the boys read in
succession. As they came down from the desk, he sent some gold
to be put into their mouths, which one of them spitting out again,
Conrad declared he would make an excellent monk. His visit
ended pleasantly to the children, for after causing himself to be
enrolled as a conscript brother, he granted the scholars three extra
play-days, and discharged the expenses of a great feast, furnishing the
pepper, as he said, to season their beans. When Conrad II. and his
empress paid a similar visit in 1033, they contrived to coax Abbot
Dietbald to give them the German Psalter and the book of Job,
which had been written out by Notker Labeo, a treasure worth more
to the community than many such instalments of royal pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>I have lingered so long on the history of St. Gall’s as to leave
little space for noticing the other monastic schools of the period.
Most of those in Germany were remarkable for their cultivation of
the arts, in which they far outstripped their Italian contemporaries.
Godeschard, the successor of St. Bernward of Hildesheim, thoroughly
shared his tastes, and carried on his designs. He even founded a
school of painting in his episcopal palace which propagated the art
through all the German dioceses. The subjects chosen were mostly
scenes from the Old and New Testaments, being professedly intended
for the instruction of the unlearned. Rio fixes the latter part of the
tenth century as the date of the invention of glass painting, and the
first fabrication of carpets and hangings. These new branches of
industry were at once taken up by the monks, and at St. Florent de
Saumur, in 985, a manufactory was established for weaving tapestries
adorned with flowers and figures of animals. Sometimes the love of
nature, so inherent in the monkish soul, induced them to decorate
their cloisters with woodland scenes, in which the figures of men,
dogs, horses, and deer, appear taking part in the chase. This was,
of course, a departure from the principles on which the art of religious
painting rested; and in the twelfth century these artistic caprices
drew down severe reproofs from St. Bernard, who particularly disliked
the representation of monsters, such as centaurs, and quadrupeds with
a fish’s tail. He thought that they savoured of heathenism, and were
unsuitable to the gravity of a religious house. Hugo, of St. Victor,
objected even to the natural designs of sheep and oxen; “It may be
well,” he said, “that monasteries should have paintings for the edification
of those who are not delighted with Scriptural subtleties, but
for monks themselves a horse or an ox is more useful in the fields
than in a picture.” These landscape subjects were, however, exceptional;
far more frequently the monastic paintings were of a character
described in their annals as “solemn pictures.” They were pathetic
representations of the Sacred Passion, accompanied with pious verses,
not without a reference to the part of the convent where they were
fixed. Thus, in the lavatory, the monks were bid not to wash their
hands only, but their hearts also; in the refectory, to remember the
gall and vinegar which Our Lord received on the Cross; and in the
cloister, to think how the fashion of this world flees past us with
noiseless step. The great abbey of St. Denis, in France, was covered
all over with carvings and paintings, its very doors being sculptured
with the mysteries of the Passion and Resurrection; while within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
cloister was a whole series of paintings, historical and mystical, some
of the latter exceedingly quaint, such as that which represented St.
Paul turning a mill, and all the prophets of the Old Testament
bringing a sack of corn to be ground in it; figuring thereby his gift
in the interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures of the Old Law.</p>

<p>One thing cannot be overlooked whilst studying the annals of these
early monastic schools; it is the peculiar charm attaching to the
character of the masters. Everywhere we see the same features of
cheerful labour, and a certain tranquil activity. Turn to the newly
converted land of Normandy, and hear how Oderic Vitalis describes
the abbots and masters of his own monastery of St. Evroult. In one
page he paints the good abbot Theodoric, a very skilful scribe, who
managed to collect a fine library, partly by the diligent exercise of
his own pen and the labours of his youths, and partly by “gentle
solicitations.” Then there was Osbern, eloquent in speech, with a
lively genius for sculpture, architecture, and painting. How we seem
to behold him with “his stately stature, and his head, profusely
covered with black hair sprinkled with grey!” He was always urging
the novices to make progress in reading, singing, and writing; and
loved with his own hands to make the writing implements and waxen
tablets for the use of the boys. Or shall he tell us of that most
promising scholar, William, who was placed in the abbey when nine
years old, and was so diligent at his books, that the monks called
him Gregory the Second? Not only did he make an excellent reader
and chanter, and an exceedingly skilful copyist, but he was so devoted
a student of the Scriptures, that he committed to his tenacious
memory the Epistles of St. Paul, the Proverbs of Solomon, and many
other books of either Testament.</p>

<p>Of another youth, who began his education at five, and who afterwards
became schoolmaster, the same historian remarks, that his
special gift lay in his powers of conversation. He had a knack of
making everything interesting, and told the commonest things in a
way that was quite delightful; and the monks were never weary of
hearing him recite the narratives of Scripture, or the histories of
learned men. It is not merely as men of learning that the character
of these monastic students claims our admiration. It is the union
of strength with tenderness, of scholarship with humility, which
renders them so dear and venerable in our eyes. How seldom in
these records are we disgusted with any of those traits of pedantry
and self-seeking, the offsprings of a pride which had been pruned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
away by the knife of religious discipline? The monks were not mere
scholars, and the tendency to literary conceit was effectually corrected
by the daily exercises of community life. In the best days of
monasticism, labour was cultivated hand in hand with letters. The
same man who at one hour was engaged in writing a commentary on
the Scriptures, producing Christian imitations of Horace or Virgil, or
elaborating some of the exquisite master-pieces of cloistral art, found
himself at another, employed on the meanest and humblest offices
for the service of his brethren. The finest glass-painter of one
medieval convent had to leave his paintings to take their chance in
the furnace, while he was sent on the quest; and the Pope’s messengers
who brought a cardinal’s hat to another learned friar, found
him busy in the kitchen. This was the invariable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">régime</i> which
existed wherever the monastic institute preserved its discipline uncorrupted.
Thus Odericus says of Roger de Warrene, son of the
famous earl of Surrey, that entering the abbey of St. Evroult at the
age of forty-six, he never plumed himself on his noble birth or varied
accomplishments, but chose rather base employments, “cleaning the
shoes of the brethren, washing their stockings, and cheerfully doing
other services which appear mean to stupid or conceited persons.”
Yet he was a very skilful artist; and when he had finished with the
shoes and stockings, he gave the rest of his time to the labours of the
scriptorium, where he ornamented a book of the Gospels with gold,
silver, and precious stones. And the historian knows not how to say
enough of his pleasant and musical voice, his constant attendance in
choir, and his courteous manner with the other monks, “always
abstemious towards himself, always generous to others, always alive
for vigils, and incredibly modest.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> What a fragrant sweetness hangs
about such notices as these, coming as they do in the midst of
records of bloodshed and violence! Truly, we may say of the monastic
schools, that they were “as beds of flowers by the dens of lions
encompassed!” Huns and Saracens raged around them, but these
gentle scholars fled to the mountains and the wilderness, and building
their nests amid the rocks, while the world was flooded by new
forms of barbarism, they wrote, they studied, they taught, and they
prayed, and perpetuated that beautiful character which even Michelet
has owned to have been in all ages the appanage of monks; sweetness,
goodness of heart, and innocence. It remained wholly unaffected
by the stormy turbulence of the world around them. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
had a world of their own apart from and above it. All Europe
might be in arms, whilst at St. Gall’s Tutilo was constructing his
wonderful table, which showed all the courses of the stars, or Notker
was composing those hymns and sequences which for centuries afterwards
were to be incorporated into the Office of the Church.
Whilst the barbarians were laying all things in ruins, they, heedless
alike of fame or profit, were patiently laying the foundations of
European civilisation. They were forming the languages of Schiller,
of Bacon, and of Bossuet; they were creating arts which modern
skill in vain endeavours to imitate; they were preserving the codices
of ancient learning, and embalming the world, “lying in wickedness,”
with the sweet odour of their manifold virtues. Surely, it was of such
as these that the Wise Man spoke when he described that wisdom
which God has given to His chosen ones. For they had received
“the true knowledge of the things that are: the revolutions of the
year, and the dispositions of the stars; the natures of living creatures,
the reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of
roots,”&mdash;and in them was “the spirit of understanding, holy, one,
manifold, eloquent, active, undefiled, sweet, loving that which is
good, beneficent, gentle, and kind.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>But before closing our sketch of the tenth century, we have yet to
speak of its greatest scholastic glory: one whose attainments have
elicited not only the admiration of his contemporaries, but the
respectful notice even of those writers least disposed to believe that
anything good can come out of the Dark Ages. The scholars of
whom we have hitherto spoken, if regarded as great men by their
contemporaries, are spoken of by later critics with very general
contempt. They do not even allow them to have been useful in
their own poor way, as transcribers of volumes that they scarce knew
how to read, for Mr. Berington considers that even as copyists, the
monks were sadly idle. Two names, however, escape the otherwise
universal oblivion to which such writers would willingly consign the
scholars of the Dark Ages, they are Erigena Scotus and Gerbert.
There is, I hope, no malice in supposing that the intellectual
superiority of these men does not form their only claim to exemption
from the obloquy so plentifully heaped on their fellow-students.
The independent views of Erigena were well fitted to win him favour
with all disciples of the Rationalistic school; whilst the <em>supposed</em>
circumstance of Gerbert having acquired his knowledge of science<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
in an Arabic, and not in a Christian, academy, to say nothing of his
having been at one time involved in a dispute with the Holy See,
may have had some share in procuring him a larger meed of indulgence.
To admit his merit did not entail the necessity of giving
any credit to the Christian teachers, for if Gerbert ended his days
on the chair of St. Peter, it is at least a comforting reflection to our
historians, that he began life in the Moorish schools of Granada.</p>

<p>This consolation, alas! they enjoy no longer. Modern researches,
which have upset so many time-honoured traditions, have proved
beyond the possibility of dispute that Gerbert owed nothing either
to Moors or Pagans, that his education was exclusively Christian,
and that whatever be his value as a man of science, the Christian
schools of the Iron century must bear the credit of it. It is hard to
dissipate fables so romantic as those which represent the young
scholar Gerbert enabled, through the favour of a fair Moorish
damsel, to gain possession of her wizard father’s conjuring-book, the
mystic Abacus&mdash;and return to Europe with the unholy treasure,
which was to infuse a gleam of Saracenic light into the dull intellects
of Christendom. But the recent discovery of an authentic memoir
of this famous monk, whose name casts so broad a splendour over
his age, written by his own disciple, Richer, of Rheims, has cleared
away every obscurity which hitherto hung over his history.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Few particulars of his early life are known, save that he was the
son of poor parents, that he was a native of Aurillac in Auvergne,
and entered the monastery of that town when still a youth, about the
end of the ninth century. He had already commenced his studies in
grammar, when Borrel, count of Barcelona, came to the monastery
on pilgrimage. The abbot, hearing from him of the excellent schools
which then flourished in Spain, begged him to take back with him
some of their young monks, and Gerbert accordingly accompanied
the count into Spain, and was placed under Hatto, then Bishop of Vich,
in Catalonia, where he formed an intimate friendship with Warin,
abbot of Cusan, one of the most learned men of his time. From this
account, the authenticity of which is beyond question, it appears that
the popular notion which represents Gerbert as acquiring his learning
among the Arabs is incorrect, and all the romantic stories connected
with his acquisition of the mysterious Abacus vanish into thin air.
Doubtless, the Christian schools of Spain profited not a little from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
their proximity to the Arabic universities, and the sciences of mathematics
and astronomy were naturally those which were most successfully
cultivated. Gerbert made extraordinary progress in both; and
when he accompanied Borrel and Hatto on their next pilgrimage to
Rome, Pope John XIII. was not long in discovering his talents. The
liberty of the subject seems not to have been much understood in the
tenth century, for when it became known that the young monk was
an adept both in music and mathematics, neither of which sciences
were then taught in Italy, the Pope lost no time in communicating
the fact to the emperor Otho I., who conjured him not to permit his
return to Spain. Gerbert was accordingly most affectionately kidnapped
and sent without delay to Otho’s court, where being interrogated
as to the extent of his knowledge, he replied that he was tolerably
acquainted with mathematics, but was ignorant of logic, which
science he greatly desired to study. It happened that at that time
Gerard, archdeacon of Rheims, an excellent logician, had been sent as
ambassador to Otho from Lothaire, king of France, and Gerbert at
last won the emperor’s consent to his returning home with him, that
he might teach mathematics and study logic in the schools of that city.
Adalberon was then archbishop of Rheims, and he forthwith committed
the studies of his cathedral school to the direction of the
young professor. Richer gives a very precise account of the method
he followed. He began with the “Dialectics of Aristotle,” going
through and thoroughly explaining the propositions of each book. He
particularly explained the Introduction of Porphyry; and passed on
to the “Categories” and the “Topics” of the same author, as translated
out of Greek into Latin by Cicero, and commented on in six
books by the Consul Manlius. In the same way he lectured on the
four books of Topical differences, two of Categorical syllogisms, one
book of Divisions, and one of Definitions. And here the reader will
not fail to observe that these logical lectures must have been the
fruit of studies pursued not in Spain, but in France, for previous to
Gerbert’s coming to Rheims, we have his own acknowledgment that
he knew nothing of that science. After he had taken his scholars
through this course, says Richer, he proceeded to initiate them into
the art of rhetoric; and he set out on the principle, that in this
branch of study a knowledge of the classical poets was essential. He
therefore read and explained Virgil, Statius, and Terence; then the
satirists, Juvenal, Persius, and Horace, and last of all, Lucan. After
this, his pupils were exercised in disputation, which he taught with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
such art, that the art was never apparent; a thing, observes his biographer,
which is held to be the perfection of oratory. Then he
popularised the science of music;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and as to arithmetic, mathematics,
and astronomy, he made these difficult studies easy and
delightful. Richer devotes several pages to the description of the
various instruments which he constructed, and by which he contrived
to render the science of astronomy, as it were, sensible to the eyes of
his scholars. A round wooden ball, <em>with its poles oblique to the horizon</em>,
figured the world, the various astronomical and geographical phenomena
being represented by other circles. In fact, from the minute
description of the writer, we are obliged to conclude that Gerbert
exhibited at his lectures two very passable specimens of the terrestrial
and celestial globes. But the great boon, which he is commonly
represented as bestowing on the European schools, was the introduction
of that wonderful table, “in which nine ciphers represented all
the numbers, and produced in their infinite combinations all multiplications
and divisions.” This was the mystic <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abacus</i>, the foundation,
no doubt, of our present system of numeration. It consisted of a
tablet, on which three columns were marked out, sometimes in fixed
lines, sometimes in sand sprinkled over its surface; and in these
columns figures were arranged in units, tens and hundreds. The
method in use for working out calculations, even with the assistance
of this decimal system, as explained by Gerbert in several treatises,
was, however, extremely intricate, though it was probably a vast
improvement on the clumsy contrivances which had been resorted to
by former scholars. How far, however, the Abacus is to be regarded
as a new invention, appears more than doubtful. Its history has
been made the subject of interesting modern researches, and the
result seems to be that the system of numeration used and explained
by Gerbert, contained nothing in it which had been unknown to
Boëthius.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Nevertheless, he certainly seems to have elucidated and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
popularised the science of arithmetic, which from this epoch began
to be more seriously studied.</p>

<p>It is not easy to convey any notion of the enthusiasm excited by
Gerbert’s lectures, or the tide of scholars that flocked to him not
only from every part of France, but from Germany, Italy, and the
British Islands. Brucker is careful to repeat the old calumny, which
represents the dull heads of his contemporaries as attributing his
superior science to the effect of magic. “The knowledge of nature
which Gerbert possessed,” he says, “so far surpassed that of his contemporaries,
that they thought him possessed of magical powers;
<em>and Benno, a cardinal who owed him a grudge for his opposition to
the See of Rome</em>, invented a tale of his holding converse with the
devil.” Alas for the accurate historian! this round assertion must
go to keep company with that other from the same pen touching the
trial of Polydore Vergil before the Inquisition. It was, doubtless,
a temptation to represent the person who charged a man of genius
with being a magician as one of the dull orthodox, moved to the
malicious act by his zeal on behalf of the See of Rome, but the
facts are exactly the contrary. Benno, the zealous cardinal who
owed Gerbert a grudge for his opposition to the Pope, happened
himself to be a schismatic and a partisan of the anti-pope; and
instead of being a contemporary of Gerbert’s, he lived a century later,
in the time of St. Gregory VII., and introduced this precious story
in a writing, the express purpose of which was to defame the character
of the Roman pontiffs.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In justice to Gerbert it must be added,
that not only was he innocent of sorcery, but that he was altogether
above all petty jealousy and self-seeking, and desired nothing so
ardently as to communicate his discoveries to as many as wished
to receive them. Not content with instructing his own scholars, he
corresponded with the scholastics of Tours, Sens, Fleury, and
Aurillac, and spared no pains or expense in the collection of his
library. In this work he was generously assisted by his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
scattered over the length and breadth of Europe. It is in his
“Epistles” that we catch a glimpse of that prodigious activity of
mind which took cognisance of all subjects, and never rested till it
had sounded all to the depth. In one letter, we find him begging
the loan of a Cæsar from his archbishop, and offering in exchange
eight volumes of Boëthius and some excellent geometrical figures.
In another, he solicits the monks of Aurillac to furnish him with a
Spanish treatise on the arts of multiplication and division, and directs
them in the work of correcting a manuscript of Pliny. Then, again,
we find him writing on the medical science, to which he and his
disciples directed a good deal of attention, and in which they
followed the Greek masters. In fact, it was the diversified character
of his acquirements that made Gerbert the wonder of the world in
the eyes of his contemporaries. He knew all things, they said, and
all things equally well. If this were an exaggeration, it is certain
that he possessed the rare power of being able to direct his attention
to a very wide range of studies, though natural philosophy was
certainly his special attraction.</p>

<p>Whilst still presiding over his school, Gerbert produced several
treatises on astronomy, mathematics, and geometry; on the formation
of the astrolabe, the quadrant, and the sphere, as well as on
rhetoric and logic. The monk Ditmar tells us that when at Magdeburg
with his old pupil, Otho III., he made a clock, regulating it according
to the movement of the polar star, which he observed through a kind
of tube. Another writer speaks of certain hydraulic organs which
he constructed, in which the wind and necessary movements were
introduced by means of boiling water: and these obscure notices
seem to indicate that wheeled clocks, the telescope, and the power
of steam, were known by Gerbert fully three centuries before what
has been considered their earliest discovery by our own Roger Bacon.
Gerbert did not teach at Rheims alone. Crossing the Alps, he
passed through most of the towns of Northern Italy, then subject to
his great patron, Otho I. In 970 he also visited Rome in company
with the bishop Adalberon, and at Pavia met the emperor, together
with the celebrated Saxon, Otheric, whom we have seen filling the
office of scholasticus in the episcopal school of Magdeburg. Otheric
had up to that time enjoyed the reputation of being the greatest
scholar of his age, and perhaps regarded himself somewhat in the
light of a literary dictator. In the course of the previous year he
had felt no little uneasiness at the daily increasing renown of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
French professor, and had despatched one of his own Saxon pupils
to Rheims to bring him an exact account of Gerbert’s method of
dividing the sciences. The Saxon made an unsatisfactory report.
It was Gerbert’s custom to represent physics and mathematics as
equal and independent sciences. But Otheric’s disciple, whose
head was none of the clearest, made him teach that physics were
subordinate to mathematics, as the species to the genus. On this,
Otheric decided that he knew nothing of philosophy, and proceeding
to the court of the emperor, Otho I., he spoke to that effect before
an assembly of learned men. Otho, who was himself passionately fond
of these studies, was not satisfied, and resolved to sift the matter to
the bottom. He therefore seized the occasion of Gerbert’s presence
at Pavia to inaugurate a grand scientific tournament, and invited
all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">savants</i> of his empire to witness the dispute between the
first scholar of France and the first scholar of Germany. He himself
presided at the conference, and opened it with a brief allocution of
his own, in which he very clearly explained the question in dispute.
Then Otheric began his attack, first in words, and then in writing.
The conference lasted the whole day, and Gerbert, who cited the
authorities of Plato, Porphyry, and Boëthius, was still speaking in
reply when the emperor gave the signal for the conclusion of the
debate. Gerbert’s fame never appeared more illustrious, and he
returned to France loaded with magnificent presents.</p>

<p>His after career was full of troubles; but in 990 the influence of
his imperial pupil, Otho III., obtained his election to the see of
Ravenna, and nine years later to the Apostolic chair. It was a great
day in the annals of learning when the philosopher Gerbert became
Pope Sylvester II., and one which brought no small satisfaction to
the hearts of his pupils. Half the prelates and princes of Europe
gloried in having called him master, and most of them did him
credit. Among them were our own St. Ethelwold; Fulbert of
Chartres, the oracle of his own time; and Robert, king of France,
the son of Hugh Capet, and the most religious and learned sovereign
of the age. King Robert was well skilled in all the humane sciences;
but the love of music, which he had imbibed from his master,
amounted to a passion. Even after his accession to the throne, he
devoted no small part of his time to composing anthems, and motetts,
to the indignation of his queen, Constance, who asked him once, if
he must compose, to compose something upon <em>her</em>. Robert sat
down and produced the hymn <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O Constantia martyrum!</i> and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
queen, who fortunately understood nothing of Latin, was quite
satisfied, imagining that her own perfections formed the subject of
the poem. He often assisted in the choir of St. Denis, dressed in
his royal robes, singing with the monks and directing the chant.
Robert is said by his biographer always to have had a book in his
hand, and to have carried the Psalter in his bosom. He once
visited Rome, and during the Pope’s mass laid on the altar, as his
offering, a folded packet, which from its great size and weight the
attendants concluded to be gold. On opening it, however, they
found it to be only a fair copy of his antiphon, <em>Cornelius Centurio</em>.
Admiring the writing and the musical notes, as well as the genius and
piety of the author, the Pope desired that thenceforward this antiphon
should always be sung on the festival of St. Peter, of whose Office it
still continues to form a part.</p>

<p>Not less learned was Gerbert’s other royal pupil, Otho of Germany,
surnamed “the Wonder of the World,” whose early death prevented
his making as much use of his advantages of education as was confidently
expected by all who knew the singular excellence to which
he had attained. Besides these illustrious disciples, Gerbert had
others of every rank and calling. The great St. Ethelwold is said
by many writers to have studied under him for a time, and the rapid
development in England and elsewhere of mathematical studies at
this period must certainly be assigned to the impulse given them by
the teaching of the master of Rheims. His genius was emphatically
<em>scientific</em>, and this is the character which we find impressed on the
learning of most of his followers. Thus Richer, the monk from
whose history most of the above particulars have been taken, was
more particularly skilled in the science of medicine. As an instance
of the solicitude which monks of the tenth century displayed in the
pursuit of knowledge, I may refer to the very curious account which
he gives us of the perilous journey he once undertook, for the purpose
of perusing a single book on his favourite science. “It was
in the year 951,” says Richer, “when my mind, being much and
deeply engaged in the study of literature, I had long entertained an
ardent desire of having the opportunity of learning the logic of
Hippocrates of Cos. One day I chanced to meet in the city of
Rheims a horseman coming from Chartres. Asking him who he
was, and wherefore he had come hither, he replied that he was a
messenger from Heribrand, a clerk of Chartres, and that he wished
to speak to one Richer, a monk of St. Rémi. As soon as I heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
my friend’s name, and the subject of his message, I told the stranger
that I was the person he was in quest of; whereupon, having
embraced one another, he gave me a letter, which I found was an
invitation to come to Chartres and peruse the ‘Aphorisms.’ I was
much rejoiced at this; wherefore, taking a servant with me, I
determined on accompanying the horseman back to Chartres. The
only assistance I received from my abbot was a loan of one of the
draft horses. Without money, or even a change of clothes, and
destitute of every necessary for the journey, I set out and reached
Orbais, where I was not only delighted with the conversation of the
abbot, but greatly assisted by his noble gifts, so that next day I was
able to get on as far as Meaux. On entering the woods, however,
with my two companions, we were involved in several disasters; for,
deceived by its wild and broken openings, on coming to a place where
two ways met, we took the wrong turning, and were led six leagues
out of our road.</p>

<p>“By the time we passed Château Thierry my cart-horse, which
had at first seemed a sort of Bucephalus, began to lag on the road
as lazily as if he had been a donkey. The sun had been sinking
for some time, and the rain was falling fast. At this moment the
horse, worn out with fatigue, sank under the lad who was riding him,
and the poor beast expired, as though struck by lightning. This
happened when we were about six miles from the city of Meaux. My
agitation and anxiety at this disaster may be well conceived; the
boy, quite inexperienced in such emergencies, lay helpless on the
road, by the side of the dead horse. There lay the luggage also,
with no one to carry it; the rain was pouring down from a dark and
cloudy sky, and the sun was just on the horizon. By God’s goodness
a prudent thought, however, suggested itself to my mind. I
left the boy on the road with the baggage, telling him what he ought
to say if questioned by travellers, urging him not to yield to any
inclination to sleep. Then, accompanied by the horseman from
Chartres, I set out for Meaux. There was scarcely light to see the
bridge; and on examining it, a new misfortune presented itself. It
was so broken, and had such enormous holes in it, that even by
day it could hardly have been crossed in safety. The Chartres
horseman, however, here showed himself a ready man. After vainly
searching for a boat, he returned to the bridge, and, with the help
of God, succeeded in getting the horses over it. In some places he
covered the huge holes with his shield, so as to support the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
the animals; in others he put the separated planks close together,
and what with stooping, and what with holding himself erect, and
now keeping the beasts together, and now separating from them, he
contrived to get over in safety. It was a dreadful night, and all
around was buried in darkness when I reached the church of St.
Faro, where I was hospitably received by the monks, and refreshed
with kind words and abundance of food. The horseman was at
once sent back with other steeds, again passed the dangerous
bridge, and proceeded to search for the poor boy, whom we had
left on the road. It was the second watch of the night when he
came up with him. He at once brought him to the city, but fearful
of attempting a third time to cross the bridge they determined on
passing the night in a poor cabin, and at break of day appeared at
the gates of the monastery, half dead with hunger. Food was
immediately given them, and corn and straw supplied to the
horses.</p>

<p>“Leaving the dismounted boy with Abbot Augustin (of St. Faro),
I hastened on to Chartres with the horseman, whence I sent back
horses, who brought the lad back from Meaux. When he was
come, and my mind was thus set at rest, I sat down at once to the
earnest study of the ‘Aphorisms’ of Hippocrates, together with
Master Heribrand, a man as much distinguished for his politeness
as for his great learning. But as in these ‘Aphorisms’ I only learnt
the premonitory symptoms of diseases, and as this knowledge did
not satisfy me, I desired also to study another book showing the
concordance between Hippocrates, Galen, and Suranus. This also
I obtained from Heribrand, who was perfectly well skilled in the
science to which he devoted his time. Indeed, there was nothing
in medicine, pharmacy, botany, or surgery unknown to him.”
Richer’s appreciation of his friend’s learning may possibly have
been exaggerated; but who can fail to admire his perseverance in
overcoming such difficulties as a journey then presented, with the
simple view of increasing his stock of scientific knowledge by the
perusal of one precious book?</p>

<p>Allusion has been made to the improvements introduced by
Gerbert in the study of music. A little later a more important
addition was made to the same science by Guy, a monk of Pomposa,
commonly called Guy of Arezzo, from the city which gave
him birth. He had been educated from the age of eight years in
the monastery of Pomposa; and being well skilled in music, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
employed in teaching the ecclesiastical chant to the children brought
up in the house. But the immense difficulties of his task induced
him to consider whether some method of facilitating the notation of
music might not be devised. As yet, the sounds of the musical
scale were only represented by the first seven letters of the alphabet,
or by notes, as was the custom in the abbeys of Corby and St. Gall,
which showed indeed the relative length and value of each tone,
but did not render their succession sensible to the eye. After
seeking for a long time for some easy and precise system, Guy one
day recognised in the chant to which the hymn of St. John Baptist
was ordinarily sung, an ascending diatonic scale, in which the first
syllable of each line occupied one note: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut queant laxis</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Resonare
fibris</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mira gestorum</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Famuli tuorum</i>,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solve polluti</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Labii reatum</i>,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sancte
Ioannes</i>. He applied himself to teach this chant to
his pupils, and to render them familiar with the diatonic succession
of the syllables, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">re</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sol</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">la</i>. Next, he arranged the
notes on lines and intervals, and thus produced the musical staff
with its proper clefs. By means of these improvements he found
himself able, in a few months, to teach a child as much as a man,
under the ancient system, would have had difficulty in learning in
the course of many years. However, such a storm of jealousy arose
against him on the score of his discovery, that he found himself
obliged to leave the monastery; and accordingly, in 1024, he
travelled to Rome, where Pope John XIX. warmly received both
him and his newly-invented gamut.</p>

<p>“The Pope,” he says, “having received me kindly, conversed
with me for a long time, asking many questions, and turning over
the leaves of my antiphonarium, seemed to think it a sort of prodigy.
He conned its rules, and would not rise from his seat till he had
tried to learn a verse which he had never yet heard sung, and to
his great astonishment found himself able to do it.” Guy was not
allowed to leave Rome till he had promised to return the next
winter, and give a regular course of musical instructions to the Pope
and his clergy. The sunshine of Papal favour soon dissipated the
storm, but the humble religious was no way puffed up by his triumph.
He only rejoiced at being able to spread the knowledge of a discovery
which would be useful to others. “The designs of Providence,”
he writes, “are obscure, and falsehood is sometimes suffered
to oppress the truth; God so ordering it lest, puffed up with self-confidence,
we should suffer loss. For then only is what we do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
good and useful when we refer all we do to Him who made us.
God inspiring me with the knowledge, I have made it known to as
many as I could, to the end that if I, and those who have gone
before me, have learnt the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantus</i> with extreme difficulty, those who
come after me, doing so with greater facility, may pray for me and
my fellow-labourers, that we may obtain eternal life and the remission
of our sins.”</p>

<p>At the very time when Gerbert was astonishing the world by the
marvels of his genius, a simple nun of Gandersheim had attained a
degree of literary excellence, which is the more remarkable as it was
exclusively acquired within the enclosure of her own convent. The
foundation of this convent had taken place at the same time with
that of New Corby, and its object had been specially to provide for
the education of the Saxon ladies. Peculiar attention was therefore
directed to maintaining its school in a due state of efficiency, and
learned traditions were always kept up among the nuns. Having
fallen into decay in the ninth century, it was restored by Count
Lindolph, whose daughter, Hathmuda, became abbess in 856. Her
life has been left, written by her brother Agius, or Egbert. Hathmuda
was a great lover of letters. “From a child,” says her
brother, “she cared nothing at all for fine clothes, head-dresses,
ribbons, combs, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, handkerchiefs, girdles,
and scents, the possession and wearing of which stirs up the ambition
of so many women.” She preferred to pray and to study, and “the
lessons to which others had to be forced by stripes she willingly
applied herself to, giving herself up to them with indefatigable
ardour.” When she became abbess she was most desirous to keep
up those sacred studies for which the monastery had ever been so
famous. “She insisted on the study of the Scriptures, and those
who applied themselves to reading she greatly loved, but did not
admit to equal familiarity such as herein showed themselves to be
slothful.” Her cares were amply rewarded, and the school of Gandersheim
produced a succession of excellent teachers, among whom
was Hroswitha, the fourth abbess, who died in 906, and was the
authoress of a treatise on logic, much esteemed among the learned
of her own time.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>It is of a namesake of this fair logician that we are now about to
speak, Hroswitha, the nun of Gandersheim, as she is called. She
was born in the year 940, and was brought up in the convent school,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
where she studied Greek and Latin, the philosophy of Aristotle, and
the other liberal arts. We are often told that expressions like these,
however magnificent they look on paper, would dwindle into insignificance
could we test their value by the real amount of learning
which they represent. With regard to Hroswitha, however, the true
nature of her erudition is not left to conjecture. She has left behind
her writings which have attracted the favourable notice even of
modern critics, who agree in declaring that the Latin poems of this
obscure nun of the tenth century are marvels of classical taste and
poetic genius. Besides a panegyric on the three Othos, she wrote
eight poems on various religious subjects, some of them being taken
from the life of our Lord, and some from the legends of the saints;
and seven prose dramas in the style of Terence, being tales of holy
women, and having for their subject the praise of chastity. While
praising the delicacy of the sentiments and the correctness of the
style, her critics observe that these dramas afford incidental evidence
of her perfect familiarity with the sciences of music, astronomy, and
dialectics, as then taught in the schools. In one of them she
introduces a sort of apology for her own learning, which has a certain
feminine grace about it, more charming than all her logic. It occurs
in the drama of “Paphnutius,” where, after a philosophic discussion
on the art of music, one of the disciples of the saint is made to
ask him:</p>

<p>“Whence do you derive all this knowledge?” and he replies, “It
is but a little drop that I have gathered from the ever-flowing sources
of science; and now I desire to share it with you.”</p>

<p><em>Dis.</em> “Thanks to your goodness; nevertheless that admonition
of the apostle terrifies me: ‘God hath chosen the foolish of this
world to confound the wise.’”</p>

<p><em>Paph.</em> “Foolish and wise will alike be confounded before God, if
they do what is evil.”</p>

<p><em>Dis.</em> “That cannot be denied.”</p>

<p><em>Paph.</em> “How, I pray you, can the arts and sciences be better
employed than in the praise of Him who has created all things that
we can know, and who furnishes us at once both with the matter
and the instruments of our knowledge?”</p>

<p><em>Dis.</em> “Certainly, that is the best way to use science.”</p>

<p><em>Paph.</em> “It is; for the more we know of the admirable laws by
which God regulates the weight, number, and proportion of all things,
the more our hearts will burn with love of Him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>Where shall we find more admirable teaching than this on the
vexed question of the danger of intellectual pursuits? Dangerous
only, as Hroswitha justly argues, when we cease to refer them to
Him, who, as she so beautifully expresses it, “furnishes us at once
with the matter and the instruments of our knowledge;” but good,
holy, and greatly to be desired, when, by supplying us with a more
perfect knowledge of Him, they fill our hearts with His love. That
this was her own case, we may gather from the modest preface
which heads her first collection of poems.</p>

<p>“Here,” she says, “is a little book, simple in style, though it has
cost the writer no small trouble and application. I offer it to the
criticism of those kind judges who are disposed rather to put an
author right than to find fault with him. For I willingly acknowledge
that it contains many errors as well against the rules of composition
as those of prosody; but methinks one who frankly confesses
her defects, merits to meet with a ready pardon and a friendly
correction. If it be thought amiss that I have taken some of
my subjects from books, considered by some to be apocryphal,
I must explain that this is not the result of presumption but of
ignorance, for when I began my work I was not aware that they were
held as of doubtful authority. As soon as I learned that this was
the case, I ceased to use them. For the rest I claim indulgence, in
proportion as I feel a want of confidence in myself. Deprived of
most resources of study, and still young, I have been forced to
work in my rustic solitude far from the help of the learned. It has
been alone and unaided that I have produced my little work, by
dint of repeated compositions and corrections. The main substance
I have gathered from the Holy Scriptures, which were taught me in
this convent of Gandersheim, first by the wise and blessed mistress,
Richardis, and the religious who succeeded her in her office: and
then by the excellent Gerberga, of royal birth, under whose government
I am now living. Younger than me in years, but older in
knowledge, she deigned to form my mind by the reading of good
authors, in which she had also been instructed by learned mistresses.
Although the art of making verses is difficult, specially for a woman,
I have ventured, trusting in the Divine aid, to treat the subjects of
this book in heroic verse. My only object in this labour has been
to prevent the feeble talent committed to my keeping from growing
rusty. And I desired by the hammer of devotion to compel it to
give forth some sweet sounds to the praise of God. Wherefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
dear reader, if thou thinkest according to God, thou wilt know how
to supply what is wanting in this book; and if thou findest anything
good in it, refer it to God only, and attribute nothing to me but the
faults; without, however, reproaching me for them too severely, but
excusing them with that indulgence which a frank avowal deserves.”</p>

<p>Hroswitha’s humility had to stand the test of flattery from the
literary world, and it stood it well. There are phrases scattered
through her writings which evince how accurately she had gauged
the shallowness of intellectual vanity, and how little hold it had upon
her heart. “Often enough when curiosity is satisfied,” she writes,
“we find nothing but sadness.” In the epistle prefixed to her prose
dramas, she acknowledges the approbation which she has received
from the learned with an unaffected simplicity. “I cannot sufficiently
wonder,” she says, “that you who are so well versed in
philosophy should judge the humble work of a simple woman worthy
of your commendation. But when in your charity you congratulate
me, it is the Dispenser of that grace which works in me that you
praise, believing as you do that the little knowledge I possess is
superior to the weakness of my sex. Hitherto, I have hardly ventured
to show my rustic little productions to any one, but reassured
by your opinion, I shall now feel more confidence in writing, if God
give me the power. Yet I feel myself drawn by the two opposite
sentiments of joy and fear. I rejoice from my heart to see God and
His grace praised in me, but I fear lest men should think me greater
than I am. I do not mean to deny that, aided by Divine grace, I
have attained to a certain knowledge of the arts, for I am a creature
capable of instruction as others are; but I confess that left to my
own strength I should know nothing.”</p>

<p>These extracts require no comment. They prove something more
than the solid nature of the studies pursued in the convent school
of Gandersheim. How skilfully had the teachers of Hroswitha
contrived, whilst directing her intellectual labours, to preserve her
womanly modesty, her almost childish naïveté, and her deep religious
humility! Better things were included in their scheme of
education than a mere knowledge of the liberal arts; the wisdom
“whose beginning is the desire of discipline,” and into which “no
defiled thing cometh.” Under their training the genius of the young
poetess was guarded by the cloak of humility from the cunning moth
of pride; and whilst we are amazed at her learned attainments, her
modesty and candour at the same time conquer our hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>And with this agreeable picture we will close our present chapter,
trusting that the nun of Gandersheim may be allowed to have shed
something of beauty and fragrance over the rugged annals of the
Iron Age.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the close of the tenth century we may be said to have taken
our last farewell of the Dark Ages. Already on the horizon we
have seen the dawn of a period of greater intellectual light, which
ere long is to usher in the blaze of a splendid era. And yet it must
be owned, it is with something of regret that we take our leave of
those remote centuries, and with the wish of the poet in our hearts
that “their good darkness were our light.” The approaching sunrise
puts out the quiet stars; and in the bustle of intellectual life
into which we are about to enter, our heart misgives us lest something
of the charm which has hitherto hung round the history of the
Christian Schools may perchance be lost. Already a new element
has appeared in our studies, more easily felt than described. The
career of Gerbert, however brilliant, does not leave on the mind the
same impression as that of Bede; we feel a predominance of the
scholastic, over the religious character; and we think of him less
as a monk than as a mathematician. This element will now be far
more frequently met with, and what is worse, it will in many cases
be found accompanied by the ugly shapes of pride, love of novelty,
and self-interest, too often finding their final result in heresy and
open unbelief. The design of these pages is not to paint a series
of fancy pictures, but to study past ages so as to establish in our
mind a true standard of Christian Scholarship; to distinguish the
precious from the vile, the false lights of the intellect from those
kindled at the altar fire; and it will therefore be necessary to put
forth some of these unhappy examples in a broad and honest daylight,
that we may better see what those principles are, the forgetfulness
of which renders intellectual culture dangerous to faith.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have heard but little of the perils of the intellect.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
Learning, in the eyes of the old monastics, was the twin sister of
prayer. They would almost as soon have thought of apprehending
danger in their Psalter as in their grammar, and indeed the end for
which they used them both was substantially the same. Among
the characters named in the foregoing pages, how few appear disfigured
with the stains of vanity or self-interest! Scotus Erigena
indeed, is a notable example of the self-sufficient rationalist, and
Otheric of Magdeburg is said to have died of disappointment at
not obtaining a bishopric; but such instances are rare exceptions;
and though others doubtless existed, they do not appear on the
surface of history, and give no character to the scholastic profession.
As a class, the pedagogues of the Dark Ages were the most disinterested
of men. Poverty was recognised, not as the accident of a
student’s life, but as one of its most honourable features, and it was
reckoned as something monstrous and disgraceful for a man to sell
his learning for gold. This, of course, arose from the religious light
in which learned pursuits were regarded; they were spiritual wares,
the sale of which was held almost as simoniacal as the sale of a
benefice. If instances occasionally occur of any such sordid practices,
they are named by historians with a kind of horror; and
Launoy quotes the reproof addressed by the abbot Baldric to a
certain scholar of Angers, who had gone over to England to teach
grammar for the sake of “cursed gold,” and whose sudden death
was believed by his acquaintances to have been sent in just punishment
of his sin. This tradition survived, in theory at least, for
many centuries, and in 1362 the Professors of Paris University are
found pleading their inability to pay the expenses of a lawsuit then
pending, “it being their profession as scholars to have no wealth.”
In Spain there was a proverb which described a scholar as rich in
letters, and ragged in everything else, and Chaucer only produced
the current type of a student when he represented his Clerk of
Oxenford as “full hollow and threadbare.”</p>

<p>Now, however, a change passes over the picture; scholasticism is
about to appear less as a vocation than as a profession, and a profession
sought with the view of earning for him who embraces it,
honour at least, and perhaps also the more solid advantages of
worldly fortune and rich preferment. Some writers have supposed
that the promotion of Gerbert to the Papal dignity was one cause
of this change, leading others to hope that a brilliant scholastic
career might chance to prove the high road to wealth and dignities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Rohrbacher recognises in the rising spirit of the age distinct traces
of an infernal agency. “Hitherto,” he says, “heresy had made no
great progress in the West. But in the eleventh century the Spirit
of Darkness, seeing its empire confirmed in the East by the great
apostacy of Mahomet and the formal schism of the Greeks, seems
to have transferred the war from the East to the West. From that
epoch down to our own time, the great revolt against God and
His Church has never ceased to appear in one form or another.
Its two principal sources have been Pride and Luxury, the corruption
of the intellect, and the corruption of the heart. Hence, in
princes, the attempt to usurp authority over the Church: hence,
among men of learning, the mania for innovation, together with that
superficial vanity which urged Berengarius to his fall; which Luther
and Calvin erected into a principle under the name of Reform, and
to which Voltaire and Rousseau put the key-stone under the title
of Philosophy.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Fleury also supports this view, and speaking of
the swarm of heresies that sprang up suddenly in the eleventh century,
sees in the fact a fulfilment of the prophecy in the Apocalypse
that Satan should be loosed after being bound for a thousand years.
The whole of Christendom was possessed at the time with a vague
foreboding that an era had opened big with melancholy change,
and this presentiment of evil naturally enough took the shape
among the vulgar, of the belief that the world was about to come
to an end.</p>

<p>It is at this precise epoch that we first begin to meet with teachers
who were neither monks nor clerics. Free from the restraints of
cloisteral discipline, these new scholastics were professors of grammar
and rhetoric, and they were nothing more. The saintly rule of a
Benedict or a Columbanus had not moulded them to habits of
humility and obedience; they taught, and they made profit by their
teaching; and he who taught the most attractive novelty drew most
pupils, and made his teaching answer the best. It was a question
in which worldly lucre, rather than the interests of souls, was at
stake, and to be successful it became necessary for the teacher to
adapt himself to the tastes and humours of his audience. Hence
arose a race of pedants who had nothing in common with the elder
scholastics, and who bore a peculiar stamp of self-sufficiency and
arrogance, which impresses them all with a sort of family likeness,
and carries back one’s thoughts to the sophists of the pagan schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>The first notice which we find of a scholastic who was neither
monk nor canon, occurs about the year 1024, when Rodolphus
Glaber, a monk of Cluny, mentions in his chronicle a certain Witgard,
a grammarian by profession, who was so bewitched by the
study of the Latin poets, that he fancied he beheld in a vision
Virgil, Horace, and Juvenal, who thanked him for the affection he
bore them, and promised him immortality. The poor man’s head
was so turned with this idea, that he immediately began to teach
that whatever was contained in the poets, was to be believed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de fide</i>,
and strange to say, not a few were found to listen to him. He was
cited before the archbishop of Ravenna, and put to silence, after
creating a good deal of disturbance. I merely name him here as
an indication of the new class of men into whose hands the work of
teaching was beginning to fall; a far more important illustration of
the subject is to be found in the history of Berengarius. Before
speaking of him, however, something must be said of his master,
Fulbert, the pupil of Gerbert, and the restorer of the cathedral
school of Chartres. Though reckoned among French worthies, he
seems to have been a Roman by birth, and received his early education
in a very humble school. However, he afterwards studied
under Gerbert, and under his direction the school of Chartres rose
to such an eminence, that it rivalled that of Rheims, and Fulbert
may be said to have become preceptor to almost every man of
letters who distinguished himself in France during the eleventh
century.</p>

<p>We gather from the catalogue of the Chartres library, that Fulbert
had inherited no inconsiderable portion of his master Gerbert’s
scientific tastes. We find in it treatises on the properties of the
sphere and the globe, on the astrolabe, on the measurement of
superficies, and on land measurement, together with a Greek and
Arabic alphabet. Fulbert himself had the rare accomplishment of
Hebrew learning, as may be seen by his “Treatise against the
Jews.” His disciples went forth from his school to restore sacred
studies all over France, and the honour of being a pupil of him
whom they lovingly termed “Father Fulbert,” was claimed by a
long list of excellent masters, every one of whom might be described
in the terms with which Adelman has sketched the character of
Rainald of Tours; as “ready with the tongue, fluent with the pen,
and mighty in grammar.” “As to thee, Father Fulbert,” he
exclaims, “when I attempt to speak of thee, my words fail, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
heart melts, my eyes break forth into weeping.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Fulbert was, in
fact, worthy of any praise that could be bestowed on him, and so
thoroughly convinced of the sacredness of the office of teaching,
that even after he became Bishop of Chartres in 1016, he continued
to direct the studies of his episcopal school. He was regarded as
the prelate of his time most thoroughly versed in ecclesiastical discipline,
which he caused to be exactly practised. As a writer, he
is best known by his letters, which display a wonderful delicacy of
thought. He was knit in bonds of close friendship with St. Odilon
of Cluny, to whom he confided his fears, lest he might not have
been truly called to fill an office, the solemn responsibilities of which
almost overwhelmed him. “Yet,” he adds, “remembering my own
nothingness, and that without birth or fortune I have been raised to
this chair like a beggar from the dunghill, I am forced to believe it is
the will of God.”</p>

<p>A teacher of this temper was sure to have it at heart to impress
on the souls of his disciples a love of humility. It was the favourite
virtue of this truly great man, who was perfectly aware that the
elevation of Gerbert to the pontifical dignity had given rise to a
sentiment of ambition among men of letters, from which he boded
evil. He was therefore earnest in warning his pupils to avoid
novelties and to walk in the old footpaths; and his keen sagacious
eye rested with uneasiness on one young face among the scholars
who were accustomed to gather round him in his little garden and
listen to his affectionate exhortations, as children hang on the
words of a venerated parent. Berengarius, for it was he, had begun
his studies in the school of St. Martin of Tours, whence he passed
to Chartres, in company with his friend Adelman. He had a
brilliant rather than a solid genius, a ready tongue which made the
most of what he knew, but withal a certain affectation in speech
and manner which betrayed a fund of secret vanity. Fulbert knew
him well, and often spoke to him even with tears, conjuring him
never to forsake the beaten track, but to hold fast to the traditions
of the fathers. In 1028 the good bishop, then lying on his death-bed,
called all his disciples around him to bid them farewell, but
seeing Berengarius among the rest, he motioned for him to withdraw,
for, he said, “I see a dragon by his side.”</p>

<p>His prognostics were too soon fulfilled. Berengarius returned to
Tours, where his reputation for scholarship induced the canons to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
commit their school to his management; and even after he was
appointed archdeacon of Angers, he continued to lecture at Tours,
earning the reputation of immense learning, eloquence, and skill in
grammar and philosophy. All, however, were not equally pleased
with the character of his teaching, and some hesitated not bluntly to
avow their belief that the brilliant archdeacon was somewhat shallow,
and that his philosophy verged on sophistry. He had a way of
mystifying the simplest subjects by a display of learned words;
affected new and startling definitions, and had some tricks for practising
on the minds of his audience, which gave offence to many.
He chose that his chair should be raised higher than the others, had
a pompous way of walking, spoke in a slow and particularly plaintive
tone of voice, and would sit with his head wrapped up in his mantle,
like an ancient philosopher, absorbed, as it seemed, in some very
profound meditation. In short, he was one of those who aim at
what Bacon calls “being wise by signs;” did trifles in a solemn way,
and so imposed on the simpler sort who thought him a prodigy; a
sentiment in which, it is needless to say, he himself fully concurred.</p>

<p>Let us leave this pompous personage for a while to enjoy the
admiration of his numerous disciples, whilst we cast our eyes on the
schools of law which were just then springing up at Bologna, where
a young student of Pavia, Lanfranc by name, was distinguishing
himself by his skill as a writer and an advocate. On leaving Bologna,
he is thought to have taught jurisprudence for some time in his native
city, and then crossing the Alps, he came into France, bringing with
him no other riches than his learned reputation. Arriving at Tours,
his name reached the ears of Berengarius, who at once sought him
out and challenged him to a public disputation. The end aimed at
was evidently the glorification of the archdeacon, who counted on an
easy victory over the young stranger, which might help to swell his
reputation. Never were expectations more completely disappointed.
Berengarius was worsted in his arguments, and obliged to retire with
ruffled feathers; far from increasing his renown, he had suffered a
severe defeat, and in the eyes of wounded vanity, defeat is the
bitterest of mortifications. His followers were astonished to find
their master was not infallible, and began to transfer their admiration
to his successful rival. Lanfranc, meanwhile, proceeded to Avranches,
where he opened a school which was soon thronged by deserters
from that of Berengarius. It was a crisis in his life, for his character
was one which was as likely as not to have yielded to the perils that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
surrounded him. If free from the vanity which devoured his rival,
his proud and impetuous temper was at that time quite as little
under the restraint of religious principle; his devotion to science
was perhaps more thoroughly the genuine enthusiasm of a scholar
who loved learning for its own sake, rather than for the meed of
human applause, but it was as yet wholly unsanctified by a higher
and diviner intention. Nevertheless, there was a candour and
uprightness of soul about him which the other did not possess, and
when the call of grace sounded in his ear, he responded to it with
noble generosity.</p>

<p>One day as he was journeying from Avranches to Rouen, he had
to pass through a forest, where he was attacked by robbers, who having
stripped him of all he possessed, tied him to a tree, wrapped his
hood about his head so as to muffle his cries for help, and then
abandoned him. Left thus during the entire night exposed to danger
of death from the wolves, or the more lingering tortures of starvation,
Lanfranc in his extremity bethought him of his prayers, but the
learned advocate and philosopher found himself unable to call to his
remembrance the simplest form of devotion. That one fact spoke
volumes to his conscience; during the long hours of that terrible
night he had time bitterly to mourn over the years lost in pursuits,
the vanity of which he had never known till now; and ere morning
dawned he solemnly vowed, if God should deliver him from his
danger, to dedicate the remainder of his life to the task of reparation.</p>

<p>At break of day some passing travellers discovered and unbound
him, and Lanfranc’s first request was to be led to the nearest
monastery. There was by this time no want of religious houses in
the duchy of Normandy. The century that had elapsed since the
conversion of Duke Rollo, had witnessed a very general restoration
of the monastic institute in that province, and many of the great
abbeys, such as Jumièges, St. Wandrille, Fécamp, and Bernai, had
risen from their ashes, with even greater splendour than they had
exhibited before their destruction. But it was to none of these that
the good Providence of God guided the steps of Lanfranc. In the
year 1039 the little house of Bec had been founded by a pious
Norman knight named Herluin, who himself became the first abbot.
Nothing could be ruder or simpler than the commencements of this
famous abbey. Herluin was poor and unlettered, he and his monks
had to live hardly by the labour of their hands, their ordinary food
was bread made with bran, and vegetables, with muddy water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
brought from a well two miles off. At the very moment when Lanfranc
presented himself, the abbot was superintending the construction
of an oven, and was kneading the bread with somewhat dirty
hands, for he had come fresh from the labour of the field. At
another time the sight would have disgusted the refined and fastidious
Lombard, but at that moment his heart felt an appetite for
abasement, and he promptly offered himself, and was received as
one of the little community.</p>

<p>He was subjected to a severe noviciate. For three years, it is
said, he kept a rigorous silence, and was tested by every kind of
humiliation. Once, when reading aloud in the refectory, the prior
corrected his Latin accent, and desired him to pronounce the <em>e</em> in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docere</i> short. This was probably a hard trial to the humility of the
Bolognese professor, who must have regarded his Norman companions
as little better than barbarians; but Lanfranc complied
without hesitation, judging, says his biographer, that an act of disobedience
was a greater evil than a false quantity in Latin. After
he had passed through his probation, the abbot, who had learnt to
value both his learning and his sincere humility, finding him unfit
for manual labour, desired him to begin to teach, and thus were
founded the famous schools of Bec. Their renown soon eclipsed
that of every other existing academy. “Before that time,” says
Odericus, “in the reigns of six dukes of Normandy, scarce any
Norman applied himself to regular studies, nor had any doctor arisen
among them till, by the Providence of God, Lanfranc appeared in
their province.” But now a new era was inaugurated. Priests and
monks came to Bec in multitudes, in order to place themselves
under a master who was pronounced the best Latinist, the best
theologian, and the best dialectician of his time; there were never
fewer than a hundred pupils; the Norman nobles, and even the
Dukes themselves, sent their sons thither for education, and made
enormous grants of land to the favoured abbey.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the fame of this new academy was
long in reaching the ears of Berengarius, whose chagrin at finding
his own renown eclipsed by his former rival was hard to endure.
Up to that time he had addicted himself exclusively to dialectics,
and had given very little study to the Scriptures, a circumstance
sufficiently illustrative of the wide chasm which separated the rising
school of teachers from that which immediately preceded them.
But now, to support his failing credit, Berengarius began to lecture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
on a subject he had never studied, and to explain the Scriptures,
not according to the traditions of the Fathers, but after the whims
of his own imagination. His first errors were on questions connected
with marriage and infant baptism, but it was not long before
he broached his grand heresy, and attacked the Catholic doctrine of
the Real Presence in the Most Holy Eucharist, reviving all the
arguments and sophistries of Scotus Erigena. The scandal spread
from Tours through France and Germany. His old friend Adelman,
at that time scholasticus of Liège, heard the news and wrote to him
in moving terms, conjuring him to retract his fatal errors. “I have
been wont to call you my foster brother,” he says, “calling to mind
the happy days we passed together at the school of Chartres (though
you were younger than I), under that venerable Socrates, Fulbert.
Remember the conversation he used to hold with us in his garden
near the chapel, how tenderly he used to speak to us, his voice
sometimes choked with tears, conjuring us not to depart from the
old paths, but to keep firm to the traditions of the Fathers. And
now they tell me that you have separated from the unity of the
Church, teaching that what we daily offer on the altar is not the true
body and blood of Jesus Christ, but only a figure! God help you,
my brother! let me implore you by the mercy of God, and the
memory of the Blessed Fulbert, not thus to trouble the peace of our
Holy Mother the Church, for whose faith so many millions of
doctors and martyrs have constantly contended.”</p>

<p>Adelman’s entreaties produced no effect on him to whom they
were addressed, and a controversy began in which Lanfranc took a
distinguished part, assisting at the councils of Rheims, Rome and
Vercelli. In all these Berengarius was successively condemned, and
required to abjure his errors. But he obeyed with the lips only.
As he continued to propagate his heresies in spite of repeated abjurations,
Pope Victor II., in 1054, summoned two other Councils, at
Florence and Tours, at the last of which Berengarius signed a
solemn retractation with his own hand. But so soon as he left the
presence of the assembled fathers, he set himself secretly to disseminate
his former doctrines. At a second Council held at Tours,
attended by 113 bishops, he again appeared, signed a profession of
Catholic doctrine, and threw all his own writings into the fire, and
the same farce was repeated at three other Councils, followed by
the same result. It was not until 1079 that Lanfranc, then Archbishop
of Canterbury, published his famous treatise “On the Body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
of Our Lord,” and about the same time his scholar Guitmond, afterwards
Bishop of Aversa, wrote an equally celebrated treatise, bearing
the same title, in which he traces the errors of Berengarius to the
fatal root of vanity. “Even when a youth at school,” he says,
“according to the account of those who then knew him, he made
little account of the teaching of his master, held as nothing the
opinions of his companions, and despised the books on liberal arts.
He could not himself attain to the profounder parts of philosophy,
for he was not of a very penetrating mind, and therefore tried to
gain a learned reputation by new and unheard-of verbal definitions.”
There is something mournfully significant in this account, and the
grievous termination of a career, the very dawn of which was marked
by such prognostics, makes the character and history of Berengarius
one which scholars of all ages would do well to set before them as a
warning beacon. The writings of Lanfranc and Guitmond seem at
last to have opened his eyes to the truth; at any rate from that time
he kept silence, and is said to have spent the remaining eight years
of his life in retirement and sincere penitence. William of Malmsbury
says that his dying words betrayed his consciousness of the
irreparable evils he had inflicted on the Church, and the terror with
which he was filled at the thought of the souls whom he might have
ruined. “This day will my Lord Jesus Christ appear to call me,
either to glory, by His mercy, on my repentance, or, as I fear, on
account of the loss of other souls, to my punishment.” Yet his
followers were neither numerous nor of any weight or character. We
find in the letter written by Gozechinus of Liège to a brother scholastic,
that every one of the great masters of the time, such as those
who presided over the schools of Rheims, Paris, Spires, and Bamberg
joined heart and soul with Lanfranc in condemning his doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Malmsbury says he had in all but three hundred disciples, while on
the other hand the united voice of Christendom, and especially
of the monastic order, was raised against him, and never was any
heresy more universally condemned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the schools of Bec grew and prospered, and the convent
was soon found too small to contain its scholars. There were
gathered together students of all ranks and conditions, “profound
sophists,” as Oderic Vitalis calls them, and a long list of ecclesiastics
destined to become the shining lights of the Church. Among these
were Ivo of Chartres, Fulk of Beauvais, Gundulph, afterwards bishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
of Rochester, Anselm de Bagio, afterwards Pope Alexander II., and
a great number of the Anglo-Norman abbots. Alexander II., in
after years, gave a memorable sign of the respect with which he
regarded his old preceptor. When Lanfranc visited Rome as Archbishop
of Canterbury, and was introduced into the presence of the
Pontiff, the latter, contrary to the usual custom, rose, and advanced
to meet him. “I show this mark of respect,” he said, turning to the
surrounding prelates, “not to the archbishop, but to the man at
whose feet I sat as a disciple in the schools of Bec.” Besides these
there was Guitmond, already named, the courageous monk, who,
entreated by the Conqueror to accept high ecclesiastical promotion
in England, not only refused the offer, but accompanied his refusal
with a letter of reproof which probably spoke plainer truths to
William of Normandy than he had ever before had an opportunity
of hearing. Oderic calls him devout and deeply learned, and in his
book on the Sacrament of the Altar, the good monk recalls with
affection the teaching he had received at Bec, which he styles “that
great and famous school of literature.” But by far the greatest
disciple of this school was a countryman of Lanfranc’s, destined to
surpass him in renown both as a saint and a doctor. Anselm, a
native of Aosta, in Lombardy, abandoning his native land, had after
three years of study in Burgundy, established himself at Avranches,
where he seems to have taught for some time in the school formerly
directed by Lanfranc. But in 1059, being then but twenty-five years
of age, he found his way to Bec, and soon distinguished himself as
the first of all the noble crowd of scholars. For a while he continued
there, studying and teaching by turns, but erelong the desire of
religious perfection mastered that of intellectual progress. He
resolved to take the monastic habit, but was unable to determine
whether it should be at Cluny or at Bec. At Cluny indeed his vast
acquirements would be of small profit; at Bec the superiority of
Lanfranc would, he believed, almost equally eclipse him. But what
of that? it was eclipse and nothingness that he was in search of,
rather than fame and distinction. He opened his heart to his
master, who, reluctant to decide a point in which his own feelings
would naturally colour his advice, referred him to Maurillus, Archbishop
of Rouen, and the result was that Anselm remained at Bec.
His profession took place in 1060, and three years later Lanfranc,
being appointed by Duke William abbot of his newly-founded
monastery of St. Stephen at Caen, Anselm succeeded him in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
office of prior. Some of the monks murmured at this appointment,
but he overcame their ill-will by the sweetness of his charity. One
young monk, named Osbern, who had shown the greatest opposition
to the new prior, became at last his favourite disciple, won over by
the patient long-suffering of a master who showed him a mother’s
tenderness, mingled with a father’s care. At first he gained his
good-will by encouraging his talents, overlooking his childish sallies
of temper, and granting him many favours; but when his confidence
was secured he accustomed him to severer discipline, and showed
his satisfaction at his pupil’s progress by requiring him to accept
very humiliating penances. He trusted to have found in this youth
one destined to achieve great things for God, but Osbern was carried
off by a sudden sickness, and left none to replace him in the affections
of the prior.</p>

<p>Anselm’s life at Bec was one of continual labour. Whilst directing
the studies of his pupils he did not neglect his own. His deeply
philosophic mind was one of those which is incapable of desisting
from a course of reasoning on any subject which it has once grasped,
till the final solution is reached. His genius possessed a certain
metaphysical subtlety, which engaged him in speculative questions,
to resolve which he gave up, not merely whole days, but whole nights
also. His studies were accompanied with rigorous austerities, which
were, however, very far from diminishing that sweetness of disposition
which rendered him dear to God and man. To his other
labours were added those entailed on him as librarian to the
monastery. Lanfranc had commenced the formation of the library,
and his work was carried on by his successor with unwearied zeal.
The Bec library was afterwards enlarged by the donations of Philip
of Harcourt, Bishop of Bayeux, and besides a rich collection of the
Fathers and the Latin classics, contained the Institutes of Quinctilian
and the Hortensius of Cicero, of which latter work no copy is now
known to exist. The great destruction of books which had taken
place during the barbaric invasions rendered them now both rare and
costly. Superiors of the different religious houses were therefore
glad to establish friendly relations one with another, and to make
agreements by which each supplied what they possessed, and what
was wanting to the others. “We are ready to give you a pledge of
our affection,” writes Durandus, abbot of La Chaise Dieu, to St.
Anselm, “and in return we will ask one of you. Choose what you
will that we possess; as to us, our choice is the Epistles of St. Paul.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
Anselm was not content with collecting books; he spared no pains
to correct them, and spent a good part of his nights in this employment.
The multifarious duties which fell on him devoured so large
a portion of his day that he could only supply the requisite time for
his literary labours by defrauding himself of sleep; and he would
have resigned his office in order more exclusively to give himself up
to meditation and study had he not been withheld by the prohibition
of Maurillus.</p>

<p>The subject which most frequently engaged his thoughts was the
Being and Attributes of God. The first work which he wrote was
his <cite>Monologion</cite>, in which he endeavoured to state the metaphysical
arguments by which the existence of God might be proved even
according to mere natural reason. The work was written at the
request of some of the monks, but before publishing it he sent it to
Lanfranc, desiring him to correct, and even to suppress, whatever he
judged proper. After producing some other philosophical treatises,
the thought occurred to him to try and discover whether it were
possible, by following any single course of reasoning, to prove that
which in his <cite>Monologion</cite> he had supported by a variety of arguments.
The idea took possession of his mind: sometimes he thought he had
found what he was seeking for, and then again it escaped him. So
utterly was he absorbed by the subject that he lost sleep and appetite,
and even his attention at the Divine Office became distracted.
Dreading lest it should be some dark temptation, he tried to banish
the whole matter from his mind, but it was in vain; the more he
fled from his own thoughts the more constantly did they pursue him.
At last one night every link in the chain being complete, he seized
some waxen tablets and wrote the argument as it stood clear and
distinct in his mind. A copy was made on parchment by his monks,
and this new work formed his <cite>Proslogion</cite>, which, at the desire of the
legate Hugh, Archbishop of Lyons, was published with his name
attached. The argument of this celebrated book is thus analysed
by M. Rémusat, in his life of the saint. “He who believes in God
believes that there is Something so great that a greater cannot be
conceived. Does such a nature really exist? The infidel who
denies it nevertheless understands what is meant by the idea, and
this idea exists in his understanding, if it exist nowhere else. The
mere idea of an object does not necessarily imply the belief in its
existence. A painter has an <em>idea</em> of a picture which he knows does
not as yet exist. But this Something which is better and greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
than anything of which we can conceive cannot exist merely in our
minds; for if it did exist only in our minds, we should be able to
imagine it as existing in reality, that is to say, we should be able to
conceive of it as being yet greater, a thing which according to our
original supposition was not to be allowed as possible. Therefore,
that which is so great that nothing can be greater must exist, not
only in the mind, but in fact. Were the Being which is supposed
to be above all that can be imagined, to be regarded as having no
real existence, He would no longer be greater than we could conceive.
To make Him so, He must have existence. The contradiction
is evident. There is then really and truly a Being above Whom
nothing can be conceived, and Who therefore cannot be thought of
as though it were possible that He should not exist. And this
Being, it is Thou, O my God! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et hoc es tu, Domine Deus noster!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
Many were found both in his own and later times who took alarm at
reasoning so bold and original, but Anselm defended his arguments
in an Apology, which established his fame as the greatest metaphysician
who had appeared in the Latin Church since the days of
St. Augustine.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>As we are here engaged rather with the history of schools than with
that of literature, this passing glance at St. Anselm’s studies will
suffice to indicate the new direction which the awakening intellect
of Europe was about to follow. Hitherto ecclesiastical writers had
for the most part been content to gather up and reproduce the
traditionary wisdom of the Fathers; but now, when those traditions
had become firmly established, a scientific superstructure was to be
raised on that broad foundation, and the theology of the Church was
to be built up into a compact and well-ordered system. This was
the work of the scholastic theologians, of whom St. Anselm may be
considered as the first.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to trace in the system of education followed by so
profound a thinker, the same paternal sweetness which characterised
the older monastic teachers. Intellectual depth is often enough
deficient in tenderness, and it would scarcely have been matter of
surprise had we found the metaphysical mind of Anselm incapable
of adapting itself to the simplicity and waywardness of childhood.
But the problems, which intellect alone is powerless to resolve, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
quickly unlocked by the key of charity. Anselm would have been
no saint had not his heart been far larger than his intellect; and his
heart it was that communicated to him those three graces which one
of our own poets has so beautifully described as bearing up the
little world of education&mdash;Love, Hope, and Patience.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> One day he
was visited by the abbot of a neighbouring monastery, who came to
consult him on the proper manner of bringing up the children committed
to his care. Those whom he had hitherto trained were, he
said, most perverse and incorrigible. “We do our best to correct
them,” he added; “we beat them from morning till night, but I
own I can see no improvement.” “And how do they grow up?”
inquired Anselm. “Just as dull and stupid as so many beasts,” was
the reply. “A famous system of education truly,” observed the abbot
of Bec, “which changes men into beasts. Now tell me, what would
be the result, if, after having planted a tree in your garden you were
to compress it so tightly that it should have no room to extend its
branches? These poor children were given to you that you might
help them to grow, and be fruitful in good thoughts; but if you
allow them no liberty their minds will grow crooked. Finding no
kindness on your part, they will give you no confidence, and never
having been brought up to know the meaning of love and charity,
they will see everything around them in a distorted aspect. You
beat them, you tell me? But is a beautiful statue of gold or silver
formed only by blows? The weak must be treated with gentleness,
and won with love; you must invite a soul to virtue with cheerfulness,
and charitably bear with its defects.” He then explained his own
method of education, till at last the other cast himself at his feet,
owning his imprudence, and promising in future to abandon his
excessive severity.</p>

<p>The names of Lanfranc and St. Anselm have, of course, a special
interest to English readers, although it is rather as abbots of Bec
than as Archbishops of Canterbury that they find a place in these
pages. The Norman Conquest, which placed Lanfranc on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
episcopal throne of St. Augustine, must, however, be regarded as an
important era in the scholastic history of England, from the total
revolution which it effected in the ecclesiastical administration of
that country. Whatever may be thought of the manner in which
the change was carried out, there can be little doubt that the substitution
of an Anglo-Norman for an Anglo-Saxon hierarchy was on the
whole beneficial to the cause both of religion and learning. Most of
the ecclesiastics promoted by William were men of high character,
and this was indeed one of the few consolatory thoughts which presented
themselves to his mind when he lay upon his bed of death.
His choice of Lanfranc for the primacy filled that prelate with dismay,
nor was it until Cardinal Hubert laid on him the commands of the
Apostolic See, that he could be induced to accept a charge so begirt
with difficulty. His letter to his old pupil Pope Alexander II.,
shortly after his arrival in England, expresses the distress of his mind,
at the hard heartedness, cupidity, and corruption which everywhere
met his eye, and which, together with the barbarism, as he deemed
it, of the inhabitants, and his total ignorance of their language, moved
him to implore that he might resign the onerous dignity. As, however,
this could not be permitted, he applied himself to the reform of
the church of Canterbury, and the restoration in it of the monastic
rule, which, since the martyrdom of St. Elphege, had fallen into utter
decay. In spite of the pressing difficulties of the times, he contrived
also to do something for the encouragement of letters, though far less
than he would have effected under more favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>The schools of Peterborough and Evesham are likewise noticed
as famous during the reign of the Confessor, who was himself a lover
of learning, and, among his other laws, decreed that the person of a
schoolmaster should be regarded as equally inviolable with that of a
clerk. Winchcombe, always devoted to letters, whose scholars had
been famous since the days of St. Kenelm, was still known as a
place of study, and kept up its reputation so late as the fifteenth
century. Old Ramsey, too, retained its celebrity, and scholars still
wandered under the trees planted by St. Ethelwold, and kept up the
arts which he had introduced into its scriptorium. In 1047 a certain
monk of St. Edmundsbury became abbot there, whose skill in all
gold and silver work was a sort of marvel. One of his monks,
named Oswald, refused a bishopric on the simple ground that he
could not tear himself from his books. “He chose rather,” says
the chronicler, “to cherish the placid cultivation of letters in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
bosom of his mother, the church of Ramsey. We have still in our
archives a certain versified book of his, bearing evidence of his
multifarious knowledge and perspicacious wit.” Nor must we forget
the holy Wulstan, the last of our Anglo-Saxon saints. He had been
educated in the minster school of Peterborough by the monk
Ervene, who coaxed him to learn his letters by choosing for his
lesson-book a fine Psalter, illuminated by his own hands. After he
became prior and scholasticus of Worcester, Wulstan devoted himself
to study with such ardour as often to spend two or three days
in reading without so much as breaking his fast. His long night-watches
seriously injured his health, and in the morning he was
often found in the church fast asleep, with his worn-out head resting
on the book he had been studying.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the love of letters was not quite
extinct in the cloisters of Saxon England; and the coming of
Lanfranc blew the embers into a flame. He set himself to restore
a great number of cathedral and monastic schools that had fallen
into decay, and during his leisure hours liked to hear some poor
scholars hold disputations in his presence on learned subjects,
rewarding them with liberal gifts.</p>

<p>But besides his encouragement of learned men, Lanfranc did
good service to the cause of letters in other ways. He often interposed
his kind offices to save the ancient English foundations from
the vengeance of the Conqueror. Thus, having succeeded in averting
the threatened destruction of St. Alban’s Abbey, which William
had doomed in consequence of the brave resistance he had met with
from its abbot, Frithric, Lanfranc conferred it on a relative and
pupil of his own named Paulinus, who has fallen under the lash
of Matthew Paris, but who nevertheless proved an excellent
abbot. He introduced the “Constitutions,” published by Lanfranc
for the government of the English Benedictines, reformed a host of
irregularities, and, with the help of subsidies liberally granted by the
archbishop, built several useful offices, and established the first
scriptorium attached to the abbey.</p>

<p>I know not what my readers will say when they hear that the
mill, the bakehouse, and the scriptorium erected by Paulinus were
all built out of the tiles and stones of the ancient Verulam, collected
by his Saxon predecessors Ealdred and Eadmer, who had made
some very curious excavations among the ruins of the Roman city,
and had laid open a palace with its baths and its atrium. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
they had dug up a number of books in good preservation, one
of which was in a tongue unknown to all, and proved at last to be
a British history of the “Acts of St. Alban.” The other books were
in Latin, and, relating to heathen worship, were committed to the
flames. This sounds barbarous to antiquarian ears, but there is
worse to tell. Eadmer ordered that all the altars, urns, coins, and
glass vessels discovered by the workmen should be destroyed. The
day had not yet come when relics of paganism were deemed safe or
fit objects for good Christians to collect in their museums, and the
Vatican collection itself would probably have fared but badly in the
hands of Alcuin or St. Boniface. However, the monks of St.
Alban’s, though destroyers of the Verulam antiquities, were very
active in setting up their scriptorium. Paulinus furnished it with
twenty-eight “notable volumes,” and many others were presented by
Lanfranc. There is, moreover, a distinct notice of the existence of
the abbey school. Abbot Richard, who succeeded Paulinus (after
the Red King had contrived to keep the abbacy vacant for five
years), showed a great interest in the success of this school, and
invited over from Maine a certain master named Geoffrey de
Gorham, to take on him its direction. Gorham however, was
rather dilatory, and by the time he arrived in England the office had
been given to another. So he removed to Dunstable, and there
read lectures for some time, and whilst so occupied, invented a
miracle-play, said to be the first that is noticed in history, the subject
being the martyrdom of St. Katherine. These sacred dramas were
used as means of popular instruction, and often contained a fine
vein of poetry. As time went on, and they fell out of the hands of
the ecclesiastics into those of a class of writers and actors whose
object it was to please, rather than to instruct the multitude, they
became debased by the introduction of coarse jests and buffoonery,
which abound in the specimens best known to English readers, but
of which there is not the slightest trace in the earlier religious dramas.
The dress and getting up of the pieces, in which there was a wonderful
amount of ingenuity displayed, and even of stage trickery,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> of course
enhanced their success; and Gorham borrowed from the sacristan
of St. Alban’s the choral copes of the abbey, to be used in the first
representation of his play. Unfortunately, the very next night his
house caught fire, and the borrowed copes, together with his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
books, were all destroyed. It was a great disaster; and in atonement
for his carelessness he assumed the monastic habit at St.
Alban’s; and this was the reason, says Matthew Paris, that when he
became abbot he was so careful to provide the choir with new rich
copes.</p>

<p>In the midst of his many cares and anxieties, Lanfranc found time
to devote to literary toils. They were useful ones, well worthy of a
monk and a bishop. He corrected the text of the entire Bible, and
of several of the Fathers. He never forgot Bec, and sent several
youths, and among others his own nephew and namesake, there for
education; and much of his correspondence with St. Anselm turns
on the progress of these young men in their studies. Anselm, on
his part, frankly confesses that he gets very weary of continually
teaching the younger boys their declensions; and lets us know that
he required his pupils to compose often in Latin, and rather in prose
than in verse; that he recommended them to read Virgil and the
other classics, and to be diligent in copying manuscripts. At other
times his letters, treating of literary subjects, and accompanying
presents of precious books to the Canterbury scriptorium, introduce
allusions to the health of his scholars, evincing that paternal tenderness
which was so remarkable a feature in his character.</p>

<p>Anselm, who had been elected abbot of Bec on the death of
Herluin, during his visits to England became personally known to
the Conqueror, whose furious passions were restrained in presence of
the gentle saint, who won both his love and his reverence. It was
whilst at Canterbury, on a visit to his friend Lanfranc, that the abbot
of Bec made his first acquaintance with his future biographer, the
young Saxon Eadmer. This was the time when he so sweetly
defended the memory of the Anglo-Saxon saints from the contempt
with which Lanfranc was disposed to regard them; and possibly
this circumstance may have had some share in securing him the
confidence and affection of Eadmer, who then held the office of
precentor in the cathedral of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Lanfranc died in 1089, having survived the great Conqueror
nearly two years. The events which, four years later, placed St.
Anselm on the archiepiscopal throne of Canterbury, and his heroic
struggles against the usurpations of the temporal power in the reigns
of William Rufus and Henry I., scarcely fall within our present
subject, though they form not the least important chapter in our
national Church history. But the succession to the primacy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
another great scholar was an event which made itself felt in the
world of letters, and kindled extraordinary ardour for learned pursuits
among the English clergy. This spirit was certainly encouraged
by the Norman kings, who, ferocious tyrants as they were, all
more or less exhibited a taste for letters. The Conqueror took
special care of the education of his children. Henry Beauclerk was
educated at Abingdon Abbey, under the care of Faricius, an Italian
monk of Malmsbury. The proficiency of the young prince as displayed
by his version of Æsop’s fables, is commonly said to have
earned him his learned sobriquet; but Mr. Wright, in his “Biographia
Britannica,” calls his authorship in question. Both his
sisters, and his two queens, Matilda of Scotland and Adeliza of
Louvaine, were patrons of letters. Some epistles from Matilda to
St. Anselm are preserved, which display no mean degree of scholarship,
if they were really the production of her own pen. The
encouragement of these two princesses quickened the imagination
of a host of versifiers, who began to <ins class="corr" id="tn319" title="Transcriber’s Note—“neglect the composition of haxameters” changed to “neglect the composition of hexameters”.">neglect the composition of hexameters</ins>
in limping Latin, and to substitute in their room songs
and romances in Norman-French. The Anglo-Saxon tongue was, of
course, never heard at court; and some writers, like William of
Malmsbury, went so far as to omit the Saxon names of men and
places, through an over-delicate fear of distressing refined organs by
such barbarous sounds. A new literature meanwhile sprang up, bearing
the impress of an age of knight-errantry. Alexander, Arthur, and
Charlemagne found themselves transformed from historic personages
into heroes of quaint and extravagant fictions, full of hippogrifs,
dragons, and enchanted castles, where distressed damsels were held
captive by wicked magicians, in order to be delivered by the prowess
of doughty knights&mdash;a style of composition to which we give a name
borrowed from the language used by the narrators, that, namely, of
the <em>Romance</em> dialect of France. Among the accumulation of
rubbish written in this dialect, which was about this time poured
forth into the world, one book of a higher character appears, the
production of Prior Guichard of Beaulieu. It is a sermon in verse
on the vices of the age, and appears to have been written to be
actually recited, for he begins by telling his hearers that he is going
to talk to them, not in Latin, but in the vernacular, that every one
may understand what he says. De la Rue, who notices this curious
poem, observes that the mention of a sermon in verse need not
cause surprise, as at that epoch it was a common thing for the Anglo-Norman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
clergy to read to the people on Sundays and holy-days the
lives of the saints in French verse. Nine such versified lives are
still preserved, the production of Boson, nephew to Pope Alexander
II. The mediæval preachers had sometimes recourse to strange
expedients in order to rouse the slumbering attention of their
hearers. Vincent of Beauvais tells us that in his time it was a
common thing to lighten a dull subject by introducing one of
Æsop’s fables, a practice which he does not absolutely condemn,
but recommends to be used sparingly.</p>

<p>Besides the disciples reared in our native schools, a large number
of English scholars were to be found, who mingled with the graver
pursuits of learning something of that spirit of knight-errantry and
wild adventure which characterised the times. Arabic Spain was
just then regarded as the fountain-head of science. The Moorish
sovereigns of Cordova had collected an immense library in their
capital, and are reported to have had seventy others in different parts
of their dominions. Thither, then, wandered many an English
student, attracted rather than repelled by the tales of glamour
associated with a Moslem land. One of these scholar adventurers
was Athelhard of Bath, the greatest man of science who appeared in
England before the time of Roger Bacon. In the reign of the Red
King he had left his own country to study at Tours and Laon, in
which latter place he opened a school. Thence he proceeded to
Salerno, Greece, Asia Minor, and Spain, increasing his stock of
learning, and returned at last, after a long absence, in the reign of
Henry I. After this he opened a school in Normandy, where he
taught the Arabic sciences, in spite of the prejudices which many
felt against learning acquired from so suspicious a source. Among
those who so objected was Athelhard’s own nephew; and in defence
of his favourite studies the English master wrote a book, in which
he reminds his nephew of an agreement formerly made between
them, that one should gather all the learning taught by the Arabs,
while the other should, in like manner, study the wisdom of the
Franks. This book is written in the form of a colloquy, in which
the nephew is made to appear as the champion of the old system
of education, and the uncle of the new.</p>

<p>I do not know whether we should conclude that Athelhard gained
very much from his Arabic masters; for if he studied at Cordova
the causes of earthquakes, eclipses, and tides, we find from his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæstiones</i> that he had also devoted a considerable portion of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
time to investigating the reason why plants cannot be produced in
fire, why the nose is made to hang over the mouth, why the human
forehead is not furnished with horns, whether the stars are animals,
whether on that hypothesis they have any appetite, with other
equally singular and puerile questions. In spite of these eccentricities,
however, Athelhard was a really learned man. He translated
Euclid and other mathematical works out of the Arabic, and is
styled by Vincent of Beauvais, “the Philosopher of England.” A
few years later we find another Englishman, named Robert de
Retines, studying at Evora in company with a certain Hermann of
Dalmatia, who is called a most acute and erudite scholar. Robert
had travelled in search of learning through France, Italy, Dalmatia,
Greece, and Asia Minor, and finally made his way into Spain, where
Peter of Cluny found the two friends studying astrology at Evora.
Peter’s journey into Spain was undertaken with the view of obtaining
more exact information as to the Mohammedan doctrines and
writings, and he induced the two scholars to give up their unprofitable
pursuits, and employ their knowledge of Arabic in translating
the Koran. This they did in 1143. Robert afterwards became
archdeacon of Pampeluna; he did not, however, entirely forsake
his own country, but returning thither, wrote a translation of the
Saxon Chronicle, which is preserved in the Bodleian library, and
which is dedicated to Peter of Cluny. His friend Hermann, who
is styled “a most acute and profound scholastic,” produced a translation
of Ptolemy’s “Planisphere,” which he addressed to his old
Spanish preceptor Theodoricus, and from the preface to this book
we find that the school at which they studied was not Arabic, but
Christian, a fact of some importance, as it is very generally stated
that the Spanish academies resorted to at this time by European
students were those of the Arabic masters, who are represented as
alone possessing any knowledge of the mathematical sciences. It
is clear however that now, as in the time of Gerbert, there existed
Christian schools in Spain, no less efficient than those of the Moors,
and that it was to these that many of the French and English
scholars resorted for the purposes of study.</p>

<p>To the names of these learned Englishmen I must add that of
Odericus Vitalis, the course of whose education is best given in his
own words in that short summary of his life with which he concludes
his history. “I was baptized,” he says, “at Attingham, a village
in England, which stands on the bank of the great river Severn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
There, by the ministry of Odericus the priest, Thou didst regenerate
me with water and the Holy Ghost. When I was five years old I
was sent to school at Shrewsbury, and offered Thee my services in
the lowest order of the clergy in the Church of SS. Peter and Paul.
While there, Siward, a priest of great eminence, instructed me for
five years in the letters of Carmenta Nicostrata,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and taught me
psalms and hymns, with other necessary learning. I was ten years
old when I crossed the British sea, and arrived in Normandy, an
exile, unknown to all, and knowing no one. But supported by Thy
goodness, I found the utmost kindness and attention from these
foreigners. I was professed a monk in the monastery of St.
Evroult, by the venerable abbot Mainier, in the eleventh year of
my age, and he gave me the name of Vitalis, in place of that which
I received in England, and which seemed barbarous to the ears of
the Normans. In this monastery, through Thy goodness, I have
lived fifty-six years, loved and honoured by my brethren far more
than I have deserved. Bearing the heat and burden of the day in
a strange land, I have laboured among Thy servants, and as Thou
art faithful, I fear not but I shall receive the penny which Thou
hast promised.”</p>

<p>He elsewhere tells us that his master in this abbey was John of
Rheims, a disciple of the famous school of that city, who was an
author of no mean fame, and composed a great number of works
both in prose and verse. It does not appear that he ever studied
in any other academy, but whatever learning he afterwards attained
must have been acquired within the walls of his own monastery,
and he could scarcely have found his way to a better school. In
the eleventh century there was no branch of learning which was not
cultivated among the monks of St. Evroult; music, medicine, poetry,
painting, and the mechanical arts, all found there able professors.
The history of Odericus leaves us in no doubt as to the extent of
his literary attainments. He quotes most of the ancient classical
writers, and many of the Fathers of the Church, and the intelligence
of his mind is displayed by the way in which he collected the
materials of his work. Nothing escaped his notice, and from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
lips of some wandering Crusader or passing pilgrim he gathered up
the tales and episodes with which he enlivened his pages, giving
them in many parts the lively colouring of a romance. One day a
monk of Winchester who stopped at the abbey for a few hours
chanced to show him a life of St. William, copies of which were then
rare in Normandy. Odericus, in raptures at the sight of the treasure,
longed to copy it, but the traveller was in haste, and the fingers of
Odericus were benumbed with cold, for it was the depth of winter.
However, the opportunity was not to be lost, and seizing his tablets
he with great difficulty took such notes from the manuscript as
enabled him afterwards, at his leisure, to compose a life of the
founder of St. Gellone. His “Ecclesiastical History of England
and Normandy,” which occupied twenty years in its compilation, is
the only work he has left to posterity.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice as to the state of letters in England and
Normandy in the time of Lanfranc and Anselm; the scholars who
arose after them were not unworthy to be the disciples of a school
founded by these two illustrious archbishops; and it will be seen
that the University of Paris, which was soon to efface by the splendour
of its fame that of every other lesser academy, owed its renown
in no small degree to the learning of its English professors.</p>

<p class="pfs90">THE RISE OF SCHOLASTICISM.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1049 TO 1200.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are sometimes disposed to think and speak of the Middle Ages,
as though by that term was to be understood a period including
several centuries, during the whole of which society was governed
by the same laws, and made but little progress. In point of fact,
however, men seldom lived faster, if such an expression be admissible,
than during the five centuries to which the term mediæval is most
strictly applied. There was then, as now, a continual expansion and
development going on, and then, as now, the development was
partly good, and partly evil. During the hundred years that elapsed
from the accession of Hugh Capet in 996, to the conquest of Jerusalem
in 1099, Christendom assumed an entirely new aspect. The
institutions of feudalism and chivalry were becoming firmly established;
the barbaric invasions had ceased, and the Crusades directed
the arms of the Christians against a common enemy, and so put an
end to the civil wars which had raged under the Carlovingian
dynasty. If these changes cannot be said to have ushered in a
period of absolute peace, they at least tended to consolidate civil
government; and the comparative state of security and order which
ensued, naturally encouraged greater intellectual activity. On the
other hand, the Saxon emperors of Germany had been replaced by
the house of Franconia, and that grievous contest had begun between
the temporal and spiritual powers which, for centuries, formed the
great political question of Europe; while the convulsions of the last
century had let loose on the Church a flood of corruption which
probably makes this period one of the saddest in her history.</p>

<p>The chronicles of a semi-barbarous age, however, possess one
charm which does not attach in an equal degree to those of more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
civilised periods. Full as they are of crimes and scandals, they
depict a state of society more keenly susceptible than our own to
the influence of master-minds. Hence they are often enough the
records of heroes, whereas our tamer annals deal less in the acts and
words of great men, than in changes of ministry. The eleventh
century groaned under the threefold scourge of simony, sensuality,
and temporal usurpation. It had the peculiar infelicity of being an
age of transition, when the children of the Church were growing
weary of submitting to the canonical discipline of ancient times,
whilst nothing had yet been established as its substitute. It was,
therefore, a time of wild license and feeble restraint. Three men,
however, arose to rule and reform their age. The first was of royal
blood, a descendant of Charlemagne and Witikind, whom we first
find studying at Toul about the year 1018, along with other princely
and ducal cousins, for Toul was always celebrated for its noble
students. Bruno of Dachsburg was the handsomest man of his
time, the idol of his family, graceful, eloquent, and learned, and a
skilled musician. The world was already predicting his success at
the court of his imperial cousin Conrad, when a trifling accident
changed his whole career. One day, the young student, after a hard
morning’s work, threw himself on the grass at his father’s castle in
Alsace, and fell asleep. An insect stung his face, and the result was
a malignant fever which brought him to the gates of death. He
rose from his sick bed to renounce all that the world had to offer,
and to embrace the monastic state. In 1026 he became Bishop of
Toul, and for two-and-twenty years devoted his energies to the
reformation of manners and the revival of discipline. At the end
of that time he was elected Pope, and, as St. Leo IX., struggled for
five years more against simony, the Berengarian heresy, and the
Greek schism. But, in the midst of his other labours, he did not
neglect letters and the arts. He caused good studies to flourish at
Rome, reformed her school of chant, and employed as his legates
learned men, such as his old schoolfellow, Cardinal Humbert, who
had acquired at Toul that Greek erudition which he used so ably
against the Photians.</p>

<p>On the day when Pope Leo entered Rome barefoot to take possession
of the Apostolic throne, he was accompanied by a Cluniac
monk, whom he had met on his journey into Italy, and well-nigh
compelled to join his train. Rome was no new scene to the monk
Hildebrand; it was there, in St. Mary’s Abbey on the Aventine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
Mount,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> that the poor carpenter’s son had received his education.
But he returned thither now to fill a very different station, for Leo
created him cardinal, and abbot of St. Paul’s; and from that time
up to the day of his death, thirty-six years later, the life of Hildebrand
forms the history of his times. The name of him whom the Church
reveres as St. Gregory VII. must suffice in this place, there remains
to be noticed a third Christian hero, a friend of both those illustrious
pontiffs, who struggled with them in the same cause, and against the
same enemies. Born at Ravenna towards the close of the tenth
century, the youngest of a large family, who only saw in him another
to divide their slender inheritance, Peter Damian was all but
abandoned in his infancy, and on the death of his parents was maintained
by a brother, who treated him as a slave, and employed him
to keep swine. The poor farm-drudge grew up without friends and
without education; but the soul that was within him had instincts
and aspirations which no ill-usage could stifle. One day he chanced
to find a piece of money lying on the ground; it was the first time
his hands had ever touched silver, and for a moment the thoughts
which might occur to other boys flashed through his brain. He
would purchase food, or clothes, or give himself an hour’s brief
enjoyment. But then came another thought: “When the food is
eaten, and the enjoyment past, what will remain to me of my money?
Better give it to the parish priest and have a mass said for my father’s
soul.” The second thought was followed; and soon afterwards his
elder brother Damian, the arch-priest of Ravenna, took pity on the
boy, and sent him to school, first at Faenza, and then at Parma,
which at that time possessed excellent masters. Peter, who in gratitude
assumed his brother’s name in addition to his own, became not
only a good scholar, but in time a professor, and his singular capacity
in this office obtained him both scholars and wealth, for, as we have
seen in the last chapter, the profession of scholasticus was beginning
to be one of profit. But he had never forgotten his early experience,
and the money that flowed in went to feed the poor, whilst he himself
persevered in the practice of rigid poverty. One day he made
the acquaintance of two poor hermits belonging to a community that
had established itself at a spot called Fonte-Avellano, at the foot of
the Umbrian Apennines. His biographer calls it a desert, but it was
a desert only in the Italian sense of he word, a solitary valley, that is,
shut in between mountains clothed with evergreen oaks, and chest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
nuts, and the silvery olive, its thickets bright with the blossoms of
the Judas-tree and the oleander, and its grass, with the starry cyclamen.
To this desert, then, Peter’s new friends conducted him, on a
visit to their hermitage, which had been founded a few years previously
by the Blessed Ludolf. He found there a community who
took the same view of human life as himself. They regarded man
as a being made up of two noble and immortal parts, that were to be
served and cherished&mdash;the soul and the intellect; and of one base
and perishable part, that was good only to be mortified&mdash;the body.
Simple men as they were, they had conceived the idea of doing
penance for the huge evil world that lay outside their wilderness.
So they lived four days a week on bread and water, allowing themselves
on the other three the indulgence of herbs, afflicted their flesh
in many ways, and divided their time between psalmody and study.
Peter embraced this life with hearty earnestness, and outstripped his
companions alike in his austerities and in his application to sacred
learning. But his light could not be hid; abbots entreated that he
might be sent to instruct their religious; his own brethren elected
him their superior; seven successive popes employed him in the
service of the Church; and, in 1057, Stephen IX. created him
cardinal bishop of Ostia. His life was spent in struggles to stem the
corruption of his age and to reform the clergy. Fleury observes
that we must not look in his writings for acuteness of reasoning; but
he had to do with men sunk in rude gross vices, which were hardly
to be remedied by metaphysics. The medicine which St. Peter
Damian prescribed for the sick world was penance; and he preached
it in a plain homely sort of way, which might possibly offend fastidious
tastes, but which had this merit about it, that it was practical,
and had results. He entered the profaned sanctuary, scourge in
hand, to drive out the unclean animals, and to overthrow the tables
of the money-changers. In the intervals between his incessant legations
to reform churches and rebuke princes, he retired to his cell at
Fonte-Avellano, and might be found there living on pulse and water,
employed in making wooden spoons, or other coarse manual labour,
and submitting, even to his eightieth year, to the same rule of life as
the youngest novice. Yet this was the most elegant scholar of his
time; nay, more, he was a poet. And we do not use the term as
classing him among the crowd of versifiers who wrote their chronicles,
and even their theological treatises in lines which, often enough as
Hallam remarks, can only be rendered into hexameters “by careful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
nursing.” He imitated neither Virgil nor Horace, but wrote in those
rhymed trochaics which many classical purists would brand as barbarisms.
Yet where shall we see richness of imagery wedded to
greater harmony of numbers than in those wonderful stanzas, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Paradisi Gloriâ</i>, wherein Paradise is depicted under the form of all
that is fairest and brightest to the poet’s eye? The sparkling of
precious gems, the blossoming of early flowers, the glory of the
autumn cornfields, and the long shining of a summer’s day, lit by a
sun that knows no setting, are painted in words that sound like the
echoes of a harpsichord. And from these sensible images of earthly
beauty he rises to that which is above sense, and sets before us the
ineffable joys of those who see the Divine Beauty face to face, and
are filled from the fountains of Eternal charity. The joys of heaven
formed, in fact, the constant subject of his meditation, and in one of
his prose treatises, speaking on this exhaustless theme, he gives utterance
to the sentiment felt by every poet, of the insufficiency of words
to express the emotions of the heart. “There is always more in the
thing itself than the mind conceives, and more in what the mind
conceives than the tongue can utter.”</p>

<p>The reform of manners so vigorously set on foot by these saints
and their many disciples was friendly to the growth of letters.
Parma attained such celebrity as to be called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysopolis</i>, or the golden
city, in the days of the great Countess Matilda, who was herself,
says Donizzo, her chaplain, more learned than many bishops, and
was never without an abundance of books. At her instance Irnerius,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lucerna Juris</i>, as he was called, began to lecture at Bologna on
Roman law about the year 1128. The cathedral schools were everywhere
revived by St. Gregory VII., who required the bishops to found
seminaries where such did not already exist, where boys should be
educated for the priesthood free of cost, certain prebends being set
apart for the support of the masters. This injunction was very
generally obeyed, and many ancient schools were revived which had
fallen into decay. Landulph tells us that at Milan, where things
had been in a very bad state, but where the mingled zeal and gentleness
of St. Peter Damian, and of St. Ariald, had effected a reform,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
the schools of philosophy were held in the porch of the cathedral,
where the clerics attended, the archbishop presiding in person. In
fact, the Italians who, in the tenth century, are represented as
having none to teach them the first rudimentary elements, had somehow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
contrived in the eleventh to possess themselves of academies
which they considered the first in the whole world.</p>

<p>A document given by Mabillon illustrates in an amusing manner
the jealousy existing at this time between the schools of Italy and
France. A certain prior of Chiusi, named Benedict, coming to the
abbey of St. Martial at Limoges, was imprudent enough to call in
question the commonly-received opinion that St. Martial was an
immediate disciple of our Lord. Of course a storm arose, its fury
bursting over the head of the luckless and too enlightened critic.
The quarrel was taken up by all the monasteries of southern Gaul;
and Ademar, a monk of Angoulême, thought it his duty to address a
circular to the French monasteries, warning them not to listen to the
horrible scandals promulgated by Benedict, whose conceit, he says,
was at the bottom of the whole affair. He attempts to pillory his
antagonist, by putting in his mouth a ridiculous speech. “I am the
nephew,” he is made to say, “of the abbot of Chiusi. He has taken
me to many cities of France and Lombardy to study grammar, and
my various masters have cost him the round sum of 2000 soldi. I
studied grammar nine years, and am studying it still. I am a most
learned man. I have two great boxes full of books, and I have not
yet read one-half of them. In fact there is not a book in all the
world that I have not got. When I leave the schools there will not
be such a doctor as myself under heaven.... I am prior of Chiusi,
and know how to write sermons.... I am so wise I could arrange
and manage an entire council. In Aquitaine there is no learning of
any kind, every one there is a dunce; if a man knows a sprinkling
of grammar, he is thought at once to be a second Virgil. In France
(that is, the province, not the kingdom of France), there is a little
more erudition, but not much. The real seat of wisdom is in
Lombardy, where I have carried on my studies.” In spite of the
sarcastic exaggeration running through this passage, we may gather
from it that Benedict had probably assumed a tone of superiority
over his Gallican neighbours, and that studies must have greatly
revived in Lombardy since the days of the Othos, to furnish the text
for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i> of this description.</p>

<p>An age of such increased intellectual activity could hardly fail to
be attended with many changes, bad as well as good. We have seen
in the last chapter that the new class of teachers who were now
springing up taught for gain or reputation, rather than with an eye to
the higher ends of education, and that thus learning in their hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
lost much of its Christian dress. The intellectual curiosity of
students induced many to seek for knowledge in distant lands, with
the same perseverance and spirit of enterprise which young knights
displayed in quest of military adventure. We can hardly in our day
appreciate the difficulties which had to be overcome by men like
Athelhard and Robert of Retines, whose student life was the very
romance of scholarship. If the stock of knowledge thus collected,
surpassed in breadth and variety that which could have been gained
in any single monastic school, it is evident, on the other hand, that
the education of these itinerant scholars must have been sadly
deficient both in mental and moral discipline, failings which were
abundantly evident in the character of the new scholastics. They
had picked up, it may be, a knowledge of medicine at Salerno, and
of mathematics at Cordova, but the claustral rule, the strict subjection
to authority, the holy atmosphere or devotion and obedience,
had not entered into their intellectual life. They had gained their
learning from the lips of professors, in order to become professors in
their turn; but a wandering life through half the cities of Europe
was but a poor exchange for the claustral discipline; and not a few
were found to embrace this kind of life for the very sake of its greater
license and freedom from restraint.</p>

<p>But though this new element was making itself perceptibly felt
in the learned world, it must not be supposed that in the eleventh
century the old system of education was at all superseded for the
cathedral and monastic schools still continued the chief seats of learning.
They even witnessed a <ins class="corr" id="tn330" title="Transcriber’s Note—“sort of classical renaissanee” changed to “sort of classical renaissance”.">sort of classical renaissance</ins>, which
sprung up under the encouragement of a crowd of masters who
directed the labours of their scholars to the imitation of ancient
models, without, however, in any way abandoning the line of
Christian studies traced out by Alcuin and his disciples. At Mans,
the office of scholasticus was held by the Blessed Hildebert a pupil
of Berengarius, and a poet and philosopher, who afterwards became
bishop of the same see, and had the distinguished honour of being
imprisoned by the Red King, for refusing, at his bidding, to pull
down the towers of his cathedral. At Autun, the cathedral schools
were directed for twenty years by Honorius, who in his treatise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Exilio Animæ</i>, reprinted in the <cite>Thesaurus Anecdotorum</cite> of Pez, has
described the course of studies followed by his pupils. To the
ordinary branches of the trivium and quadrivium, he added instructions
in physical science, and gave a distinct course of Holy Scripture.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
His lectures on rhetoric included the explanation of the best Latin
classics, and the same was done in most monastic schools of the
period. The notices become more frequent of scholars learned in
Greek and Hebrew, and the fact of their being named as engaged in
the correction of manuscripts in those languages, compels us to
believe that their learning was something more real and solid than
that which has been before noticed as rather foolishly displayed on
the pages of certain writers of the preceding centuries. Thus, Sigebert
of Gemblours, and Marbœuf of Angers, are both spoken of as
Greek and Hebrew scholars. Sigebert is said by his biographer to
have been learned in the Hebrew Scriptures, which he used in his
controversies with the Jews. He was also a good Latin classic, and
much addicted to the composition of verses in imitation of his
favourite author Horace. He gave lectures on poetry and logic in
Paris, but his vanity was not proof against temptation, and led him to
take part with Henry IV. against the Holy See. He is the author of
a chronicle and other historical works, which he made the vehicle for
conveying grave calumnies against the Roman pontiffs. Dante to
whom his character as a Ghibelline partisan was itself a recommendation,
has placed him in Paradise and notices him as lecturing on
logic in the streets of Paris, to students seated, after the custom of
the time, on bundles of straw.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to determine how much the scholars of this period
were really in advance of their predecessors. Hallam, who is generally
so sparing of his praise when speaking of any period earlier
than that of the Cinque Cento, admits that at the close of the
eleventh century a good, and even elegant school of Latin writers
was springing up; and notices the Latin vocabulary of Papias as
evincing an amount of profane learning far superior to anything that
had hitherto been known. Du Cange, however, shows that Papias
drew his materials from a dictionary which had been compiled in
the Dark Ages, namely, that published in the tenth century, by
Solomon, abbot of St. Gall’s. Still, it may be concluded that classical
studies were more universally followed than they had hitherto
been, and at the same time extraordinary activity was displayed in
the multiplication of books and the collection of libraries. Useful
results sometimes flow from human infirmities, and there is said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>to have mingled with the honest love of learning which encouraged
this activity, a certain spirit of rivalry and emulation among the
different monasteries and religious orders. The Black Monks did
not like to be cut out by the new Cistercians; and Bec, as a matter
of course, was not going to yield to Cluny. Mabillon says that it
was the peculiar pride of the Benedictine abbots of this time, to
collect large libraries, and to have their manuscripts handsomely
written and adorned. Never, therefore, was there a busier time in
the scriptorium; a finer character of writing, and a more convenient
system of abbreviation was introduced, and many abbots are mentioned
as remarkable for their skill as miniaturists. It is said,
however, I know not with what truth, that the copyists, if they got
through a greater amount of work, were often less accurate than
their brethren of the eighth and ninth centuries, and that in this, as
in other things, the proverb held good of “more haste and worse
speed.” Hallam, whilst complaining of the multiplication of
blunders, does full justice to the prodigious industry exhibited by
the monastic copyists of this particular period. As an illustration of
the subject, we may quote the account which Othlonus, the scholasticus
of St. Emmeran’s, gives of his labours. He seems to have been
a Bavarian by birth, and his first school was that of Tegernsee, in
Bavaria, a monastery which had been founded in 994, and was famous
for its teachers <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utrâque linguâ</i>, and even for its Hebrew scholars.
Here, in the twelfth century, lived the good monk Metellus, whose
eclogues, written in imitation of those of Virgil, describe the
monastic pastures and cattle, and the labours of the monks in the
fields. The library of Tegernsee was rich in classic works, and
possessed a fair illuminated copy of Pliny’s “Natural History,”
adorned with pictures of the different animals, from the cunning
hand of brother Ellinger. Medicine was likewise studied here, to
facilitate which, the monks had a good botanical garden. In such
a school Othlonus had every opportunity of cultivating his natural
taste for study, which grew by degrees to be a perfect passion. As
a child he had intended to embrace the monastic state, but the
persuasions of his father, and his own desire to give himself up exclusively
to learned pursuits, induced him to abandon this design,
and after leaving school he devoted himself for several years to
classical studies, with an ardour which his biographer finds no words
strong enough to express.</p>

<p>His only earthly desire at this time, as he himself tells us in one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
of his later spiritual treatises, was to have time to study, and abundance
of books. It would seem, however, that this excessive devotion
to human learning had its usual results in the decay of devotion.
It is thus he describes himself at this period of his life, in his versified
treatise <cite>De doctrina Spirituali</cite>. “Desiring to search into certain
subtle matters, in the knowledge of which I saw that many delighted,
to the end that I might be held in greater esteem by the world, I
made all my profit to consist in keeping company with the Gentiles.
In those days what were not to me Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,
and Tully the rhetorician?... that threefold work of Maro, and
Lucan, whom then I loved best of all, and on whom I was so intent,
that I hardly did anything else but read him.... Yet what profit did
they give me, when I could not even sign my forehead with the
cross?”</p>

<p>However, two severe illnesses wrought a great change in his way
of looking at life, and in 1032, remembering his early dedication of
himself to God, he resolved to forsake the world and take the habit
of religion in the monastery of St. Emmeran’s, at Ratisbon, where
he gave up all thoughts of secular ambition, in order to devote himself
heart and soul to the duties of his state. St. Emmeran’s was,
like Tegernsee, possessed of an excellent school and library. In the
former many good scholars were reared, such as abbot William of
Hirschau, who became as learned in the liberal arts as in the study
of the Scriptures, and who afterwards made his own school at Hirschau
one of the most celebrated in Germany. Othlonus tells us that
in this monastery he found “several men in different classes, some
reading pagan authors, others the Holy Scriptures,” and that he
began to imitate the latter, and soon learnt to relish the Sacred
Books, which he had hitherto neglected, far above the writings of
Aristotle, Plato, or even Boëthius.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen from this little sketch that Othlonus was not a
mere transcriber, and indeed he afterwards produced several treatises
on mystic theology, besides his “Life of St. Wolfgang,” and was
regarded by his brother monks as “a pious and austere man, possessed
of an immense love of books.” This love he showed not
only by reading them, but by multiplying them; and his achievements
in this kind are related by himself with a certain prolix
eloquence which, in mercy to the reader, I will somewhat abridge.</p>

<p>“I think it right,” he says, “to add some account of the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
capacity of writing which was given me by the Lord from my childhood.
When as yet a little child I was sent to school, and quickly
learnt my letters; and began long before the usual time of learning,
and without any order from the master, to learn the art of writing;
but in a furtive and unusual way, and without any teacher, so that I
got a bad habit of holding my pen in a wrong manner, nor were any
of my teachers afterwards able to correct me in that point. Many
who saw this, decided that I should never write well, but by the
grace of God it turned out otherwise. For, even in my childhood,
when, together with the other boys, the tablet was put into my
hands, it appeared that I had some notion of writing. Then, after a
time, I began to write so well and was so fond of it, that in the
monastery of Tegernsee, where I learned, I wrote many books, and
being sent into Franconia, I worked so hard as nearly to lose my
sight.... Then, after I became a monk of St. Emmeran’s, I was
induced again to occupy myself so much in writing, that I seldom
got an interval of rest except on festivals. Meantime there came
more work on me, for as they saw I was generally reading, writing,
or composing, they made me schoolmaster; by all which things I
was, through God’s grace, so fully occupied that I frequently could
not allow my body the necessary rest. When I had a mind to compose
anything, I could not find time for it, except on holidays or at
night, being tied down to the business of teaching the boys, and
transcribing what I had undertaken. Besides the books which I
composed myself I wrote nineteen missals, three books of the
Gospels, and two lectionaries; besides which I wrote four service
books for matins. Afterwards, old age and infirmity hindered me,
and the grief caused by the destruction of our monastery; but to
Him who is author of all good, and who has vouchsafed to give
many things to me unworthy, be praise eternal!” He then adds an
account of a vast number of other books written out by him and
sent as presents to the monasteries of Fulda, Hirschfeld, Lorsch,
Tegernsee, and others, amounting in all to thirty volumes. His
labours, so cheerfully undertaken for the improvement of his convent,
were perhaps surpassed by those of the monk Jerome, who
wrote out so great a number of volumes, that it is said a wagon
with six horses would not have sufficed to draw them. But neither
one nor the other are to be compared to Diemudis, a devout nun of
the monastery of Wessobrun, who, besides writing out in clear and
beautiful characters five missals, with graduals and sequences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
attached, and four other office books, for the use of the church,
adorned the library of her convent with two entire Bibles, eight
volumes of St. Gregory, seven of St. Augustine, the ecclesiastical
histories of Eusebius and Cassiodorus, and a vast number of sermons,
homilies, and other treatises, a list of which she left, as having all
been written by her own hand, to the praise of God and of the holy
apostles SS. Peter and Paul. This Diemudis was a contemporary of
Othlonus, and found time in the midst of her gigantic labours to
carry on a correspondence with Herluca, a nun of Eppach, to whom
she is said to have indited “many very sweet letters,” which were
long preserved.</p>

<p>I have mentioned as one of the scholars of St. Emmeran’s the
holy William of Hirschau, who was chosen abbot of his monastery
in 1070, and applied himself to make his monks as learned and as
indefatigable in all useful labours as he was himself. He had about
250 monks at Hirschau, and founded no fewer than fifteen other
religious houses, for the government of which he drew up a body of
excellent statutes. These new foundations he carefully supplied
with books, which necessitated constant work in the scriptorium.
And a most stately and noble place was the scriptorium of Hirschau,
wherein each one was employed according to his talent, binding,
painting, gilding, writing, or correcting. The twelve best writers
were reserved for transcribing the Scriptures and the Holy Fathers,
and one of the twelve, most learned in the sciences, presided over
the tasks of the others, chose the books to be copied, and corrected
the faults of the younger scribes. The art of painting was studied in
a separate school, and here, among others, was trained the good
monk Thiemon, who, after decorating half the monasteries of
Germany with the productions of his pencil, became archbishop of
Saltzburg, and died in odour of sanctity. The statutes with which
abbot William provided his monasteries, were chiefly drawn up from
those in use at St. Emmeran’s, but he was desirous of yet further
improving them, and in particular of assimilating them to those of
Cluny, which was then at the height of its renown. It was at his
request that St. Ulric of Cluny wrote out his “Customary,” in which,
among other things, he gives a description of the manner in which
the Holy Scriptures were read through in the refectory in the course
of the year. This “Customary” is one of the most valuable monuments
of monastic times which remains to us; it shows us the
interior of the monastery, painted by the hand of one of its inmates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
taking us through each office, the library, the infirmary, the sacristy,
the bakehouse, the kitchen, and the school. How beautiful is the
order which it displays, as observed in choir, where, on solemn days,
all the singers stood vested in copes, the very seats being covered
with embroidered tapestry! Three days in the week the right side
of the choir communicated, and the other three the left; during
Holy Week they washed the feet of as many poor as there were
brethren in the house, and the abbot added others also to represent
absent friends. When the Passion was sung, they had a custom of
tearing a piece of stuff at the words “they parted my garments;”
and the new fire of Holy Saturday was struck, not from a flint, but a
precious beryl. There were numberless beautiful rites of benediction
observed, as that of the ripe grapes, which were blessed on the
altar during mass, on the 6th of August, and afterwards distributed
in the refectory, of new beans, and of the freshly-pressed juice of the
grape. The ceremonies observed in making the altar breads were
also most worthy of note. The grains of wheat were chosen one by
one, were carefully washed and put aside in a sack, which was
carried by one known to be pure in life and conversation to the
mill. There they were ground and sifted, he who performed this
duty being clothed in alb and amice. Two priests and two deacons
clothed in like manner prepared the breads, and a lay brother,
having gloves on his hands, held the irons in which they were baked.
The very wood of the fire was chosen of the best and driest. And
whilst these processes were being gone through, the brethren engaged
ceased not to sing psalms, or sometimes recited Our Lady’s office.
A separate chapter in the “Customary” is devoted to the children
and their master, and the discipline under which they were trained
is minutely described. We seem to see them seated in their cloister
with the vigilant eye of the master presiding over their work. An
open space is left between the two rows of scholars, but there is no
one in the monastery who dare pass through their ranks. They go
to confession twice a week, and always to the abbot or the prior.
And such is the scrupulous care bestowed on their education, and
the vigilance to which they are subjected, both by day and night,
that, says Ulric, “I think it would be difficult for a king’s son to be
brought up in a palace with greater care than the humblest boy
enjoys at Cluny.”</p>

<p>This “Customary” was drawn up during the government of St.
Hugh of Cluny, whose letter to William the Conqueror displays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
something of the independence of mind with which abbots of those
days treated the great ones of the earth. William had written to
him requesting him to send some of his monks to England, and
offering him a hundred pounds for every monk he would send.
This method of buying up his monks at so much a head offended
the good abbot, who wrote back to the king declining to part with
any of his community at such a price, and adding that he would
himself give an equal sum for every good monk whom he could
draw to Cluny. During the sixty-two years that he governed his
abbey, he is said to have professed more than 10,000 subjects.
Enough has been said to show that the monastic institute was still
strong and vigorous in the eleventh century. Cluny, indeed, represented
monasticism rather in its magnificence than in the more
evangelic aspect of poverty and abasement, yet in the midst of all
her lordly splendour, she continued fruitful in saints. Even the
austere St. Peter Damian, whilst he disapproved of the wealth of the
monks, was edified at their sanctity, and left them, marvelling how
men so rich could live so holily. Their revenues were not spent on
luxury; they went to feed 17,000 poor people, and to collect a
library of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew authors, such as had not its
equal in Europe. It contained among other treasures a certain
Bible, called in the chronicle, “great, wonderful, and precious for its
writing, correctness, and rich binding, adorned with beryl stones,”
which had been written by the single hand of the monk Albert.
The following inscription inserted in the volume attests the piety as
well as the industry of the writer. “This book was written by a
certain monk of Cluny, named Albert, formerly of Treves. It was
done by the order and at the expense of the venerable abbot Pontius,
Peter being at that time the librarian, and providing all things
necessary with joy and diligence. And the aforesaid monk, in
company with a certain brother named Opizo, diligently read
through the whole book, that he might be able to improve it according
to the authority of other books; and he twice corrected it.
Therefore Brother Albert a sinner, prostrating himself at the feet of
the brethren of Cluny, humbly begs of them to pray to God for himself
and for his father, that they may obtain the forgiveness of their
sins.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere also the monastic schools continued to produce a
number of excellent masters who thoroughly entered into the revival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
of classical studies, which we have noticed as having at this time
sprung up. At Fleury the monk Raoul taught the art of versification
to a crowded audience, and in his own poems advocated the
study of the ancient models, especially of Horace. Quotations from
the same poet, as well as from Virgil and Statius, not unfrequently
appear in the lives of the saints, and even the sermons of this
period, a fact not adduced as an instance of the good taste, but
simply of the erudition, of the authors. In the school of Stavelot,
even Greek poetry was studied. Here was trained the celebrated
Wibald, successively abbot of Stavelot, Monte Cassino, and Corby.</p>

<p>The letters and other remains of this remarkable man have been
inserted by Martene in his collection, and throw much light on the
history of the times. He filled several important offices under the
Emperor Conrad, who confided to him the education of his son and
successor Henry; but whilst constantly immersed in public business
he failed not to labour for the good cause which lay at the heart of
every true monk, the multiplication of books, and the encouragement
of learning. Thus among his letters we find one addressed in
1149 to the scholasticus of Corby, in which he enumerates among
the writers to be studied in the school, Pythagoras, Plato, Sophocles,
and Simonides, a sufficient proof that Greek literature was then
cultivated in certain seminaries, and that the knowledge of that
language was not confined, as Hallam suggests, to the occasional
singing of a Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Kyrie</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctus</i>. There are other letters
addressed to the superiors of monasteries whom he engaged to assist
him in the collection of books. Among these was the abbot of
Hildesheim, from whom he hoped to obtain a complete copy of the
Offices of Cicero. His petition for these is in a certain sense apologetic,
for, from the days of St. Jerome, religious men were wont to
be a little sensitive, lest too great a love of the Latin orator should
expose them to the charge of being a <em>Ciceronian</em> rather than a
<em>Christian</em> student. Something of this sort had been playfully hinted
at by the abbot of Hildesheim, and Wibald replies: “We do not
serve the dishes of Cicero at the first or principal table; but when
replenished with better food we partake of them as of sweetmeats
that are served for dessert.” Sometimes his letters are addressed to
friends who have visited his library, and who shared in his literary
tastes. “I wish,” he writes to the Archbishop of Bremen, “that you
would come again and remain longer with us, and, as you promised,
turn over the volumes on our shelves. I wish we might have this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
pleasure together in peace and quiet; there is surely no greater
happiness to be enjoyed in life.”</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, superfluous to multiply illustrations of this kind,
but I cannot resist adding to the names already cited that of
Marianus Scotus, whom some call an Irishman, and some a Scot,
while others affirm him to have been an honest Northumbrian, and
a member of the family of Bede.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He died towards the end of the
eleventh century, having been successively monk in the abbeys of
Cologne, Fulda, and Mayence, and professor of theology some years
in that of Ratisbon. He was a poet, and the author of a Chronicle
frequently quoted as one of the best mediæval histories, and continued
by later writers. His biographers say of him that his
countenance was so beautiful, and his manners so simple, that no
one doubted he was inspired in all he said and did by the Holy
Ghost. A most indefatigable writer, he transcribed the whole Bible
with sundry commentaries, and that not once but repeatedly.
Moreover he drew out of the deep sea of the holy Fathers, certain
sweet waters for the profit of his soul, which he collected in prolix
volumes. With all this he found spare moments which he devoted
to charitable labours on behalf of poor widows, clerks, and scholars,
for whose benefit he multiplied psalters, manuals, and other pious
little books, which he distributed to them free of cost for the
remedy of his soul. Who will refuse to believe that such loving
toils as these were found worthy to receive the miraculous token of
favour related in the old legend? “One night,” says the annalist,
“the brother whose duty it was, having forgotten to give him
candles, Marianus nevertheless continued his work without them;
and when the brother, recollecting his omission, came late at night
to his cell, he beheld a brilliant light streaming through the chinks
of the door, and going in softly, found that it proceeded from the
fingers of the monk’s left hand, and he saw and believed.”</p>

<p>In some writers of this time there are indications of increased
attention being paid to natural phenomena, and the geographical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
notices introduced into the chronicle of Otto of Frisingia are praised
by the authors of the <cite>Histoire Littéraire</cite> for their exactness and
intelligence. A very singular and interesting fact is recorded in the
chronicle of Marianus (or rather in its later continuation), which,
though of a supernatural character, may perhaps be admitted among
the scientific notices of the time. I allude to the vision seen and
described by the Blessed Alpais of Cudot, who saw in rapture the
earth hanging suspended in space shaped like a globe, or rather a
spheroid, for she calls it not perfectly round, but egg-shaped. It was
surrounded by water, and the sun appeared of a vastly greater size.
Equally remarkable in another branch of science are the speculations
of Ithier, a monk of Limoges, on the faculties of the mind
corresponding to different parts of the brain, in which we catch a
first glimpse of the modern theory of phrenology. Nor must it be
supposed that the classical and scientific studies, which excited so
much interest, caused the cultivation of the vulgar dialects to be
forgotten. Abbots and bishops often preached in Romance, like St.
Vital of Savigny and Hildebert of Mans, though the latter is said to
have succeeded better in Latin. St. Bernard delivered his exhortations
to his brethren not in Latin but Romance, for the benefit of
the lay-brothers who were ignorant of the learned tongues, as
Mabillon labours to prove. A vast number of translations were
likewise made into the popular dialects, and about the end of
the eleventh century the monk Grimoald published a version in
Romance of the entire Bible; this translation being made nearly a
century before that of the Waldenses, though the latter is very
generally represented to be the earliest known version of the
Scriptures in any vulgar tongue.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>It is evident, then, that all the learning of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries was not swallowed up by the new race of scholastics, nor
was every scholastic a Berengarius. Yet there is a certain change
perceptible in many of those who at this time attained to literary
eminence, and a greater predominance of the philosophic element,
consequent in some degree from the nature of the studies rendered
popular in the school of Bec. We begin more frequently to meet with
tales of scholars who, in the midst of their learned pursuits, were overtaken
with a dread of the perils which beset their course, and sought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
to escape them by flying into the desert. The cloisters were peopled
with such refugees from the schools, who, like Lanfranc, often reappeared
after a while to resume the weapons of human science,
which they had thought to fling aside for ever, and use them in the
service of their Master.</p>

<p>Of these converts were St. Bruno, the founder of the Carthusians,
and Odo of Tournai. Bruno is said to have studied at Tours under
Berengarius, though this appears doubtful. In 1056 the scholasticus
of Rheims having resigned his charge, that he might devote himself
exclusively to the affairs of his own salvation, Gervase, Archbishop
of Rheims, promoted Bruno to the office, which by this time had
become associated to that of Chancellor of the diocese, and gave its
holder a certain superiority over the other diocesan schools. Bruno
continued to fill this responsible post for twenty years, during which
time he numbered among his pupils Odo, afterwards Pope Urban II.,
and many of the greatest prelates of the time. He was reckoned the
first philosopher, theologian, and poet of France, and by writers of
his own day is extolled as “the doctor of doctors, the glory of the
Church, the model of good men, and the mirror of the whole world.”
The romantic story which ascribes his conversion to religion to the
horror caused by the voice which came from the dead body of a
certain eminent doctor, proclaiming his damnation, is now universally
rejected as the production of a later age. In fact, St. Bruno has
himself related the manner in which his resolution was first formed
in a letter addressed to Raoul, provost of Rheims, wherein he reminds
him of a certain day when they were walking with another canon
named Fulcius, in the garden adjoining his house, conversing together
of the vanities of the world. “Then it was,” he says, “that the Holy
Spirit moved us to renounce all perishable things, and embrace the
monastic life that we might merit life eternal.” It would also appear
that a grievous case of simony, which had scandalised the diocese,
powerfully wrought on Bruno’s mind, and moved him to fly from a
world so hedged about with temptations. He was followed into his
retreat by a number of his former scholars; but it was not until 1084
that they at last determined on the way of life they should choose, and,
receiving the monastic habit from the hands of St. Hugh of Grenoble,
laid the foundation of the Carthusian Order, which took its name
from the desert they had chosen for their abode. In after years the
order continued to be largely recruited from the same class whence
their first founder had been drawn. Many a fine scholar came to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
wild rocks of the Chartreuse to seek in obscurity for a peace which he
found by experience the world of intellect could never give; and
Bulæus informs us that no order of monks received among their
ranks so many members of Paris University as did these austere and
penitential recluses.</p>

<p>Odo, or Oudart, the other convert to whom allusion has been
made, first attracted notice as a teacher at Toul, a city which had
always been rich in schools and schoolmasters, and which had felt a
special pride in keeping up its learned reputation, since 1048, when
it had sent its bishop to fill the chair of St. Peter in the person of St.
Leo IX. Odo’s fame reached the ears of the canons of Tournai, who
entreated him to take charge of their cathedral school, which he
accordingly governed for five years. A skilful teacher, and a devourer
of books, Odo possessed extraordinary powers of labour, and when
any literary work was in hand, he rested neither day nor night till it
was accomplished. He was also a great friend of method and good
moral discipline, but as yet he had been too exclusively taken up
with the cares and pleasures of his profession to give much thought to
spiritual things. Or perhaps we might rather say that he hardly knew
of their existence. Like other busy, hard-working men, he was swept
along in the tide of daily life, and thought it much to preserve a
character of stainless honour and respectability. His success as a
teacher was so great, that disciples came to him from all parts of
France, as well as from Flanders, Italy, and Saxony. The city of
Tournai became literally filled with students, who might be seen
disputing together in the public streets: and as you drew near the
school you would see them walking with the master, or seated around
him; or, in the evening, standing with him at the church door, while
he taught them the various constellations, and explained to them the
course of the stars.</p>

<p>Odo was as remarkable for his virtue as his learning. He took all
his disciples to the church with him daily. They never numbered
fewer than two hundred; but he made them walk two-and-two through
the streets, he himself bringing up the rear, and enforcing a discipline
as strict as would have been observed in the most regular monastery.
No one ventured to speak to his companion, or to look right or left,
and in choir they might have been taken for monks of Cluny. He
did not allow them to frequent the company of women, or to wear any
kind of finery; and if they transgressed his orders in these respects,
he turned them out of his school. At the hours when he gave his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
lectures no layman was allowed to enter the cloisters, which were at
other times the resort of the public. So strict was he in this, that he
did not hesitate to exclude Everard, the Castellan of Tournai, a nobleman
of power and influence; for it was Odo’s principle that a man
must not deviate a hair’s-breadth from his duty from the motive of
human respect. By these means he won the love and esteem of
every one: canons and people alike spoke well of him, though some
were found to say that his regularity of life sprang rather from philosophy
than religion.</p>

<p>He had directed his school for about five years, when one day, a
certain clerk having brought him St. Augustine’s “Treatise on Free-will,”
he purchased it, merely with the view of increasing his library,
and threw it into a coffer among some other books without looking
at it, for his taste inclined him rather to the study of Plato than of
the Fathers. About two months afterwards, however, as he was
explaining Boëthius to his disciples, he came to the fourth book of
the “Consolations of Philosophy,” in which the author treats of
Free-will. Remembering the book he had lately purchased on the
same subject, he sent for it, and having read two or three pages, was
struck with the beauty of the style; and calling his pupils, said to
them, “I own that until now I was ignorant how agreeable and
eloquent are the writings of St. Augustine;” and that day and the
following he read to them from this work, explaining its difficulties
as he proceeded.</p>

<p>In this way he came to that passage in the third book, wherein
St. Augustine compares the soul of the sinner to a slave condemned
to some vile and disgusting labour. Odo sighed as he read the
powerful words of the writer, exclaiming, “How striking is this comparison!
it seems as if written expressly for us men of science. We
adorn the corrupt world with the little stock of learning which we
possess, and after death, perhaps, are not found worthy of eternal
happiness, because we have done God no service; but have used
our intellects for vanity and worldly glory!” With these words he
rose from his chair, and going into the church, remained there in
floods of tears, his scholars meanwhile remaining astonished and
perplexed. From that day he gradually discontinued his lectures,
and began to frequent the church more diligently, and to distribute
in alms all the money he received from his pupils. He also fasted
so rigorously that his appearance soon completely changed, and he
became so thin and attenuated as scarcely to be recognised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span></p>

<p>The rumour soon ran through the town that Odo, the famous
doctor, was about to abandon the world. Four of his disciples
resolved never to quit him, and made him promise to do nothing
except in concert with them. Monks and abbots from every religious
house in the neighbourhood of Tournai, wanted Odo to join
their communities, but his disciples preferred the rule of the canons
as being easier than that of the monks. Rabod, the Bishop of
Tournai, accordingly made over to them an old church, part of an
abbey which had been destroyed by the Normans, and they took
possession of it in 1092. Two years later they resolved on embracing
the monastic rule, and the bishop giving his consent, Odo was
elected first abbot of the restored abbey of Tournai. Though he
had fled to the cloister to escape from the pride of the schools, he
did not neglect the cause of learning. Like most of the religious
superiors of his day, he gave much time and trouble to the formation
of a good library and scriptorium, and used to make an innocent
boast of the many good writers whom the Lord had given him.
Had you gone into his scriptorium, says his successor, you would
have seen twelve youths, sitting in silence, most diligently engaged
in copying manuscripts, at tables made for the purpose. And he
enumerates among the books so transcribed the works of St. Jerome
and St. Gregory, and all that he could collect of Bede, Isidore,
Ambrose, Austin, and the Lord Anselm of Bec.</p>

<p>About this time the rival philosophical sects known as the Realists
and Nominalists began to attract attention. The questions in dispute
between them regarded the validity and existence of <em>universal
ideas</em>. The expression requires explanation. An idea is the representation
in the mind of some impression made on the senses by an
external object. These ideas may be either <em>particular</em> or <em>universal</em>.
They are particular when they correspond to some individual object,
as <em>John Smith</em>, or <em>that tree</em>. They are universal when we separate
them from any individual object, and conceive them as corresponding
to something which is to be found in many individuals, whereby
these may be classified together, as when we speak of <em>men</em> or <em>trees</em>.
According to the scholastics, there are five kinds of such universal
ideas, namely, <em>species</em>, <em>genus</em>, <em>difference</em>, <em>property</em> and <em>accident</em>. The
species includes many individuals, as <em>sheep</em>, <em>oak</em>. The genus includes
many species, as <em>animal</em>, <em>tree</em>. Difference is something which distinguishes
one species from another belonging to the same genus.
<em>Property</em>, or essential attribute, is what necessarily belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
essence of a thing; as when we say of a globe that it is <em>round</em>.
Accident is some attribute to be found in a thing which is not
necessary to its existence, as if we were to say of the same globe
that it is <em>green</em>. We are able to hold these ideas in our mind,
abstracted from any object, and so we come to have the abstract
ideas of men, animals, trees, roundness, or whiteness, without connecting
them with any particular individual. But the Nominalists
denied the existence of such ideas, and declared the above distinctions
to be mere sounds of the voice, corresponding to no external
reality. They knew what was meant by a wise man, or a white
horse, but professed themselves unable to comprehend what was
meant by <em>wisdom</em> or <em>whiteness</em>. The Realists, on the other hand,
appealing to the authority of Boëthius, contended that these ideas
were real and existent.</p>

<p>Both parties numbered great names in their ranks. Odo of
Tournai was a partisan of the Realists, as was also the Blessed
Robert of Arbrisselles. At the head of the Nominalists appeared
his fellow-student and professor in the Paris schools, Roscelin, a
canon of Compeigne, and a man whose character too closely
resembled that of Berengarius. He seems to have adopted novel
and startling opinions as a means of drawing the eyes of men on
himself, and the manner in which he applied his philosophical
method of reasoning to revealed doctrines, specially that of the Holy
Trinity, resulted in actual heresy, and brought on him in 1092 the
condemnation of the Council of Soissons. Taking refuge in
England, he there met with a vigorous opponent in the person of
St. Anselm, who, whilst freely admitting, and even advocating the
exercise of the intellectual powers on the mysteries of faith, marked
out the limits between faith and reason, and severely condemned the
presumption of those who would attempt to make reason the test of
faith. He declares that we must seek the intelligence of those
things that we already believe; that reason is not the means by
which we attain to faith, but rather that by which we enjoy the
evidence and contemplation of the mysteries which we already
believe: and that right order demands that we should first receive
the profound truths of faith before we dare to exercise our reason
upon them.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> As time went on, and both sects pushed their philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
views to extremes, grave errors were charged against
both, and the foundations were laid of many forms of modern
Rationalism.</p>

<p>Paris was now rapidly becoming the centre of scholastic activity.
The fame of her masters spread over Europe, and among them were
Lambert, a disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Manegold, whose very
daughters were learned, and opened a school for the education of
their own sex, Anselm of Laon and Bernard of Chartres. John of
Salisbury, whose favourite master, William de Conches, had himself
been a pupil of Bernard’s, has left us an interesting account of the
method of this last-named teacher. He explained all the best
authors, not confining himself to grammar strictly so called, but
making his pupils observe all the refinements of rhetoric. He
pointed out the propriety of certain terms and metaphors, and the
best order and arrangement of a subject; and showed the variety of
styles to be used according to the different matters treated of by a
writer. If any passage occurred in their reading referring to other
sciences, he took pains to explain it, according to the capacity of
his hearers. He was careful to cultivate their memory, making
them learn and recite choice passages from the classic historians,
poets, and philosophers; requiring them one day to give an exact
account of what they had heard or read the day previous. He was
always exhorting them to read much in private, but not indiscriminately,
directing them to avoid what was only fit to feed curiosity,
and to content themselves with the works of standard authors. For,
he used to say, quoting Quinctilian, “it is a great weakness to read
all that every miserable writer has to say on every subject, and only
loads the memory with superfluous and worthless things.”</p>

<p>As he knew that it is to very little purpose to hear or study
examples unless we accustom ourselves to reproduce the treasures
thus stored up in the memory, he was anxious that his pupils should
every day compose something both in prose and verse, and he
established conferences among them wherein they mutually questioned
and answered one another, the utility of which exercise John
of Salisbury speaks of very highly; “provided,” as he observes,
“that charity govern the emulation displayed in such encounters, so
that while we make progress in letters we still preserve humility.
For a man should not serve two masters so opposed one to the
other as learning and vice.”</p>

<p>This was also the rule observed by Bernard, who maintained that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
the first and principal key to knowledge was Humility, to which he
assigned Poverty as a companion. The subjects on which he exercised
his scholars were always fitted to cherish both faith and good
morals. And the work of each day was finished with the recitation
of the “Our Father,” and a brief prayer for the dead.</p>

<p>Anselm of Laon was a teacher of much the same character, and,
if possible, of greater renown. He and his brother Radulph were
called by Guibert de Nogent the two eyes of the Latin Church, and
by their knowledge of the Scriptures converted many heretics.
Some of their pupils were as famous as themselves, such as Hugh
Metellus, a great lover of the classics, whose flow of language was so
great that he dictated to two secretaries at once, and could improvise
a thousand verses, standing on one leg, and who was induced by the
teaching of his pious masters to exchange a life of worldly vanity,
the love of dress and delicate diet, for the austere regimen of a
canon regular of Toul. Another of Anselm’s scholars was William
de Champeaux, under whom the Paris schools first attained that
pre-eminence which they maintained in the world of letters down to
the period of the Revolution. After studying successively under
Manegold and Anselm, he was appointed archdeacon of the Church
of Paris, and master of the Cathedral school, where he taught logic,
rhetoric, and theology, with great success. And about the year
1100 his reputation attracted one disciple whose name is indelibly
associated with the literary history of the period,&mdash;the celebrated
Peter Abelard.</p>

<p>Abelard’s choice of a scholar’s life is said to have been influenced
in the first instance by his dislike of the profession of arms. Nature,
while it had given him an insatiable desire for fame and worldly
glory, had denied him the gift of personal courage, and he himself
made no secret of the feeling which, as he said, had moved him to
enrol himself under the banners of Minerva, rather than those of
Mars. His subtle mind was very early devoted to the study of
logic, but not satisfied with the teaching to be found in his own
diocese of Nantes, he led a wandering life for some time, passing
from school to school; and at last found his way to Paris, where
William de Champeaux was then at the height of his reputation as a
teacher of dialectics. The brilliant qualities of his new pupil at first
won the heart of his master, but erelong Abelard began to show
signs of that presumption and contempt of every one’s attainments
except his own, which kept him at war with all his contemporaries.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
He came to the lecture rooms less with the view of learning than
with the secret hope of outshining his fellow-students and perplexing
his master. He was perpetually proposing vexatious questions, for
the purpose of entrapping the latter in some logical subtlety; and
affecting to consider that William had shown himself unable to
answer these difficulties, he disdained any longer to be the scholar
of one whom he considered his inferior, and determined on setting
up a school for himself.</p>

<p>Unable to do this in Paris, where the influence of William de
Champeaux was at that time all-powerful, he established himself first
at Mélun, and then at Corbeil, which was nearer to the capital.
He was but twenty-two when he first appeared before the world as
an independent professor, and soon made himself talked of for his
brilliancy, his fluency, and the vehemence with which he attempted
to make the <ins class="corr" id="tn348" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Errata: Page 348, line 15 from top, for “science” read “art”.">art</ins> of logic supersede all the <ins class="corr" id="tn348b" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Errata: Page 348, line 15 from top, for “seven” read “other”.">other</ins> liberal arts,
which he was accustomed to treat with contempt. His passion for
glory soon brought him back to Paris, where William de Champeaux was
now archdeacon, and head of the cathedral school. Abelard renewed
his attacks on his old master, and that with such success, that the
cloisteral schools became deserted, and the fickle audience flocked
to the lectures of the new professor. The circumstance seems to
have touched the heart of William with a contempt for intellectual
renown which was so easily won and lost, and resigning his school,
he retired among the canons regular of St. Victor, a religious
house destined to play a great part in the history of the future
university. This was in 1109, and, by the advice of Hildebert, Bishop
of Mans, who wrote to the new canon, congratulating him on “the step
by which he had at last become a true philosopher,” William opened
a school within his monastery, which afterwards produced several
illustrious theologians, who are all distinguished by the surname of
St. Victor.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue the rivalries of the two professors
through all their windings; in 1113 William was raised to the see
of Châlons, a circumstance which seems to have first induced
Abelard to study theology, with the hope of attaining similar
honours. Accordingly, we next find him at Laon, attending the
school of Anselm, now dean of that church, whom, however, he very
soon declared to be altogether unworthy of his great renown. “His
learning was,” he said, “nothing but foliage without fruit; long
custom, rather than any real merit, had acquired him a name. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
you consulted him on any difficulty, you came away just as wise as
you went. There was nothing but abundance of fine words, without
a grain of sense or reason.” So, in despair of finding a master
wise enough to teach one of his genius, he resolved to do without
one, and, with the help of a commentary, began to give lectures on
the prophet Ezechiel. His wit, his fluency, and his singular charms
of voice and manner, veiled the real shallowness of his theological
attainments, and, on returning to Paris, he succeeded in gaining
what had been for so many years the great object of his ambition,
the direction of the cathedral school. Then began the period of his
extraordinary popularity; disciples flocked to him from all parts of
France and Germany, as well as from Rome and England. His
vanity easily persuaded him that he was not merely the greatest, but
the only philosopher of his time; all the world hung on his eloquence,
but amid the long catologue of his admirers, none was to
be found so bewitched with his merits as he was himself.</p>

<p>Abelard’s teaching bore the character of his own restless and
impatient genius. Disdainful of anything which did not promise
quick results, he aimed at presenting his disciples with a philosophy
which professed to lead them to the possession of wisdom by a royal
road. The trivium and quadrivium were to be consigned to
oblivion; the classics and the Fathers might alike grow dusty on
the shelves, logic was to be all in all, and the philosopher and the
theologian might abandon every other study, provided they perfected
themselves in the art which St. Bernard characterised with caustic
wit, as “that of ever studying, and never reaching the truth.”
Abelard’s condemnation of the classics is worth noticing, as showing
the similarity of mind which existed between him and Berengarius,
whom Guitmond describes as “making no account of the opinions
of his masters, and despising the liberal arts.” In neither of them
did this condemnation arise from a preponderance of the Christian
sense; but from their repugnance to objective realities.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Their
philosophy was in short that of which the apostle speaks, when he
condemns the “vain babblings” of those who “desire to be teachers
of the law,” which differed little from the “foolish questionings” of
the sophists. The effect of these new doctrines was to inaugurate a
scholastic revolution. One by one the fair branches of the tree of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
science were severed from the trunk, till at last nothing remained
but the exercise of subtle and captious argumentation, wherein logic
came to be used not as a means but an end, and the scholar was no
longer led to seek for truth as his object, but to rest content with
the search after it.</p>

<p>Thus passed several years, during which Abelard had earned a
fame, brilliant indeed beyond that of any of his contemporaries, but
unhappily one which left his moral reputation far from stainless. In
1117 we find him in the abbey of St. Denis, where he had taken
refuge from the disgrace entailed on him by his connection with
Heloïsa. Even here his insupportable vanity was not long before it
betrayed itself in the criticisms he passed on his abbot and his
brother monks, among whom he seems to have aspired to act as the
reformer. The abbot longed to get rid of so troublesome a subject,
and the opportunity of doing so soon presented itself. Crowds of
students began to clamour at the gates of St. Denis for their old
master, and to implore him to reopen his school. He therefore
resumed his lectures, but unable to rest contented with teaching
only what had been taught before him, he began to introduce logical
subtleties into his theological views, and put forth certain explanations
on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, which raised a storm of
opposition. His chief opponents were Alberic and Lotulf, two
former disciples of Anselm of Laon, and William of Champeaux.
They not only attacked his opinions as heterodox, but complained
that he had no right to teach at all. His position as a professor
was, they said, altogether irregular, for, contrary to the established
usages of the Paris schools, he taught <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine magistro</i>.</p>

<p>This term requires a little explanation; and shows us the germ
of what soon afterwards developed into the system of university
graduation. According to established custom, no scholar could be
licensed to <em>teach</em> publicly who had not previously gone through a
regular course of study under some approved doctor. But Abelard
had had no master in theology, except himself; for, as we have
seen, he gave up his attendance in Anselm’s school through contempt
for his inferiority, and had at once begun to teach a science
which in reality he had never studied. At a Council assembled at
Soissons, his Treatise on the Holy Trinity was condemned, and he
himself required to cast it into the fire, and to make public profession
of the faith by reciting the creed of St. Athanasius, which he
did with many tears and sighs, after which he was sent back to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
monastery of St. Denys. He had not been there long, however,
when a controversy which he thought fit to raise on the question of
the identity of St. Denys, the Areopagite, with the patron of the
abbey, got him into fresh trouble, and he fled from the monastery
to the territory of the Count of Champagne, where he fixed his
residence in a beautiful solitude near Nogent, which was soon found
out by his disciples. “They came crowding to me,” he writes,
“from all parts, and leaving the towns and cities, were content to
dwell in the wilderness. Instead of spacious houses, they set up for
themselves little tents, and put up gladly with wild herbs instead of
delicate viands. People said one to another, ‘Behold the world is
gone after him.’ At last, as my little oratory would not hold them,
they enlarged it, building it of wood and stone.” To this new
building he gave the name of the <em>Paraclete</em>, and it might truly have
been his consolation could he have learnt wisdom from the past,
and bowed his erratic genius under the yoke of faith. But the
school of the Paraclete soon resounded with new errors; to the
former opinions put forth regarding the Holy Trinity, were now
added equally heterodox views on the subject of grace and original
sin, which were at once discerned and denounced by two saints who
then illuminated the church with their doctrine and their virtue&mdash;St.
Norbert, and St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Abelard, whose natural
cowardice shrank from the prospect of new dangers, endeavoured to
escape the consequences of his own imprudence by abandoning the
Paraclete, and accepting the government of St. Gildas’ abbey; but
the uncouth manners and language of the monks filled him with
repugnance, or perhaps it would be truer to say, the monastic
routine proved insufferable to one who had nothing of the real monk
about him. In 1126, therefore, we find him once more teaching in
the schools of St. Geneviève. He was never really at home save in
the Professor’s chair, but unhappily he never filled it without betraying
himself into some of the audacities of unorthodox philosophy.
Soon his old errors were reproduced, and called forth the zeal of St.
Bernard, who protested with all the force of his nervous eloquence
against the strange assemblage of heresies to be found united in the
teaching of a single man. “When he speaks of the Holy Trinity,”
he says, “it is in the style of Arius; he is a Pelagian when he treats
of grace, and a second Nestorius when he speaks of the Person of
Jesus Christ. His vanity,” continues the saint, “is such that he
brags as if there were nothing in <ins class="corr" id="tn351" title="Transcriber’s Note—“heaven and earth he did no tknow” changed to “heaven and earth he did not know”.">heaven and earth he did not know</ins>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
and in truth he knows a little of everything except himself.” In his
190th Epistle, addressed to Pope Innocent II., St. Bernard sums up
all the errors of Abelard, who had ventured to deny, and even to
ridicule, the doctrine of Redemption, which he presumptuously
declared illogical, declaring that our Lord came only to instruct us
by His Word and Example. His final condemnation took place at
the Council of Sens, which imposed silence on him for ever, a
sentence confirmed by the authority of Pope Innocent II. This
condemnation might possibly have had no better result than that of
Soissons, had it not been for the charity of the Venerable Peter of
Cluny, at whose monastery Abelard stopped on his way to Rome,
where he purposed to appeal against his sentence. The holy abbot
succeeded in drawing from him a recantation of his errors; he
induced him to renounce the scholastic career, which had been
the source of so many temptations, and frankly to submit to the
judgment of the Council and the Pope. More than this, he exerted
himself to effect a personal reconciliation between Abelard and St.
Bernard, and lastly, he offered to the wounded spirit of the unhappy
scholar a secure and sheltered retreat in his own community, where,
under the habit of religion, the Professor of St. Geneviève spent the
last years of his life in the exercise of piety and penance.</p>

<p>There then, let us leave him, in his poor cell with its wooden
candlestick and its crucifix, with the Holy Scriptures and a few
treatises of the Fathers for his only library; defeated, as some
might say, put to silence, and extinguished&mdash;but with his heart, at
last, at peace. Well might he have exclaimed with the Psalmist,
“It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me!” A change was
wrought in him so great, that, as we read the words in which his
good abbot describes it, we can scarcely recognise the old Abelard of
former years. “Never did I see a man more humble,” writes Peter
the Venerable, “whether in gesture, habit, or countenance. He read
continually, prayed often, and kept silence at all times, unless when
forced to speak; and after his reconciliation with the Holy See,
offered the Holy Sacrifice almost daily, and occupied himself only
with meditating or teaching me truths of religion or philosophy.” A
marvellous change indeed; and happy were it if all who incurred
the same censures could follow in the same course.</p>

<p>We have seen that the rationalistic errors of Abelard found their
ablest opponent in St. Bernard, who had conceived a distrust of the
new philosophy when studying as a mere boy in the canon’s school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
at Chatillon, where the fashionable scholasticism was just then
beginning to be introduced. He seems to have felt an instinctive
dread of its ultimate tendencies, and to have preserved during his
whole life the sentiments resulting from his early experience of what
his biographer Geoffery of Igny designates as the “wisdom of the
world.” Closely united to him in their theological views, were the
great scholars of St. Victor’s, Hugh, Richard, and Adam. Hugh of
St. Victor, the third prior in succession from William de Champeaux,
was styled the second Augustine, from his devoted admiration of that
Father. Brought up in a house of canons regular in Saxony, he
bore testimony in after life to the care they bestowed on his education.
“I do not fear to certify,” he says, “that they neglected no
means of perfecting me in the sciences, and even instructed me in
many things which might be thought trifling and extraordinary.”
These words occur in his <cite>Didascalion</cite>, or Treatise on Studies, which
he drew up with the view of remedying the disorderly and unmethodical
manner in which most scholars then pursued their academic
labours. In it he gives an interesting account of his own early life
as a scholar. “I never despised anything that belonged to erudition,”
he says; “when I was a scholar I studied the names of everything I
saw. I committed to memory all the sentences, questions, replies,
and solutions I had heard and learnt during the day; and I used to
describe the figures of geometry on the floor with charcoal. I do
not say this to boast of my knowledge, which is nothing, but to
show that he proceeds best who proceeds with order. You will find
many things in histories and other books, which taken in themselves
seem of little profit, but which nevertheless are useful and necessary
when taken in connection with other things.” Hugh, like all the
disciples of this school, advocated the old system, according to which
all the parts of knowledge stood in mutual relation to one another,
and theology dominated over the whole. In his Treatise <cite>De
Vanitate Mundi</cite>, he describes an imaginary school, in which is no
doubt depicted that of his own monastery. The students are described
divided into groups, according to the different subjects on
which they are engaged. All the liberal arts are cultivated in turn,
and while the fingers of some are employed in designing or colouring
an illuminated page, others are studying the nature of herbs, or
the constitution of the human frame. As a spiritual writer, Hugh of
St. Victor is considered to be surpassed by his disciple Richard of
St. Victor, a Scotchman by birth, and one of the greatest mystic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
theologians of the Church. The special doctrines insisted on by
this school were those which put forth faith, and not reason, as the
ground of certainty, and maintained that reason was to be exercised
only to demonstrate the truths that were held by faith. Abelard, in
his extravagant exaltation of the claims of reason, had gone so far
in his “Introduction to Theology,” as to define faith as an opinion,
and to depreciate a too ready belief, praising that cautious philosophy
which does not yield its faith till it has subjected all things to the
test of reason. To believe without doubting, according to this view
of things, was the religion of women and children; to doubt all
things before we believe them was alone worthy of the dignity of
man. The scholars of St. Victor not only vindicated the true claims
of faith, but they sought to prove that faith itself must rest on the
foundation stone of charity. They loved to remind their disciples
of those words of Our Lord, “If any man will do the will of God
he shall know of the doctrine.” Charity, they said, is then the
foundation, and Humility the key, to all true science, and we can
understand the Truth of God only in proportion as we obey it.
They did not seek to set aside the just use of the reason, but to
assign it limits, and to prohibit the search after things confessedly
above the grasp of human intellect. “What is it to be wise,” asks
Hugo of St. Victor, “but to love God? for love is wisdom.” He
complains of the cavilling spirit of the dialecticians who would fain
turn the simplest precepts of the Gospel into matter of dispute. If
they read that we are to love our neighbour as ourselves, they begin
to argue, saying, “If I love one man as myself, then I must love
three or four men more than myself;” and this they style seeking
truth. Again, he blames the conceit of those who, ignorant of the
very first elements, will condescend to study nothing but the sublimest
matters, forgetting that the beginning of all discipline is
humility. Neither would he endure that presumptuous spirit which
gloried in the subtlety of its own powers, but, like a true disciple of
St. Augustine, desired that reliance on Divine Grace should be the
foundation of the whole spiritual and intellectual edifice.</p>

<p>Perfectly in accordance with this teaching was that of John of
Salisbury, who exposed the vain pretensions of those who ought to
make philosophy consist in a barren exercise of the reasoning powers.
“Philosophy,” he says, “is nothing else but the love of God, and if
that love be extinguished philosophy vanishes away. All studies
worthy of that end must tend to the increase of charity, and he who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
acquires or increases charity has gained the highest object of philosophy.
This, therefore, is the true rule of philosophy, that all learning
and all reading should be made conducive to truth and charity,
and then the choir of virtues will enter into the soul as into a temple
of God. They most impudently err who think that philosophy consists
in mere words, who multiply phrases and propose a thousand
ridiculous little questions, endeavouring to perplex their hearers that
they may seem more learned than Dædalus. But though eloquence
is a useful and noble study, this loquacity of vain disputation is a
most hateful thing.” Truth, as all agreed, was the only object of
science; but whilst Abelard and his followers sought this truth in
the subjective reasonings of their own minds, the mystics of St.
Victor’s school declared that it was not to be sought by the understanding
alone, but by the heart and will. For what is Truth, they
asked, but God Himself? Who is to be sought by love rather than
by science. He therefore who seeks God, seeks the highest truth,
and embraces it when it finds Him. It knows all things in proportion
as it knows more of God, Whom not to know is darkness.
And it knows all things in Him, for, in the words of St. Gregory,
“what does not he see, who sees Him Who sees all things?”</p>

<p>Such was the sublime teaching which St. Bernard and the contemplatives
of his time opposed to the growing spirit of philosophic
rationalism. The Cistercian cloisters and the disciples of the school
of St. Victor everywhere propagated the same spiritual maxims, and
thus provided a wholesome antidote to the baneful spirit of the age.
But the very existence of the antidote bears witness how wide-spread
was the poison which it sought to nullify, how greatly the mind of
Christendom had broken away from the old landmarks of thought,
and how rapidly it was sweeping onward to what threatened to cause
the wreck of faith and philosophy together.</p>

<p>The actual state of the schools at the middle of the twelfth century
may best be gathered from the description given by our own country
man, John of Salisbury, of his own course of studies. He appears to
have come to Paris for the first time in 1136, being then a youth of
sixteen, and, like thousands of the same age, was launched into the
world of the great capital, to complete his education under the many
wise professors who were contending for popular favour. Here
we catch a glimpse of the new system which was gradually establishing
itself. Education was no longer given exclusively in cloistered
schools, but in great cities, where the young aspirant after science,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
instead of being sheltered under law and discipline, was cast abroad
to shift for himself, and only required to attend the lectures of some
licensed master. No doubt it was an excellent way of teaching him
a knowledge of the world, but this had not hitherto been included in
the branches of a noble youth’s early education. However, at sixteen
John had to take care of himself in the great world of Paris, which
exercised over him the fascination of which all were conscious who
passed from the semi-barbarous isle of Britain to the brilliant capital,
and beheld the gay vivacity of its citizens, the gravity of its religious
ceremonials, the splendour and majesty of its many churches, and the
busy life of its schools.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> “Happy banishment,” wrote the young
scholar, “that is permitted here to find a home!” His first care was
to choose what Professor he would attend. It was just the time
when Abelard’s fame was at its greatest height, and the English youth
was naturally enough led to join the crowds that thronged the school
of St. Geneviève. His first impression was one of delight, but soon
his English good sense revolted at the shallowness which he detected
under the showy outside, while the contemptuous neglect with which
Abelard was wont to treat the ancient learning, was unendurable in
the eyes of one who, young as he was, already had a thoroughly-formed
taste for the classics. So bidding adieu to St. Geneviève, he
placed himself under the two English masters, Robert de Mélun and
William de Conches; by the first of whom he was initiated into the art
of logic. He praises the disinterestedness shown by Robert, who, in
his conduct as Professor, despised worldly gain and sought only the
benefit of his scholars. Robert afterwards became Bishop of Hereford,
and in that capacity acquired a very unenviable notoriety as one of
the chief opponents of St. Thomas of Canterbury. Under William
de Conches, John next passed three years with very great profit,
studying grammar, which was then understood to include the explanation
of good authors. He never regretted the time he devoted to
this study. William was a disciple of the old school, a stout champion
of the liberal arts, and warmly opposed to the new system introduced
by Abelard. He liked to exercise his pupils in prose and verse, and
required not only good prosody, but also good sense from his scholars.
It was doubtless a fine thing to hear the warm-hearted, testy Englishman
speak of the schools in which he had been brought up half a century
ago, when boys were taught to behave like boys, and to listen to
their masters in silence. Things were much altered now; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
no longer the custom to follow the wholesome rule which Pythagoras
taught his disciples, namely, to listen in silence for seven years, and
only begin to ask questions in the eighth. On the contrary, these
new scholars would come into your school with a supercilious air,
and propose you their doubts and quibbles before they were well
seated. They seemed to fancy that they knew everything when they
had followed the schools for a year, and as if their business was to
instruct their masters by their amazingly clever questions. On all
these abuses Master William was wont to expend his honest indignation,
but he certainly could not complain that John of Salisbury
exhibited any of these marks of reprobation. Far from seeming to
think he knew everything after a year’s study, John, after spending
twelve years in the schools, regarded himself as still a learner. After
his three years of grammar, he spent seven years more in successive
courses of rhetoric, mathematics, and theology. Among the masters
whose lectures he attended were Robert Pullus, or Pulleyne, and
Gilbert de la Poiree. The latter afterwards became Bishop of Poitiers,
in which dignity he was accused of teaching certain heterodox
opinions on the Holy Trinity, which were condemned at the Council
of Rheims, in 1148. His errors, like those of Abelard, appear to
have arisen out of an abuse of that scholastic method of argumentation
so popular among the professors of the time, and which too
often proved dangerous weapons in the hands of men whose theological
studies by no means kept pace with the cultivation of dialectics.
Robert Pullus, the English master of theology, and restorer of sacred
studies at Oxford, was a man of far more solid learning. “He knew,”
says his great disciple, “how to be wise with sobriety.” The soundness
of his doctrine was evinced by his “Sum of Theology,” and his
disinterestedness, by his refusal of a bishopric offered him by Henry
I. Robert declined abandoning a life of study for the precarious
honours of a dignity which exposed its owner to the almost certain
contingency of a struggle with the crown. He desired nothing more
honourable than the life of a master; nevertheless, he was unable to
avoid the dignities thrust on him by Celestine II., who created him
cardinal and chancellor of the Roman Church.</p>

<p>During the whole time of his residence at Paris, John of Salisbury
enjoyed a scholar’s honourable state of poverty, and supported himself
by giving lessons to younger students, much after the fashion of
a modern college tutor. His tutorship was, however, by no means
a very profitable post, and supplied him with little beyond the bare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
necessaries of life. Happily, however, the threadbare gown of the
poor scholar was still regarded with respect, and his humble circumstances
did not prevent him from forming many valuable friendships.
Among his friends he numbered the two great masters Adam du
Petit Pont, and Richard l’Évêque, the former of whom he describes
as a man of undoubted learning, but so vain that he wrapped up his
knowledge in a cloud of obscurity, and made himself unintelligible
for the sake of appearing profound, saying to those who reproached
him with this weakness, that were he only to teach in the common
way, he should get no one to attend his lectures. Richard was a man
of a very different temper; his pride lay rather in concealing what he
knew, than in displaying it; he cared nothing at all for worldly
applause, and was deemed as holy in life as he was erudite. At first
he followed the excellent method of Bernard of Chartres, but by
degrees he yielded to the fashion of the times, and giving up the
teaching of grammar and rhetoric, confined himself entirely to
lecturing on dialectics.</p>

<p>To these friends of John of Salisbury we must add the name of
a third, an Englishman like himself, and one of Anglo-Saxon blood.
He was a young law-student, who, if inferior to many of his companions
in scholastic acquirements, made up for the deficiency by
the brilliancy of his native gifts, and those personal graces which add
so largely to the power of wit or eloquence. The large grey eyes,
thin aquiline nose, and beautiful countenance, so calm, yet with a
glance so full of fire, are all known to us; for if the features of St.
Thomas à Becket have not been preserved chiselled in marble, they
have yet been made familiar to us by the description of those who
laid up in their hearts the memory of that beloved countenance. It
bore the unmistakable impress of genius, and of that sensitive
organisation with which genius is so frequently accompanied. But
his great natural gifts had received very imperfect culture in the
schools of Merton and those of the English metropolis. At Paris
his studies were almost exclusively confined to law, and he afterwards
regretted that he had not devoted more time during his academic
career to sacred learning. The intimacy which sprang up between
him and John of Salisbury was not, therefore, based on any similarity
in their literary tastes. The letters of both evince a striking difference
in their intellectual training; those of St. Thomas, powerful
in matter, are yet abrupt, harsh, and technical in style&mdash;those of his
friend, on the other hand, are conveyed in classic phraseology, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
betray the careful polish, not always free from affectation, of one who
has laboriously formed himself on ancient models. In fact, John of
Salisbury was, beyond dispute, the first scholar of his day, and
naturally enough bewailed the revolution which he witnessed taking
place in the schools. The science of reasoning was now affirmed
by its advocates to contain the pith of all philosophy. Rhetoric
was regarded by them as altogether unnecessary, because eloquence
being a gift of nature, could not be acquired by art. Those who
possessed the gift needed no study of ancient authors to infuse it
into them; and those who did not possess it, would study them to
no purpose. The art of logic to such men was all in all, and such
was the eagerness with which they indulged their taste for disputation,
that some spent their whole days in argument, and carried on their
tiresome wrangling in the very streets. And what arguments they
were! They examined seriously and at alarming length the weighty
question, whether a pig who is driven by a man to be sold at the
market, is held by the man, or by the cord fastened round his leg;
and whether one who buys a cloak can be held to have purchased
also the hood fastened to the cloak. As two negatives are equal to
one affirmative, professors were accustomed to introduce into their
arguments such a number of negatives, that in order to reckon them
up, and see in what sense their propositions were to be understood,
the hearers had recourse to the device of dropping a bean at each
negative, and reckoning up the sum total at the end of the lecture.
John, in his writings, complains of all these extravagancies, and of
the tiresome way in which these choppers of logic would dispute
over a tuft of wool, and instantly contradict any man who opened
his lips in their presence. Nor did he cease lamenting over the
neglect of good literature, which was resulting from the predominance
given in the schools to logical disputation. He specially attacks one
of the leading scholastics whom he does not name, but speaks of him
under the sobriquet of “<em>Cornificius</em>;”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and those who showed
themselves hostile to the claims of grammar and rhetoric are
denominated by him “<em>Cornificians</em>.” In spite of all his wit and
eloquence, the Cornificians won the day. The study of polite
literature fell into neglect, and the intellectual power of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries was turned into another channel&mdash;a channel
which no doubt gave rise to a good deal of barbarous Latinity, but
whence was to issue, in process of time, something more precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
than mere literary elegance, the scholastic philosophy of the
Church.</p>

<p>The caustic strictures of John of Salisbury were not directed
against that system of philosophy, which as yet had no existence,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
but against the error which put forth the exercise of sophistical
argumentation as itself the sum of all philosophy, and the danger
which he saw too well must arise from the deification of human
reason. For the scholastic method, to which the theology of the
Church stands so deeply indebted, is not to be confounded with the
scholasticism which was rampant in the days of Abelard. The errors
and sophistries of the professors of his day, arising as they did out
of an extravagant adherence to the uncorrected teaching of Aristotle,
were from the first discerned and condemned by the ecclesiastical
authorities; and by none were they more firmly opposed than by
St. Bernard, who saw to what fatal results the unrestrained culture
of human reason, under the guidance of a pagan master, must
necessarily lead. We shall see further on how jealously the Church
continued to regard the study of Aristotle, and in what way she
sought to check the evils flowing from it to the schools, up to the
time when his philosophy was finally adapted to the service of the
faith by the labours of St. Thomas.</p>

<p>In the midst of his studies, his tutorships, and his passages of arms
with the Cornificians, twelve years slipped away, at the end of which
time John of Salisbury found himself possessed of a vast fund of
erudition<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and an empty purse. The latter circumstance was not
one which greatly disquieted him, for his theory was that the keys
which opened the door of philosophy were not of gold, but consisted
of poverty, humility, silence, and a quiet life, together with that
detachment from family and worldly ties which is best found in a
foreign land.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> So little had he of the spirit of worldly ambition,
that when in 1148 Peter des Celles, abbot of Moutier des Celles,
offered him a chaplaincy in his monastery, he gladly accepted a post,
which, however humble, gave him at least the leisure and the means
to study. He remained in this retreat for the space of three years.
Peter des Celles was one of the most remarkable men of his time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
and has made himself best known by his epistles; for, like most of
the literary personages of the twelfth century, he was a great letter
writer. He had received his education in the monastic school of
St. Martin des Champs, and does not seem to have been one whit
behind the more fashionable students of Paris. “I had,” he writes,
“an insatiable appetite for learning; my eyes were never tired of
beholding books, or my ears of listening to them; yet with all my
ardour, God was always the beginning, centre, and end of all my
studies. They had but Him for their object, though indeed I studied
everything, even law, without prejudice, however, to the duties of
my state, attendance on the Divine Office, and my accustomed
prayers.” This worthy inheritor of the genuine monastic spirit acted
the part of a true father to our English scholar, who at last, through
the favour of St. Bernard, obtained the post of secretary to Theobald,
Archbishop of Canterbury, in whose household he renewed his
acquaintance with two of his former fellow-students, Peter de Blois,
and Thomas à Becket. Peter de Blois had been one of his pupils;
a man of versatile talent, who had studied first at Tours, then at
Paris, and lastly at Bologna, and had seen something of half the
courts of Europe. He was equally skilled in law, medicine, and
theology, but it is by his epistles that he is chiefly known, and his
ready and somewhat gossiping pen has left us graphic sketches of
the manners and customs of his time. He was, in fact, the Horace
Walpole of the twelfth century, curious, fluent, and volatile. Henry
II. made him archdeacon, first of Bath, and then of London, and
often employed him as secretary, so that he had excellent opportunities
for studying the court of our first Plantagenet sovereign,
which he describes in a sufficiently amusing manner. He assures
us that Henry’s court, from the conversation of learned men and the
discussion of questions, was a daily school. The king, he says, is
deeply versed in literature, and has more gifts of mind and body than
he can so much as enumerate; nevertheless, he lets out the ugly
fact that it is best not to go too near him when he is out of humour,
as he is then more of a lion than a lamb, and is quite as likely as not
to tear out your eyes. How any man of letters can ever attach himself
to a court life is more than he can understand; and how any
man, lettered or unlettered, could be brought to endure the daily
miseries he describes, such as the eating of “mouldy bread and stale
fish, wine that can only be drunk with the eyes shut, lodgings for
which pigs would be ashamed to quarrel,” and days spent “without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
order, plan, or moderation of any kind,” must seem equally incomprehensible
to his readers. But he has something more cheering to
say of the household of Archbishop Theobald. It is crowded with
learned men, who spend their time between prayers and dinner in
lecturing, disputing, and examining causes. All the knotty questions
of the kingdom are referred to them, and discussed in the common
hall; and there is no sort of jealousy or contention, but the youngest
present is listened to with courtesy and attention. In these letters
Peter de Blois has a good deal to say On the subject of education.
He tells us that in his youth he was trained, not in idle fables, but
solid literature, and names Livy, Quintius Curtius, Tacitus, Suetonius,
and Josephus among the books then most commonly used in schools.
He regards the new scholasticism with undisguised contempt: it is
good, he says, neither at home nor abroad, neither in the church,
the cloister, the camp, the court, or the bar. In fact, in his literary
tastes he showed himself a worthy disciple of John of Salisbury.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the latter attached himself to the rising fortunes of St.
Thomas, and dedicated to him, when chancellor, his two great
works, the <cite>Polycraticon</cite> and the <cite>Metalogicon</cite>, the last of which is a
formal apology for humane letters, and is considered to display an
amount of learning and literary elegance far exceeding anything
which had been produced since the days of Boëthius. When St.
Thomas became primate, his friend continued to retain the office he
had held under his predecessor, and never spared the archbishop
the benefit of his frank and fearless advice. Among other things,
he took on him to give him some directions with regard to his
studies which are worth quoting, as showing the view taken at that
time by spiritual men, of the danger resulting from an excessive
application to law and logic. “My counsel is,” he says, “that you
put off some of your other occupations, in order to give your whole
mind to prayer. Laws and canons are all very well, but believe me,
they nourish curiosity more than devotion.... Who ever rose from
the study of law with a sentiment of compunction in his heart?
Nay, I will say more, the exercises of the schools often increase
knowledge till a man is puffed up with it, but they rarely inflame
devotion. I would far rather that you meditated on the Psalms or
read the ‘Morals of St. Gregory,’ than that you were learned in
philosophy, after the fashion of the scholastics.” St. Thomas was
not slow in taking his friend’s advice, and both at Canterbury and
Pontigny often spent whole nights in the study of the Scriptures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
and was wont always to carry a few pages in the loose sleeve of his
tunic, that he might have them at hand whenever he found a leisure
moment for reading.</p>

<p>We need not pursue further the history of John of Salisbury.
The fidelity with which he adhered to the cause of St. Thomas
exposed him to no small loss and personal danger, and after the
martyrdom of the saint he had to fly from England, and taking
refuge in France, became Bishop of Chartres in 1176, his election
being entirely due to his personal merits, and the honour with which
the French clergy regarded one who had been the companion of the
Blessed Martyr. But before concluding our notice of the Parisian
masters, it remains for us to name the three Peters, as they are
called, who all illustrated the schools about the same period. The
first was Peter Comestor, or the Eater&mdash;so called from his habit of
devouring books&mdash;a very famous personage in his day, who became
chancellor of Paris in 1164, but resigned all his dignities to put on
the habit of the canons of St. Victor’s. His <cite>Historia Scholastica</cite>, or
Epitome of Sacred History, was so much esteemed in the twelfth
century, that portions of it were read in the churches. A namesake
of his, called Peter the Chanter, was almost of equal fame. He
too, after filling the eye of the public for several years, withdrew
from their applause, and became a simple religious in the Abbey of
Long-Pont, where he died in 1197.</p>

<p>Both were men of tried virtue, and showed themselves hostile to
the sophists of the day, whose wranglings they declared to be
opposed to the simplicity of the Gospel. But more renowned than
either was the Italian scholar, Peter Lombard, the Master of the
Sentences, as he was called, and the real Father and founder of
scholastic theology. He commenced his study of civil law at
Bologna, and thence passed on to Paris, where he was admitted
among the canons of St. Victor’s, and afterwards taught for some
years in the cathedral school. In 1159 he became bishop of Paris,
through the influence of his royal pupil, prince Philip, brother to the
reigning king, Louis the Young. The king offered the bishopric to
his brother, who was educated for the ecclesiastical state, but he
nobly refused it in favour of his master. Peter Lombard’s great
work was the celebrated Book of Sentences, consisting of a number
of passages selected from the works of the fathers, and commented
on in such a manner as to present the student with a body of
theological doctrines systematically arranged. The convenience of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
finding every point of theology treated of in a precise and methodical
order, and within the compass of a single volume, was speedily
recognised, and the Book of the Sentences soon became the favourite
text-book used in the schools, both for the lectures of the masters
and the private study of their disciples. Hence the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sententiarus</i>,
which came to be applied to those who taught or studied the
Sentences. Notwithstanding the immense popularity obtained by
this work, it is said to contain several important omissions, and
even some theological errors, one of which was formerly condemned
by Pope Alexander III. Its importance is derived from the circumstance
of its being the first attempt to reduce theology to a compact
and orderly scientific system; and from this period we date the real
rise of the science of scholastic theology.</p>

<p>It will have been observed that in what has been said up to this
time of the schools of Paris, they have not been designated by the
title of a university. For, in fact, as yet these schools had no claim
to be regarded as a corporate body; they were accidents rather than
an institution, and it was only gradually that they acquired a corporate
character, and became possessed of a government, a head,
and a body of laws and privileges. This change was effected by no
sudden act of royal or ecclesiastical legislation; it developed itself
insensibly but of the very necessity of the case. The immense
number of masters and pupils who flocked to the capital, gave rise
to disorders, which obliged the superiors of the different schools to
unite together and agree to certain rules of common discipline.</p>

<p>Thus in 1195 we find a certain John, abbot of St. Albans, associated
to the “body of elect masters.” Some years before, in the
very thick of the quarrel between Henry II. and St. Thomas, occurs
the first notice of that division of the scholars into <em>nations</em> or provinces,
which formed one of the peculiarities of the university.
Henry offered to choose as arbiters either the peers of France, the
French clergy, or the heads of the different <em>provinces</em> in the school
of Paris. We find also certain laws, or at least established customs
having the force of laws, respecting the method to be observed in
granting licenses for the opening of a school. It was the rule in all
dioceses that no one could open a school without permission from
the cathedral scholasticus, or chancellor of the diocese, who was
bound to grant such licenses to all who were capable. Pope
Alexander III., who showed a lively interest in everything that concerned
the encouragement of education, ordered that such licenses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
should be granted gratuitously, but he afterwards permitted the
Chancellor of Paris, who was at that time Peter Comestor, to exact
a certain fine. It appears, also, that in Paris the chancellor or
scholasticus of St. Geneviève shared this right with the chancellor of
Notre Dame. There were also other laws, such as those which
prohibited religious from teaching or studying in the schools of law
or medicine. The two faculties, as they were called, of arts and
theology, which formed the basis of the university, appear to have
been already distinguished. Certain privileges, too, were already
enjoyed by the students. They were beginning to claim the right
of being tried only by the ecclesiastical tribunals, and this right was
granted to them in 1194 by a decree of Celestine III. Alexander
III. permitted clerics to retain their benefices whilst teaching or
studying at Paris. Finally, in the year 1200, we find the existence
of the university as a corporate body, governed by a head, acknowledged
in the diploma of Philip Augustus, wherein, having confirmed
the exemption of the scholars from the secular courts, he
decreed that the head of the studies should, in particular, be
incapable of arrest or punishment from the secular judge, and
obliged every provost of the city on his entrance into office to swear
to the observance of this decree.</p>

<p>From this time, therefore, we may properly date the formal recognition
of the university of Paris, and passing over the obscurities in
which its earlier commencements are involved, shall proceed to
present our readers with a sketch of that institution as it existed in
the palmy days of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class="pfs90">PARIS AND THE FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1150 TO 1250.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> modern visitor to Paris who finds his way to that portion of the
city lying on the southern bank of the river, which still bears the
name of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quartier de l’Université</i>, sees himself surrounded by
buildings, many of which bear unmistakably the character of their
original destination. He stands, in fact, amid the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of the old
university of Paris, the schools and colleges of which were clustered
for the most part about the Mont St. Geneviève, and occupied an
entire suburb, which was first enclosed within the city walls by
Philip Augustus. That monarch, passionately desirous to increase the
splendour of his capital, and at the same time to afford larger space
for the accommodation of the crowds of students, whose numbers are
said to have exceeded those of the citizens themselves, added a large
district, which in the year 1200 presented a fair expanse of fields
and vineyards, interspersed with churches, houses, and farms, but
in which you would vainly have sought for any of those magnificent
and semi-monastic structures which we are accustomed to associate
with the idea of a university. Colleges, in fact, had as yet no
existence at Paris, and the university consisted of an assemblage,
not of stately buildings, but of masters and scholars gathered out of
every European land.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to convey an idea of the enthusiasm with
which the Paris schools were regarded at the beginning of the
thirteenth century. No one, whatever might be his country, could
pretend to any consideration who had not studied there in his
youth; if you met a priest or doctor, whose skill in letters you
desired to praise, it was enough to say, “one would think he had
passed his whole life in Paris.” It was, to use the expression of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
Gregory IX., the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cariath-sepher</i>, or city of letters,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> which drew to
itself the intellectual wealth of Christendom. “Whatever a nation
has that is most precious,” writes William of Brittany, the chaplain
of Philip Augustus, in his poem of the <cite>Philipide</cite>, “whatever a
people has most famous, all the treasures of science and all the
riches of the earth; lessons of wisdom, the glory of letters, nobility
of thought, refinement of manners, all this is to be found in Paris.”
Others declared, in yet more pompous language, that neither Egypt
nor Athens could be compared to the modern capital, which was,
they said, the very fountain-head of wisdom, the tree of life in the
midst of the terrestrial paradise, the torch of the house of the Lord.
The exile who had once tasted of its delights no longer regretted his
banishment from his own land; and, in truth, the beauty of the city,
its light elastic atmosphere, the grace and gaiety of its inhabitants, and
the society of all that was most choice in wit and learning, rendered
it no less fascinating a residence in the thirteenth century as the capital
of learning than it has since become as the metropolis of fashion.</p>

<p>To these attractions were added the advantages which the Parisian
students enjoyed in virtue of their privileges. I have already spoken
of the diploma granted by Philip Augustus, and its provisions were
greatly enlarged by subsequent monarchs. Philip le Bel ordered
that the goods of students should never be seized for debt, and they
were also exempt from taxes. If a French scholar travelled, all
farmers were obliged to supply him with horses at a reasonable rate
of hire. Artisans were not allowed to annoy him with unpleasant
odours or noises, and on complaint being made of such nuisances,
they had to remove themselves out of his neighbourhood. The
rights of citizenship were likewise enjoyed by the members of all
the French universities, and in those days this involved many
important exemptions. Scholarship was, in short, regarded as an
honourable profession, something which almost conferred on its
possessor a patent of nobility; the new master of arts had lighted
flambeaux carried before him in the public streets, and the conferring
of a doctor’s degree was an event which caused as much stir as the
dubbing of a knight. Nay, in those days, so permeated with the
romantic spirit of chivalry, scholars were not unfrequently spoken of
as “the knights of science,” and the disputation at which some
youthful aspirant contended for the doctor’s cap was regarded as the
intellectual tournament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>Yet, there was another side to this brilliant picture, and one plainly
discerned by those whose calmer judgment would not suffer itself to
be deceived as to the perils which awaited so many young and
ardent minds, exposed without restraint or guidance to the manifold
temptations, both moral and intellectual, that awaited them in that
busy throng. “O Paris!” exclaims Peter of the Cells, in a letter
to one of his monks who had been sent thither to study, “resort of
every vice, source of every disorder, thou dart of hell; how dost
thou pierce the heart of the unwary!” John, the young monk
whom he addresses, had, it would seem, deplored the new scenes
amid which he found himself as painfully out of harmony with his
monastic training. “Who but yourself,” replies the abbot, “would
not reckon this Paris to be a very Eden, a land of first-fruits and
flowers? Yet you have spoken truly, though in jest, for the place
which is richest in bodily pleasures miserably enslaves the soul. So,
at least, thinks my John, and rightly therefore does he call it a place
of exile. May you always so esteem it, and hasten home to your
true country, where in the book of life you will find, not figures and
elements, but Divinity and Truth itself. O happy school of Christ!
where He teaches our heart with the word of power, where the book
is not purchased nor the Master paid. There life avails more than
learning, and simplicity than science. There none are refuted save
those who are for ever rejected; and one word of final judgment,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ite</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venite</i>, decides all questions and all cavils for ever. Would
that men would apply themselves to these studies rather than to so
many vain discourses; they would find more abundant fruit and
more availing honour.”</p>

<p>In these words we see the distrust with which the representatives
of the old learning regarded the rising university system, contrasting
as it did so strangely with the claustral discipline in which they had
themselves been reared. Nor can it be denied that the fair outside
of the great city concealed a monstrous mass of deformity. James
de Vitry, who had himself been a student, gives a frightful picture of
the vices which were fostered in a society drawn from every rank
and every country, and associated together without moral discipline
of any kind, at an age when the passions were least subject to
restraint. The very sense of moral rectitude, he says, seems to have
been lost. A profuse extravagance was encouraged by the example
of the more wealthy students, and those who lived frugally, or
practised piety, were ridiculed as misers and hypocrites. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
at that time no provision for the accommodation of the students in
halls or hospices; they lodged in the houses of the citizens wherever
they could secure the cheapest entertainment. Not unfrequently the
very schools of the masters were held in the upper story of some
house, the groundfloor of which was the resort of the most abandoned
characters.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> There was no common table; but the students
dined at taverns where they often associated with the worst companions,
and indulged in the lowest excesses, and the jealousy
between “town and gown” continually broke out in disgraceful
quarrels, terminating not unfrequently in bloodshed. As most of
those engaged in these affrays were clerics, and as the striking of a
cleric brought on the guilty party the sentence of excommunication,
the results of these disorders were exceedingly grave. It became
necessary to grant extraordinary powers to the university officers,
and to prohibit the scholars from bearing arms, a prohibition
grounded on the atrocious crimes with which they stood charged;
and which at one time threatened to bring about the total extinction
of the university. For the magistrates having proceeded to revenge
a certain riot which had arisen out of a tavern quarrel, by ill-judged
acts of severity, both masters and scholars resolved to abandon the
city; nor did they return till the wise and timely interference of
Pope Gregory IX. brought about a reconciliation between the civil
and academic authorities.</p>

<p>The university, in fact, presented the spectacle, at that time new
in Christendom, of a system of education which aimed at informing
the intellect without disciplining the soul. Its work was done in the
lecture room, where alone the master exercised any authority, and
the only tie existing between him and his disciples was the salary
paid by one party and received by the other. In addition to the
dangers incident to this state of uncontrolled liberty, were the more
subtle temptations to pride and presumption which beset a man in
the schools. Mere youths were sometimes seen promoted to the
professor’s chair, and seeking to win a passing popularity by the
promulgation of some new extravagance, an abuse which led to the
passing of an ordinance forbidding any one to teach Theology
before he had attained the age of twenty-five. But the teaching of
the professors was influenced by other peculiarities in their position.
“The university doctors,” says Fleury, “were doctors, and they were
nothing more. Exclusively engaged with theoretic views, they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
leisure to write at great length on the most frivolous questions; and
plentiful occasions were thus ministered of quarrel and dispute.”
And he proceeds to notice the contrast between such a system and
that of earlier ages, when the teachers of the Church were for the
most part bishops, engaged in the duties of their pastoral charge,
and able to support their doctrines with the weight of practical
experience. The character of the new professors is drawn severely
enough in the curious poem of Architrenius,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> which was written
towards the close of the twelfth century by John de Hauteville, an
English monk of St. Albans. Architrenius, the hero, is supposed to
travel through the world, trying various states and conditions, and
finding vanity and emptiness in all of them; at last he comes to
Paris, and devotes a whole book to describing the vanity of the
masters, and the miseries of their disciples. He depicts the negligent
and squalid appearance of the poor scholars, their ragged dress,
uncombed hair, bad lodging and hard beds. After spending half
the night in study, he says, they are roused at daybreak and forced
to hurry to the school, where the master treats them rudely, and
where they have to endure the mortification of seeing others of less
merit rewarded, and themselves passed over with neglect. He goes
on to describe the hill of presumption which he peoples with doctors
and scholastics, gifted with far less learning than conceit, and concludes,
that the schools are as full of vanity and disappointment as
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the poor scholars, which Architrenius so graphically
describes, were destined, however, to bring about a most
beneficial change in the university system, by being the chief occasion
of the foundation of hospices and colleges, the multiplication
of which, and their organisation under regular discipline, in time
applied a remedy to the worst of the existing evils. From a very
early date, the relief and support of poor scholars had been recognised
as a meritorious work of charity; it formed one of the favourite
devotions of the two kings, Robert the Pious and Lewis the Young, the
former of whom attempted something in the shape of a hospital to
receive them. How miserable their condition was, we may gather
from the benefaction of the good knight Jocius de Londonne, who,
returning from the Holy Land in 1171, found some poor scholars
miserably lodged in the Hôtel-Dieu, and gave money to provide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
them with beds, and a small monthly alms, on condition of their
carrying the Cross and Holy-water at the funeral of those who died
in the hospital, and repeating the Penitential Psalms for the repose
of their souls. The earliest establishment actually made for their
reception appears to have been the Hospice of St. Thomas of
Canterbury, founded in the twelfth century by Robert Dreux. It
embraced a number of other charitable works, and was administered
by canons who were under religious vows, the scholars being
governed by a provost of their own. Other colleges gradually arose,
some for scholars of particular nations, as those of the Danes and
Swedes; others for separate dioceses. One of the earliest foundations
was the College of Constantinople, founded by Baldwin of
Flanders, shortly after the taking of Constantinople by the Latins,
for the education of young Greeks in the orthodox faith. Chapels
were opened in connection with these colleges so early as 1248, in
which year we find Pope Innocent IV. granting permission for such
a chapel to be attached to the college <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Bons Enfants</i>. But the
collegiate system became more thoroughly established by the influence
of the Religious Orders, who very soon found themselves
obliged to open religious houses in connection with the university,
for the education of their own students. These houses of studies
afforded the young religious the regular discipline of the old
monastic schools, combined with the advantages of university education;
and their example made it a necessity to provide similar protection
for the secular students.</p>

<p>The Trinitarian Order, founded by one of the most illustrious of
the Parisian doctors, and largely recruited from the ranks of his co-professors,
was naturally the first to associate itself to the university,
out of whose bosom it had sprung; and so early as the year 1209,
we find the friars in possession of the Church of St. Maturin, which
was ordinarily used by the university as their place of assembly.
Next to them came the Dominicans and Franciscans, the former of
whom owed their establishment in Paris to the good will of the
university authorities, who made over to them certain claims they
possessed on the Hospital of St. James, which had been granted to
the new comers by the good doctor, John of St. Quentin. A little
later, the College of the Bernardines was founded by Stephen of
Lexington, an Englishman who had been a pupil of St. Edmund,
and who in 1242 became abbot of Clairvaux. Strictly contemplative as
was the rule of the Cistercians, it did not exclude the cultivation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
sacred studies. It aimed rather at restoring monastic life to the
ancient Benedictine type, in which, as we have seen, the homely
labours of husbandry were mingled with those of the scriptorium.
The Cistercians, whilst they laboured to bring back religious poverty
and simplicity into the cloister, always showed themselves hearty
encouragers of learning. St. Stephen Harding had himself set on
foot that great copy of the Bible, long preserved at Citeaux, which
was corrected with the utmost precision after being collated with a
vast number of manuscripts, several learned Jews being consulted by
the abbot on the Hebrew text. To procure a correct version of the
Gregorian Antiphonary, he sent all the way to Metz, trusting to
obtain a sight of the copy laid up there by Charlemagne. The
library at Citeaux was rich in the works of the Fathers, though the
outside of the books exhibited nothing of that costly ornament on
which the skill of monastic binders and jewellers was elsewhere
expended. The early Cistercians were connected very closely with
some of the best Paris scholars, such as William of Champeaux, the
friend of St. Stephen, and after his elevation to the episcopate, the
diocesan of St Bernard. In England their ranks had been largely
recruited from the University of Oxford, and their monastery of
Rievaux was famous at home and abroad for its school of learning.
Stephen of Lexington was not, therefore, departing from the traditions
of his order in considering that the maintenance of sacred
studies was a necessity of the times. Two years after his election he
obtained permission from Pope Innocent IV. to begin the erection
of a college at Paris for the young monks of his order; but the proposal
was very unfavourably received by the other Benedictine houses
who saw in it the break-up of the old monastic system of studies.
The conservative spirit which was roused among them is discernible
in the complaints of Matthew Paris, who laments over the contempt
with which a proud world is beginning to regard the old Benedictine
monks. “This new institution of colleges,” he says, “is not, that we
can see, derived from the rule of St. Benedict; on the contrary, we
read that <em>he</em> quitted the schools to retire into the desert.”</p>

<p>Stephen, however, persevered in his design; he was aware that the
contempt with which the monks were so frequently treated, both by
the secular doctors and the new orders of friars, was grounded on
the charge of their illiteracy, and he therefore believed it essential to
provide his monks with better means of education than, under the
altered state of things, they were now able to command in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
claustral schools. His design was crowned with perfect success.
Not only did the College of the Bernardines become illustrious for
its good scholarship, but the conduct of its religious shed a good
odour of edification over the whole university, and ten years after
its foundation, Matthew Paris himself bore honourable witness to the
holy example of the monks, which, he said, “gave pleasure to God
and man.” For Stephen there was reserved the reward of disgrace
and humiliation. The Chapter-General of Citeaux deposed him
from his office in 1255, instigated, says Matthew Paris, by envy
for the superior merits of an Englishman. Whatever were the
cause of his disgrace, it gave him an opportunity of proving that his
adoption of what had seemed an innovation on established customs,
sprang out of no defect in the religious spirit. He refused to accept
of the protection offered him by the Pope, in favour of which he
might have been reinstated in his dignity, and preferred spending the
rest of his days as a private religious, entirely occupied with his
own sanctification.</p>

<p>The example of the Bernardines was quickly followed by other
religious orders. The Carmelites took up their station at the foot of
Mt. St. Geneviève, the Augustinians in the Quartier Montmartre.
The old Benedictines, or Black Monks, had their college near the
abbey of St. Germain, and the Carthusians received from St. Louis
a grant of the royal Chateau de Vauverd. The monks of the latter
order were indeed prohibited by their rule from attending in the
schools, but the object of their establishment so near the capital is
expressly stated to have been, that they might profit by the salutary
streams of doctrine which flowed forth from the city of letters.
To these must be added the monks of Cluny and Marmoutier, the
former of whom provided their students with lecturers within
their own cloisters; and a new Institute originally founded by four
doctors of theology, who in 1201 gave up their academic honours
and pursuits, and, smitten with that desire of poverty and obscurity
which not unfrequently overtakes men in the very zenith of their
popularity and success, retired to a wild valley in the diocese of
Langres, and assumed the religious habit of the Canons Regular of
St. Victor. Here they were soon joined by other professors and
scholars, till their numbers rendered it impossible for them to find
subsistence in the desolate wildness they had chosen, exposed to the
fury of the mountain torrents, and the falling of precipitous rocks.
They, therefore, removed in 1224 to a more fertile valley, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
obtained the name of the Val d’Ecoliers, a title afterwards bestowed
on the new order itself. Five years later they opened a house of
studies in Paris, and the Church of St. Catherine was built for them
at the charge of a certain knight, in fulfilment of a vow he had taken
at the battle of Bouvines, the young St. Louis laying the first stone
with his own hand.</p>

<p>The bishops were not slow to follow the example set them by the
monastics; and indeed they, more than others, felt the necessity of
providing in some way or other for the training of their clerks. It
was vain to think of competing with the university in the cathedral
schools; and, on the other hand, what was to be hoped from a
secular clergy, formed in no higher school of discipline than that
which James of Vitry has described? Colleges, therefore, where the
young clerics might be reared in ecclesiastical habits, were, strictly
speaking, essential; and, accordingly, we find them established for
the clergy of different dioceses, as those of Laon, Narbonne, and
Bayeux. In these the scholars lived in common, celebrated the
Divine Office, had appointed hours of study and recreation, and
were governed and watched over by regents. In fact, says Fleury,
“they were so many little seminaries;” differing in many respects,
and doubtless, far inferior to those old ecclesiastical schools which
had been established in the bishop’s house, wherein the young
clerks grew up under the eye, and were trained by the lips of their chief
pastor; yet still schools of discipline, the good results of which were
so apparent that, erelong, every country which followed the Latin
rite adopted the system which had begun in France and Italy. The
most famous of all the secular colleges was that of the Sorbonne, the
founder of which, Robert of Sorbonne, was chaplain to St. Louis.
Crevier calls it the greatest ornament of the university, and from
very humble beginnings it came at last to be regarded as the first
theological school in the Christian world. In it were afterwards
founded no fewer than seven Chairs of Theology; namely, those of
the Reader, of Contemplative, and Positive Theology, of the Holy
Scriptures, of Casuistry, of Controversial Divinity, and of the Interpretation
of the Hebrew Text.</p>

<p>Gradually, but surely, the university freed itself from the chaotic
disorder of its first beginnings, and assumed the form of a great
institution, governed by regular laws and invested with vast powers
and privileges. At the period of its complete development, it was
composed of seven companies; namely, the Faculties of Theology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
Law, and Medicine, and the four nations of France, Picardy, Normandy,
and England. These four nations together formed the
Faculty of Arts, but each had a separate vote in the affairs of the
university. The Rector was chosen by the nations out of the Faculty
of Arts, the other faculties being governed by their deans.</p>

<p>An immense benefit was conferred on the University by Innocent
III., who had himself studied at Paris at a time when the want of
discipline was most severely felt. He was the first to supply his
Alma Mater with a body of academic statutes; which were promulgated
in 1215 by his legate, Robert de Courçon, an Englishman by
birth, and a man of piety and learning. They embraced the whole
discipline of the schools, regulating the conditions on which everyone
was to be admitted to teach, the books that were to be read and
those that were prohibited. No one was to profess arts before the
age of twenty-one, or without having previously studied for six years
under some approved master. He must bear a good reputation, and
before commencing his lectures, was to undergo an examination
according to certain rules. The books he was to read were to be the
“Dialectics” and “Topics” of Aristotle, Priscian, and certain others,
the authors of which are not named, but which seem to have been
well-known popular treatises on philosophy, rhetoric, grammar, and
mathematics. The physics and metaphysics of Aristotle were forbidden,
together with the writings of certain heretics, such as Amauri
de Bene, who had drawn their errors from the teaching of the Greek
Philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>To teach Theology, the statutes required that a man should be at
least thirty-five years of age, and that he should have studied under
some approved master. We see here the germ of the system of
graduation, which was perfected before the close of the century.
The rule, as then established, was for a bachelor to begin by explaining
the Sentences in the school of some doctor for the space of a
year. At the end of that time he was presented to the Chancellor
of the Cathedral of Paris, and if, on examination, he was judged
worthy, he received a license and became licentiate, until he was
received as doctor, when he opened a school of his own, in which
he explained the Sentences for another year. At the end of that
time he was allowed to receive some bachelor under him. The
whole doctor’s course lasted three years; nor could any one take a
degree unless he had taught according to these regulations. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
supposed that before beginning his theological studies the doctor
must have passed through his course of arts, the various stages in
which were distinguished by the names of grammar, poetry, philosophy,
&amp;c., in each of which, according to the theory of the ancient
schools, a student had to study successively for an appointed time.
The plan was excellent, says Fleury, had its execution been possible;
but life was too short to allow of a man’s perfecting himself in every
known branch of learning before entering on his theological studies.
It implied that his whole life was to be spent in the schools; and,
indeed, no inconsiderable portion of it was so spent, as we have seen
in the case of John of Salisbury, whose academical career spread
itself over the space of twelve years. But, in estimating the exact
value of these statements, we must bear in mind that the university
course at this time began at a very early age, and included those
more elementary studies which occupy a schoolboy of our day for
several years before his matriculation.</p>

<p>The statutes of Paris University, first promulgated by Innocent
III., and enlarged under subsequent pontiffs, not only regulated all
matters of study and discipline, but provided for the preservation of
that religious element which must always find a place in any system
of education sanctioned by the Church. The Christian schools, as
we have seen, found their cradle in the monastic and episcopal seminaries,
in which, as a matter of course, religious exercises were intermingled
with intellectual ones, to a very large degree. The Catholic
universities, in their complete form, adapted this system to their own
needs, and required of their students daily attendance, not only in
the lecture rooms, but also in the church or the collegiate chapel.
The weekly “chapels” exacted from our Oxford and Cambridge
students are fragments of the old rules, which, at Paris as in the
English universities, required daily attendance at Mass and Vespers,
and, at certain times also, at the Office of the Dead; and appointed
public processions at different seasons of the year, and days when
the public studies were suspended in order to give more time for the
due celebration of feasts, and preparation for the reception of the
Sacraments. If any reader be disposed to think that these demands
on the time of the students must have proved an interruption to
their studies, the fact is at once, and readily, admitted. But it may
be suggested whether, in this interruption, there does not manifest
itself a grand principle on which the Church acts wherever there is
question of the exercise of the human intelligence. The problem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
she had to resolve was, not how to convey the greatest possible
amount of knowledge with the greatest possible saving of time; but
rather, how to provide that a certain amount of intellectual labour
should be gone through in such a way as not to interfere injuriously
with the spiritual well-being of the soul. In cases where the intellect
is brought into exercise and stimulated to extraordinary activity,
there is danger lest what is in itself a wholesome and necessary
exercise may become vitiated by a certain natural impetuosity, which
disposes a man to pour himself out into the occupation in which he
is engaged; an impetuosity which opens the door to the human
spirit, and which brings in along with it a host of bad company,
such as pride, envy, ambition, contention, and the like. If this be
allowed, study, instead of being an instrument of our sanctification,
degenerates into its enemy; and hence the object aimed at in the
Catholic system has ever been to supply checks and safeguards to
nature, and to sanctify intellectual labour by a large admixture of
prayer. Among the monastic students the regular duties of religious
life supplied these necessary checks, the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retinacula</i>,” as they were
called by Bede, who fully understood their value and importance;
and the Catholic universities, to a certain degree, imitated the
monastic system, by requiring fixed religious duties to be complied
with by their students, as a part of their academic course. Nor need
we suppose that these interruptions, so salutary in a spiritual sense,
were at all injurious in an intellectual point of view. The discipline
of the Church, by a beautiful harmony, provides for the well-being
of our nature, at the very time that she mortifies it. Her rules of
fasting and abstinence, when observed, often prove the best preservatives
of health; and, in the same way, her checks on study were not
always hindrances. The truest economy of time does not, obviously,
consist in cramming the twelve hours of the day with excessive work,
but in laying them out to the best advantage. It is possible to tax
the mental powers beyond their strength, in which case nature
revenges herself on those who violate her laws, and the mind itself
weakens under the pressure of excessive labour. Could we compare
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horarium</i> of an Oxford or Paris student of the thirteenth century,
with that of a modern Rugby schoolboy, and obtain an accurate
statistical table, showing the proportion of exhausted brains to be
found among an equal number of either class, it might appear that
the Church legislated even for the mental well-being of her children
when she interposed so often between them and their studies, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
requiring of them the fulfilment of solemn offices at stated
times.</p>

<p>Of course, besides the principle above alluded to, there was the
more manifest object of religious training, touching which I will
merely quote the words of a former Rector of the Paris University,
who wrote in anything but a religious age. “Religion,” says M.
Rollin, in his treatise on “Education,” “should be the object of all
our instructions; though not perpetually in our mouths, it should
always be in our minds. Whoever examines the ancient statutes of
the university which relate to masters and scholars, and takes notice
of the prayers, solemnities, public processions, festivals, and days set
apart for preparing for the Sacraments, may easily discover that the
intention of their pious Mother is to consecrate and sanctify the
studies of youth by religion, and that she would not carry them so
long in her bosom were it not with the view of regenerating them to
Jesus Christ. It is with this design that she requires that in every
class, besides their other exercises of piety, the scholars should daily
repeat certain sentences from Holy Scripture, and especially from
the Gospels, that their other studies may be, as it were, seasoned
with salt.” And he quotes passages from the ancient statutes,
requiring that “the Divine Word be mingled with the eloquence of
the pagans, as is fitting in Christian schools where Christ, the One
Teacher of man, should not only be present, but preside.”</p>

<p>The very slight mention made in the statutes of Robert de
Courçon of Rhetoric, as included in the course of arts, is the last
which we shall meet with for a considerable space of time. The
Bull of Gregory IX., published in 1231, and the statutes of the
Regents of Arts, which appeared in 1254, make no reference to this
study. The arts are there represented by philosophy alone, and
there is no allusion to the cultivation of rhetoric, or the reading of
the classical authors, which from this date became very generally
neglected. As a natural consequence, grammar also lamentably
decayed. It was, of course, not absolutely banished, inasmuch as a
certain amount of it was essential for the pursuit of any studies at
all; but it became altogether barbarised and debased. Those rules
of syntax and prosody, over which the old monastic masters had so
lovingly lingered, were totally neglected, and although Latin poems
were still produced, their Latinity was full of false quantities and
grammatical solecisms. The tenth century, with all its darkness,
knew far more of humane letters than the thirteenth; nor was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
superiority of the earlier schools confined to a knowledge of the
classics. The exaggerated prominence given to philosophy, or rather
to dialectics, had caused a neglect of the Fathers, who were now
chiefly studied in Sums and Sentences, which professed to present
the student with the pith of theology in a single volume, forming the
text-books on which the doctors delivered lectures and commentaries,
coloured, naturally enough, with their own ideas. The
original works of the Fathers, which had been the familiar study of
the monastic students, appear at this time to have been little in
request; and when St. Louis, on his return from Palestine, formed
a plan for collecting a library of all the most useful and authentic
ecclesiastical writings, he had to get copies made of St. Ambrose,
St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Gregory, and other Catholic doctors,
from the codices stored up in remote monastic libraries; for in the
schools of Paris they were not to be found. The extreme scholastics,
indeed, were accustomed to speak of the Fathers as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rhetoricians</i>;
writers, that is, who expressed themselves according to the rules of
natural eloquence, a terrible delinquency in the eyes of the new
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illuminati</i>, who considered that a man should display his science by
loading his pages with the terms of logic&mdash;assertion, proof, major,
minor, and corollary. The good king, however, whose taste was
superior to that of most of his contemporaries, persevered in his
noble enterprise, and at great pains and cost collected a library of
the best Christian authors, in which he himself studied profoundly;
liberally granting its use to others also. “He read the works of the
Fathers, whose authority is established,” says his biographer, “more
willingly than those of the new doctors;” and he gave as a reason
for making new copies, in preference to buying up the old ones, that
by this means he multiplied writings which he desired should be
more widely known. He <ins class="corr" id="tn379" title="Transcriber’s Note—“ordored that after his death” changed to “ordered that after his death”.">ordered that after his death</ins>
this library should be divided among the three monasteries he had
founded; those, namely, of the Franciscans, the Dominicans, and the
Cistercians; and it was from this source that the Dominican, Vincent
of Beauvais, who filled the office of tutor to the royal children,
drew the materials of his famous work, <cite>The Great Mirror</cite>,
of which we shall hereafter have occasion to speak.</p>

<p>If positive theology and the humanities began to be neglected,
however, civil and canon law were better treated. The appearance
in 1157 of the “Decretals” of Gratian, had been followed by the
erection of a Chair of Jurisprudence at Bologna, and another at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
Paris. The new branch of study had one advantage which commended
it to popular favour: it led to substantial profits, and
scholars were found not unwilling to let Horace and Cicero drop
into disuse in favour of a science which paid so well for the time
spent on its acquisition. The prodigious popularity of these new
pursuits at length caused grave apprehensions lest the schools of arts
and theology should in time be altogether deserted, and in 1220
Honorius III. found it necessary to forbid the further study of civil
law at Paris. Crevier complains of this prohibition as injurious to
the university, and it was, in fact, very generally eluded; although
the formal permission to include civil law in the Faculty of Right
was not granted till 1679. But in point of fact, the alarm which
was felt was not without foundation. At Oxford such a revolution
had been brought about by the introduction of the law lectures, that
it was feared both arts and theology would be utterly neglected.
What was worse, the law students aspired after and obtained benefices;
and this abuse was encouraged by sovereigns, who found law
prelates much more easy to deal with, and to accommodate to their
own political views, than theologians. Innocent III. had, at last, to
prohibit the admission to benefices of those who had only graduated
in law, and insisted that all who aspired to ecclesiastical benefices
should also pursue a regular course of theology. The tendency of
the age, however, was manifest; the universities were falling more
and more away from that idea of education which the old system
had, in theory at any rate, professed to carry out; namely, the
presenting of knowledge as a whole, its various parts arranged under
the heads of the seven liberal arts, presided over by theology.
Philosophy, according to this idea, included a knowledge of truth in
all its various departments, and all the arts were but branches
springing from one trunk, one of which could not be struck off
without injuring the proportion and harmony of the whole.</p>

<p>The neglect of arts, and the excessive preponderance given to law
studies and dialectics, made up a grave and momentous change in the
whole theory of education, which was daily losing something more
of that breadth and largeness which formed one of the chief features
of education as proposed by the ancients, whose traditions had been
accepted by the Christian schools. This seems a fair statement of
the mischievous side of the change; but there is also another view
of the question, which justly claims to be recognised. There was a
deeper cause for the popularity of law and logic in the European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
schools of this period than any sordid motive of gain, or any mere
love of disputation. Both of them formed a part of that extraordinary
intellectual revolution which marked the opening of the
thirteenth century. Men had grown indifferent to the study of
language in proportion as they had been aroused to the deeper
interest of mental science. Though the immediate result was to
introduce a decay of polite letters, and not a few philosophic
extravagancies, it cannot be doubted that many faculties were roused
into vigorous action, which, under the former system, had lain
dormant. The grand defect of the old monastic scholars, as
scholars, was, that they cultivated learning rather than mind; they
studied other men’s thoughts, but were not equally exercised in
training their own. They seldom investigated for themselves either
mental or physical phenomena; whatever absurdities were to be
found in the natural philosophy which they received from the
ancients, were generally adopted without question, and handed on
to the next generation; and the instances are rare in which an
appeal is made to the results of personal observation.</p>

<p>Even their theological works were chiefly compilations, and St.
Anselm may be called the first original thinker who had appeared
among divines since the close of the fifth century. When the intellectual
powers of Europe again woke into action, men were not
unnaturally induced to regard mere elegances of style with a certain
rude indifference. Like soldiers who, when about to engage in a
conflict for life or death, are careless whether or no they wear their
holiday trappings, the scholastics of the thirteenth century, while
they exercised their mental powers in subtle disputation, conceived
a contempt for the charms of mere rhetoric, and valued language
only as the vehicle for expressing the distinctions of philosophy.
Under such circumstances Latinity, of course, grew barbarous; and
many far graver disorders arose out of the daring and undue exercise
of reason. Yet, real intellectual progress was being made, in spite
of the decay of letters; and the growth of mind went on in the
same way as the growth of body, when the delicate tints and graceful
form of childhood disappear, whilst bone and muscle are being
built up, and the feeble child is expanding into the strong-armed
man. When the revival of literature took place two centuries later,
it found a race of strong thinkers in place of diligent readers. The
scholars of the Renaissance were forward in ridiculing the barbarism
of the scholastic philosophers, but in doing so they showed that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
had very <ins class="corr" id="tn382" title="Transcriber’s Note—“superncially studied the intellectual era” changed to “superficially studied the intellectual era”.">superficially studied the intellectual era</ins>
that preceded their own. Undoubtedly, the <em>excess</em> of legal and
<ins class="corr" id="tn382b" title="Transcriber’s Note—“logical studies had many tbuses” changed to “logical studies had many abuses”.">logical studies had many abuses</ins>,
but they are not therefore to be arbitrarily condemned.
Even the lawyers, with whom it is most difficult to keep charity, and
whose influence was the most mischievous in the schools, had a
considerable share in the education of modern Europe. Careful
critics, on studying the legal documents of the Middle Ages, such, for
example, as our own Magna Charta, fail not to express their wonder
and admiration at the keenness of intellect which is displayed in
their provisions, and the precision of language in which they are
expressed. The men of the pen were cautiously and sagaciously
circumventing the men of the sword. Every constitutional principle
laid down in the statute-book established the sovereignty of law over
that of brute force; it was a victory of mind over matter, and was
therefore a mighty step in the history of intellectual progress.</p>

<p>These considerations must be calmly weighed before we pass any
judgment on the scholastic revolution of the thirteenth century.
Our sympathies, no doubt, will linger with the elder scholars, and we
shall be disposed to look with a very jealous eye on the triumph of
the sophists and the Cornificians; but it will suffice to reconcile us
to the temporary necessity of the change, that it was accepted by the
Church, and that she set her seal to the due and legitimate use of
those studies which were to develope the human intellect to its full-grown
strength. Nay, more, she absorbed into herself an intellectual
movement which, had she opposed it, would have been directed
against her authority, and so, to a great extent, neutralised its powers
of mischief. The scholastic philosophy, which, without her direction,
would have expanded into an infidel Rationalism, was woven into her
theology itself, and made to do duty in her defence, and that wondrous
spectacle was exhibited, so common in the history of the Church,
when the dark and threatening thunder cloud which seemed about to
send out its lightning bolts, only distils in fertilising rain.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The statutes of Robert de Courçon, after regulating the studies,
pass on to the manners of the students. They descend with great
simplicity into various details, which are not uninteresting, as furnishing
us with some idea of the usages of the times. Great banquets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
were forbidden to be held at the installation of new masters, who
were only allowed to invite a few companions and friends. No
master reading arts was to wear aught but a round black gown falling
as low as his heels, “at least,” adds the cardinal with much naïveté,
“<em>when it is new</em>.” A cloak is allowed, but the abomination of pointed
shoes is strictly prohibited. When a scholar of arts or theology died,
one-half of the masters were to attend his funeral; if it were a
master, all the other masters were to assist at the Office for the Dead.
They were, moreover, to recite, or cause to be recited, an entire
Psalter for his soul, to remain in the church where the Office was
celebrated until midnight, and on the day of burial all exercises in
the schools were to be suspended. He confirms to the students the
free possession of those broad and delightful meadows, so dearly
prized as a place of recreation, which gave their name to St. Germain
des Prés, and for the protection of the scholars, fixes the rate at
which the citizens shall be obliged to furnish them with lodgings.</p>

<p>The university thus established, redounded, it need not be said,
to the profit as well as to the glory of the French capital. Not only
the intellect, but the wealth also, of Europe flowed into that great
centre. New branches of industry sprang up in connection with the
schools; the Rue de Fouarre supplied them with straw for their
seats, and the Rue des Ecrivains was entirely peopled with booksellers
and book-lenders, mostly Jews, who furnished the scholars
with literary wares, suffering those who were too poor to buy, to hire
their volumes at a fixed rate. The bookselling trade fell at last under
the jurisdiction of the university, and the booksellers were enrolled as
academic officers, taking an oath on their appointment to observe
the statutes and regulations. They were not suffered to open a
traffic without testimonials as to character, and the tariff of prices
was fixed by four of their number appointed by the university.
Fines were imposed for incorrect copies, and the traders were bound
to hang up a priced catalogue in their shops. If books of heretical
or immoral tendency were found introduced, they were burnt by
order of the university officers. The same powers were exercised over
the book trade by the universities of Vienna, Toulouse, and Bologna,
and the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stationarii</i> began to be given to those who held
these stores; stalls, or shops of all descriptions, being often denominated
<em>Stations</em>. By degrees, however, the licensed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stationarii</i> lost their
monopoly of the trade, and the custom became tolerated of allowing
poor scholars to sell books of low price in order to obtain the means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
of pursuing their studies. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Librarii</i> were the copyists of new
books, who dealt also in parchment and writing materials, and
exercised a very important profession before the days of printing;
those who transcribed old books were considered a separate branch,
and styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquarii</i>, and by this distinction the scholar in search of
a volume knew at once from which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Statio</i> he might obtain the object
of his desires.</p>

<p>But as in those days of high prices and book scarcity, the poor
student was sorely impeded in his progress, to provide against these
disadvantages, a law was framed at Paris, compelling all public booksellers
to keep books to lend out on hire. The reader will be
surprised at the idea of lending libraries in the Middle Ages, but
there can be no doubt of the fact that they were established at Paris,
Toulouse, Vienna, and Bologna. These public librarians, too, were
obliged to write out regular catalogues of their books, and hang them
up in their shops with the prices affixed, so that the student might
know beforehand what he had to pay for reading each book. Some
of these lists are preserved, in which we find three sous charged for
the loan of Peter Lombard’s Book of the Sentences, and ten sous for
a Bible.</p>

<p>The custom began to be introduced among the scholars of
expending great sums on the adornment of their books with gilt
letters and fantastic illuminations, and writers of the time complain
of the extravagant sums thus dissipated. Thus Odofred speaks of a
certain gentleman who sent his son to Paris, giving him an annual
allowance of 100 livres. “What does he do? Why, he has his
books ornamented with gold initials and strange monsters, and has a
new pair of boots every Saturday.” The mention of these literary
trades leads me to speak of what we may call the great festival day
of the trades in general, and of the scholars and booksellers in particular.
Who has not heard of the great fair of St. Denis, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Landit</i>, as it was called, originally held to enable the Bishop of Paris
to display the relics preserved in the abbey to those devout multitudes
whose numbers, being too great for any church to contain
them, rendered it necessary to assemble them in the open fields?
A French poet describes this fair as he beheld it at the close of the
twelfth century, crowded with tailors, furriers, linendrapers, leather-sellers,
shoemakers, cutlers, corn-merchants, jewellers, and goldsmiths.
The enumeration of all the trades at last passes his powers, and he
begs his readers to excuse his completing the catalogue. And what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
has this to do with the university? it may be asked. Much, for
thither also flocked the sellers of parchment. The rector of the
university went there in state to choose the best article which the
fair produced; nay, what is more, all dealers in parchment were
forbidden by royal edict to purchase any on the first day of the fair,
until the merchants of the king and the bishop, and the masters and
scholars of the university, had laid in their yearly provision. This
going of the rector to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Landit</i> was the grand annual holiday. He
was attended by all the masters and scholars on horseback, and not
unfrequently, says Lebœuf, in his “History of the Diocese of Paris,”
this expedition was the occasion of many falling sick, through heat
and fatigue, especially the youngsters.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Landit</i> was not the only recreation day of the scholars;
besides those red-letter days which in olden time were lavishly provided
for solace and refreshment of mind and body, they took part
in all popular rejoicings, and on occasion of the great victory of
Bouvines claimed and obtained a whole week’s vacation, during
which time, says Lebœuf, “they sang and danced continually.” Their
country walks to Chantilly and other rural villages were known as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ire ad Campos</i>, for which leave had to be asked by the inmates of
colleges. James of Vitry alludes to the national characteristics
apparent in the different nations represented among the students, the
luxurious habits of the French, the love of fighting exhibited by the
Germans, and the propensity of the English to indulge in deep potations.
In the schools their habits were simple enough. The lectures
were begun punctually at the first stroke of the bells of Notre Dame,
as they rung out the hour of Prime. Clocks were not then very
common, and the cathedral bells, rung at the different hours and
heard at a great distance, furnished citizens and scholars with their
ordinary mode of reckoning time. At the last stroke the scholars
were supposed to be all assembled; seated on trusses of hay or straw,
which supplied the place of benches, they listened to the lecture of
the master, delivered after the manner of a spoken harangue, and
took such notes as they were able. The method of dictation, which
had been in use in the earlier schools, appears to have been dropped,
or to have been retained only in the more elementary schools. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i> lecture was, in fact, the speciality of the university system;
and to its use may, in great part, be attributed that enthusiasm which
animated the scholars of some popular master, who contrived to
infuse the charm of his personal grace and eloquence into the hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
syllogisms with which he dealt. “The act of instruction <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i>,”
says one, himself a master, “has I know not what hidden energy, and
sounds more forcibly in the ears of a disciple, when it passes from
the master’s lips, than the written word can do.” Hence these dry
logicians of the Middle Ages were possessed with as ardent an
enthusiasm for their own pursuits as that which kindled the armies
of the Crusaders; nay, when we read of the mad devotion of Abelard’s
followers, or the resistless impetuosity of those crowds who mustered
in the Place Maubert to listen to the great Albert as he lectured on
the Sentences, we need to bear in mind that the age was that of
generous impulse; keenly susceptible to personal influence, capable
of being roused to great enterprises by some strong word spoken to
the heart, and ready to cast itself on the shores of Palestine, or to
swell the ranks of a mendicant order, according to the deep emotions
called forth by some eloquent tongue.</p>

<p>The history of the university, indeed, is not without its chapters of
romance. At one time we may wander in imagination out into the
green meadows of St. Germains, and watch a group of young scholars,
John, the Englishman, and William Scot, with another John, of
Provençal blood, and his Italian fellow-student, the young Lothairius
Conti, as they join together in familiar talk, little thinking of the
changes which a few short years are to make in the destinies of each;
when the Provençal will have become the founder of the Trinitarian
Order, and his old companions, John and William, shall have flung
away their doctors’ caps, to assume the blue and crimson cross, and
it shall be from Lothaire himself, now seated in the chair of St. Peter
as Pope Innocent III., that he is to receive its first formal confirmation.</p>

<p>Or, shall we gaze for a moment on that poor ragged boy, begging
his bread in the streets of Paris, where like a rustic simpleton, he has
come in hopes of finding the way to fame and fortune? Yet, a
simpleton he is not;&mdash;he struggles on ill fed, ill-lodged, but, thanks
to pious alms, just able to scrape together the means of study. He
passes from one grade to another; and in time Paris learns to be
proud of her great doctor, Maurice of Sully, and forgets that he owes
his surname to the lordly territory where his fathers cultivated the
soil. At last his fame reaches his native place, and his old mother
who is still living, resolves to go and find out her boy, whom she
always knew would make his fortune. So taking staff in hand, she
found her way to the great city, and asked the first fine ladies whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
she met in the streets, if they could tell her where she could find the
Doctor Maurice. The good ladies, taking pity on her, took her to
their house, gave her refreshment, and throwing a better kind of
mantle over the coarse woollen petticoat which she wore, after the
fashion of French peasants, led her to Maurice, and introduced her
to him as his mother. “Not so,” said Maurice, “my mother is a
poor peasant woman, she wears no fine clothes like these; I will not
believe it is her unless I see her in her woollen petticoat.” Then she
threw off her cloak, and seeing her in her own garb he embraced her,
and introduced her to the great people who stood about him, saying,
“This is indeed my mother.” “And the thing spread through the
city,” says the chronicler, “and did good honour to the master, who
afterwards became Bishop of Paris;” in which office he did many
notable things, and among others built the present Cathedral of
Notre Dame.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>I might ask my readers, in like manner, to glance at other scenes,
no less characteristic; to look into that same cathedral where crowds
have assembled to hear the preaching of the famous doctor, John of
St. Quentin. He has chosen the subject of holy poverty, and he
seems inspired by some unwonted strain of eloquence as he speaks
of the snares, the emptiness, and the vanity of the world. At last he
stops, and descends the pulpit stairs. Is his discourse finished, or
what is he about to do? the crowd moves hither and thither with
curiosity, and sees him kneeling at the feet of the Dominican Prior
of St. James, of whose Order little was then known, save that its
members were mendicants, and owed their lodging in the city to the
bounty of this very John. But now the white habit is thrown over
his doctor’s gown, the black mantle, the garb of poverty and humility
is added, and he returns to finish his discourse, exhibiting to his
wondering audience that he can teach not by words only, but by
example. Or, once more let us wander into that old church of St.
Mery, which even to this day retains a certain air of quaint antiquity;
where the long lancet windows, and the Ladye chapel with its carved
wooden reredos, black with age, and adorned with silver statuettes,
and its walls frescoed with the figures of saints, carry us back to
mediæval times; and the cool air with its sweet fragrance of incense,
and the silence broken only by a passing footstep on the worn and
broken pavement, soothe and tranquillise us as though we had passed
out of the busy streets into the atmosphere of another world. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
that church, and before that Ladye altar, you might nightly have seen
an English scholar, who had passed over to Paris whilst still a mere
boy to study his course of arts. Every night he comes hither to
assist at Matins, and remains there till daybreak, kneeling absorbed
in heavenly contemplation till the hour strikes which is the signal for
him to betake himself to the schools. Against those very pillars,
perhaps, he leant his weary head; that dusty and shattered pavement
was once watered with his tears; and who is there that loves and
venerates the memory of St. Edmund of Canterbury, who will not, for
his sake, be glad to escape from the thoroughfares of the brilliant
capital to spend an hour of pilgrimage in the church of St. Mery?<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Pictures such as these, embodying the legends of an age, the
daily life of which was fraught with poetry, might be multiplied to
any extent; but I prefer to fix the reader’s attention on one which
tells more of the university life of Paris at this precise epoch, than
could be conveyed by many a laboured description. It was then
about the year 1199, just when the princes of Europe were deliberating
on a fifth crusade, that there lived at Neuilly-sur-Marne, halfway
between Paris and Lagny, a simple country Curé, named Fulk,
unlearned in worldly and even in divine science, but full of holy zeal,
governing his parish with all diligence, and preaching with a certain
rude eloquence&mdash;not sparing of his reproofs, but ready at all times
to speak the truth boldly and freely alike to rich and poor. He who,
of old, chose unlettered fishermen to be the heralds of His Word,
made choice of this poor priest to reform the follies of those vain
scholars who, to use the words of James of Vitry, “intent on vain
wranglings and questions of words, cared not to break the Bread
of Life to little ones.” Feeling his own want of knowledge, and
specially his ignorance of the Holy Scriptures, Fulk determined, old
as he was, to commence a regular course of study in the schools, and
began to go regularly into the city, attending the theological lectures
of Peter the Chanter. How the gay scholars stared and wondered
at the sight of the rustic Curé, in his coarse frock and grey hairs,
humbly entering the school, with his note-book in his hand, wherein
he entered only a few phrases, such as his poor capacity was able to
gather from the lips of the speaker. He understood little and cared
less for all the terms of art which the dialecticians of those days so
lavishly dispensed to their hearers; and if his companions had
glanced over his shoulder, they would have read on the parchment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
page nothing but some scattered texts of Scripture, sprinkled here
and there with trite and practical maxims. Yet these were enough
for Fulk: they were the seed falling into good ground, watered with
prayer and meditation, and bringing forth the hundredfold. Often did
he read and ponder over his little book, and commit its maxims to
his memory, and on Sundays and Festival days, returning to his own
parish, he gave forth to his flock what he had thus carefully gathered
in the schools. His master, observing the zeal and fervour of his
new disciple, and penetrating through that rough exterior which
concealed a richly-gifted soul, required of him at last that he should
preach in the Church of St. Severinus before himself and a great
number of the students. Fulk obeyed with his accustomed simplicity,
and lo! “the Lord gave to His servant such grace and power
that it seemed as if the Holy Spirit spoke by his mouth; and from
that day masters and scholars began to flock to his rude and simple
preaching. They would invite one another, saying, ‘Come and
hear the priest Fulk&mdash;he is another Paul.’”</p>

<p>One day a vast multitude were assembled to hear him in the
Place de Champeaux, for the churches were not large enough to
contain those who gathered to the preaching; and he spoke with such
eloquence that hundreds, pierced to the very heart, fell at his feet,
and, presenting him with rods, besought him to chastise them for
their sins, and guide them in the way of penance. He embraced
them all, giving thanks to God, and to each one he gave some
suitable words of advice. He had something appropriate to say to
all, to usurers and public sinners, fine gentlemen, men-at-arms, and
scholars. He admonished the masters to give more pithy, wholesome,
and profitable lectures in the fear of God; he bade the dialecticians
put away what was unprofitable in their art, and retain
only that which bore fruit; the canonists he reproved for their long
and wearisome disquisitions; the theologians for their tediousness
and over-subtlety; and so, in like manner, he fearlessly rebuked and
admonished the teachers of other arts, and called on them to leave
their vain babblings, and apply themselves to what was profitable to
salvation.</p>

<p>The tide had now fairly turned, and those who, awhile before,
were ready to turn the poor Curé into ridicule, gladly changed
places with him, and brought their note-books to <em>his</em> preaching, that
they might take down the words from his mouth. Many even
entreated him to accept them as his followers, and missions began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
to be preached through all the neighbouring towns and villages by
the company of learned doctors, who put themselves under the
direction of the Curé of Neuilly. Among these were Peter the
Chanter, his former master; Alberic de Laon, afterwards Archbishop
of Rheims; Robert de Courçon, of whom we have already spoken;
and our own Stephen Langton.</p>

<p>Fulk and his followers preached throughout France, Burgundy,
Flanders, and a great part of Germany. Their missions were
followed by a great reform of manners, and the sanctity of Fulk is
said to have been attested by miracles. He had a vein of pleasantry
in him, and sometimes treated his audience with a somewhat rough
familiarity; and, if he could obtain silence by no other means, would
freely use his stick over the shoulders of the disorderly. But the
people esteemed his very blows a blessing; wherever he appeared,
they pressed around him to tear away morsels of his habit. One day
he was nearly suffocated, and owed his deliverance to an ingenious
device&mdash;“My habit is not blessed,” he cried, “to what purpose, then,
would you carry it away? But I will bless the clothes of yonder
man, and you may take as much as you choose.” The individual
whom he indicated was at once surrounded, and thought himself
happy to escape with the loss of his mantle.</p>

<p>These scenes were of daily occurrence when Fulk, having himself
assumed the Cross, began to preach the Holy War; and, in fact,
the throngs who joined the Fifth Crusade from France and Flanders
were chiefly induced to do so by his eloquence. He chanced, on
one occasion, to hear that Count Thibault of Champagne had proclaimed
a magnificent tournament, which was to take place at the
Château d’Ecris, in the forest of Ardennes. All the chivalry of
France and England were gathered there; but amid the tossing
plumes and glittering pennons appeared the figure of Fulk of
Neuilly, who bade them first hear him, and painted to them the
higher glory which they might acquire in the sacred wars, instead of
wasting their time and strength on the mock combats of a tournament.
A fiery ardour kindled the brilliant throng, and Thibault
himself, with his noble guest, Simon de Montfort, and the two
brothers, Walter and John de Brienne, the latter of whom was
destined to wear the crown of Jerusalem, and five of the house of
Joinville, and that heroic knight, Sir Matthew de Montmorency,
whose valour was so renowned that Richard of England reckoned
it his greatest deed of prowess to have overcome him in single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
combat:&mdash;all these, and many more, hastened to receive the Cross
from the hands of the preacher, and to prepare for that expedition
which was to terminate with the Conquest, not of Jerusalem, but of
Constantinople.</p>

<p>It is not my intention, however, to speak further of the crusading
career of Fulk de Neuilly, and I have only introduced him here as
an illustration of the spirit which then animated all classes, whether
knights or doctors, easily swayed as they were to good or evil by the
words of a powerful leader; and to show, moreover, in what light
the subtle dialectics of the Paris schools were regarded by the
Apostle of his times.</p>

<p>We must now turn our attention to some of the other European
universities, and first to that of Bologna, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mater Studiorum</i>, as it
was called, of Italy, which vied with Paris in point of antiquity as in
renown. The revival of the study of Roman jurisprudence, which
took place in this city under Irnerius, has already been noticed;
when a chair of civil law was first erected in the High School, which
had existed in Bologna from very early times. It is unnecessary to
enter into the vexed question of the so-called discovery of the
Pandects<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> at Amalfi in 1137, which, according to Sigonius, was the
origin of a total change in the Italian jurisprudence. Tiraboschi
calls the whole story in question, and represents that the Pandects
had really never been lost, and that the revival of law studies must
be traced to the efforts made about that time by the Italian cities
to free themselves from the Imperial yoke, and appoint their own
judges and magistrates. However that may be, the fame of Bologna
as the first law school in Europe was fairly established by the end of
the twelfth century, and there is not an Italian writer of that period
who has not something to say of the science of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docta Bononia</i>. By
the middle of the same century the study of canon law had been
added to that of civil jurisprudence, chiefly, as has been before said,
after the publication of the Decretals of Gratian. This prodigious
work, executed by a simple Benedictine monk of Chiusi, was a
summary of the decrees of the Popes, and of 150 councils, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
selections from various royal codes, and extracts from the Fathers
and other ecclesiastical writers, all methodically arranged so as to
facilitate its use in the schools. Its compilation incessantly occupied
the author for the space of twenty-five years. Many errors found
their way into the work, which contained some false quotations, and
cited as authorities certain <ins class="corr" id="tn392" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Errata: Page 406, line 6, for “degrees,” read “decrees”.">decrees</ins>
and synodical acts which have
since been proved to be spurious, and are known as the False
Decretals. But whatever were its shortcomings, it gave a facility
to the study of canon law which had not before existed, and the two
branches of jurisprudence were immediately professed side by side
in the schools of Bologna. Almost at the same time the students
obtained some important privileges, which encouraged foreigners to
resort to a university where they were secure of protection from the
civil power. In 1158, when the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa held
his great diet on the plains of Roncaglia, for the purpose of publishing
a code of laws which should secure his own power in Italy, four
professors were summoned from Bologna to assist in the deliberations.
He treated them with much distinction, and with good
reason, as they fully supported the Imperial claims. They did,
however, better service to their university by obtaining from the
emperor those celebrated ordinances known as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habita</i>, which,
though originally promulgated in favour of Bologna, came to be
recognised as establishing similar rights in other European universities.
In them he extends his protection in a special manner to the
masters and scholars. “It is our duty to protect all our subjects,”
he says, “but specially those whose science enlightens the world,
and who teach our people the obligation of obeying God and us, the
ministers of His Divine power. Who will not have compassion,” he
continues, “on those precious exiles, whom the love of learning has
banished from their own countries, who have exposed themselves to
a thousand dangers, and, far from their friends and families, live
here without defence, in poverty and peril?” He therefore directs
that all foreign students shall have safe-conduct both for themselves
and their messengers, both for coming, going, and reading at the
university, and that if anything be taken from them, the magistrates
of the city shall be bound to restore it fourfold. Moreover, he
exempts them from the ordinary civil jurisdiction, and grants the
right of being judged by the master of the school to which they
belong, or by the bishop.</p>

<p>The grant of these privileges at once raised the Bolognese university<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
to a position which ranked it on a level with that of Paris, and
whilst a tide of scholars from beyond the Alps, as well as from the
other Italian cities, flowed in, eager to take advantage of these
imperial favours, the Roman pontiffs began to extend their protection
to the rising institute. The first of these was Alexander III.,
who had a particular interest in the university, having taught theology
there for some years before his elevation to the purple.</p>

<p>Among the more famous Bolognese scholars were St. Thomas of
Canterbury; Lotharius Conti, afterwards Pope Innocent III., both
of whom read canon law here after finishing their theology at Paris;
Vacarius, afterwards law professor at Oxford; and the troubadour
chronicler, Geoffrey de Vinesauf, who, though an Englishman by
birth, seems to have been rather ashamed of the barbarism of his
mother country, and declares that to go from England to Rome was
like going from darkness to light, and passing from earth into
heaven.</p>

<p>He was the author of the <cite>Ars Poetica</cite>, and of another learned work
entitled <cite>Ars Dictaminis</cite>, written for the use of his Bolognese pupils;
but he is chiefly remembered as the companion and historian of
Richard Cœur de Lion, in the Second Crusade.</p>

<p>Before the end of the twelfth century, Bologna numbered 10,000
students, and in the following generation the influence exercised in
the schools by the Dominican Order, which made its headquarters
in Bologna, still further extended its fame. At this time, besides
the law lecturers, there were professors of moral and natural philosophy;
but it is somewhat singular that this flourishing university
does not appear to have had any regular chair of theology before
1362, in which year a Bull for the erection of the theological faculty
was issued by Innocent VI. But we are not to suppose that the
study of theology was therefore neglected, for the want was supplied
by the schools attached to the monastic houses, specially the
monasteries of St. Felix and St. Proculus, and those of the two
orders of Friars. It was in one of these schools that Rolando
Bandinelli, afterwards Pope Alexander III., must have taught, as
he professed theology at Bologna at the same time that Gratian
taught canon law, when certainly no other theological schools existed
in the university. Nor was this state of things peculiar to Bologna.
In Padua likewise, the students appear to have been for some time
dependent on the monastic schools for the means of following their
theological studies; so that in 1280 we find the Abbot Engelbert,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
after completing his course of philosophy in the university, removing
to the convent of the Friar Preachers to study theology. Afterwards,
when the Emperor Frederic II. drove the Friars out of his
dominions, the university had recourse to the Benedictines of Monte
Cassino, who sent thither the monk Erasmus to open a theological
school. We also find honourable mention in this century of a
certain Florentine physician named Taddeo, a professor of the
university, of whom the Bolognese were so proud that they granted
his scholars the privilege of law students. The common physician’s
fee at this time was a load of hay for his horse; but Taddeo, if
summoned to a distance, demanded fifty gold scudi, and a safe-conduct
out and home. This is one of the earliest instances on
record in which medicine takes its place among the other learned
faculties. The pay of all these professors seems to have been extremely
small, and never exceeding the sum of 200 <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lire</i>, about £40.</p>

<p>The university of Padua appears to have owed its erection to a
quarrel among the Bolognese professors, some of whom migrated in
a body, about the year 1222, and opened schools which soon attracted
the notice of the learned. The new university was specially distinguished
by its excellent school of arts; these, as we have seen, were
sinking into neglect at Paris; but under the genial sky of Italy, and
in a country where Latin was still so completely regarded as the native
and living tongue, that as yet no one had thought of using the
vernacular Italian for literary purposes, it was impossible that the
names of Cicero and Virgil should be suffered to drop into oblivion.
Hence we find that the scholars of Padua <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il Dotto</i> cultivated a taste
for the profane poets and the great writers of antiquity; and it has
been observed that Albert the Great, who studied in her schools for
at least ten years, was so imbued with the classic literature, that his
very sermons often present us with a tissue of philosophic maxims,
drawn from the writings of Virgil, Juvenal, and Cicero, the latter of
whom he styles affectionately <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noster Tullius</i>. A love of the classics,
in fact, survived in most of the Italian schools, and Hasse tells us
that the Mantuans went so far as to give their capital the title of the
“Virgilian city,” in honour of the great bard, whose statue they
erected in their market-place, and on the 15th of October (which was
supposed to be his birthday) danced around it, crowned with laurel,
and singing verses in his praise.</p>

<p>Tiraboschi observes that in none of these universities does there
appear to have been erected anything like a library for the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
students. Copyists seem to have been employed to furnish them
with books, at a given price, and in Bologna, women were employed
on this work, a fact to which P. Sarti ungallantly attributes the frequent
errors found in many MSS. of the time. The rich collections
of books which had formerly been found in the cathedral and monastic
libraries, had been for the most part dispersed during the wars which
had ravaged Italy for so many centuries, and the scanty catalogues
which are preserved, generally present us with no more than the
names of a few books on canon or civil law.</p>

<p>In addition to the Italian universities already named, must be
noticed that of Naples, which owed its foundation, in 1224, to the
Emperor Frederic II. That monarch, irritated at the opposition
which he met with from the citizens of Bologna, who warmly
embraced the cause of the Popes, and refused to receive the emperor
within their walls, conceived, in revenge, the plan of ruining the
university of the refractory city, by establishing a rival institution in
his own Sicilian states. For this purpose he chose the city of Naples,
and used every effort to attract scholars, by the grant of extraordinary
privileges; and masters, by the promise of rare pecuniary advantages.
As regarded his own subjects he did not allow much liberty of choice,
but absolutely forbade them, under penalties, to study either at
Bologna or Paris, or anywhere but at the Imperial academy. No
cost was spared to put it on an equal footing with the institutions
with which it was to compete; an immense sum was expended in the
collection of Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew books, many of those
in the last three tongues being translated at the royal expense. The
works of Aristotle are said to have been translated into Latin by the
famous Michael Scott, who at that time filled the office of astrologer
to the emperor. The professor of philosophy was the almost equally
celebrated Peter the Irishman, grammar and rhetoric being taught
by another Peter, an Italian by birth. In short, ample provision
was made for the intellectual profit of the students, but further
than this little could be expected from a founder of Frederic’s
character.</p>

<p>Touron, in his life of St. Thomas, has given us a frightful picture
of the state of morals prevailing in the Ghibbeline university, and
says that there was a common proverb at that time current in Italy, to
the effect that Naples was an earthly paradise inhabited by demons.
Frederic was indeed a splendid patron of learning, and is said to have
been well skilled in the German, French, Latin, Greek, and Arabic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
tongues. His book on birds is praised by Humboldt,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> as displaying
a knowledge of natural history which at that time was truly extraordinary.
He was also reckoned, like all the princes of his house, to be
a good poet, and a somewhat freethinking philosopher. Much of his
literary and scientific tastes he owed to the influence of his celebrated
chancellor, Peter delle Vigne, who had studied at Bologna, and was
considered one of the most learned men of his time. But his learning
was steeped in the infidelity peculiar to the age; and common belief
attributed to him and to his Imperial master the authorship of a
blasphemous work, entitled “The Three Impostors,” though the
truth of this is warmly disputed. Suspected of treachery by the
emperor, Peter delle Vigne was at last deprived of his eyes, and
imprisoned in a monastery, where, in 1245, he miserably put an end
to his own life by dashing out his brains against a wall.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>So much has been said by historians of the protection afforded to
letters by Frederic and his successors on the throne of Sicily, that we
might almost be led to suppose that the Ghibbeline monarchs had
none to share their fame in this respect. But in point of fact the Popes
in this, as in all times, were the true nursing fathers of Christian
science. To Innocent III., himself one of the most learned men of
his age, the university of Paris was indebted for that body of laws of
which we have already spoken; he also granted large privileges to
the university of Bologna, and it was he who ordained in the Fourth
Lateran Council that provision should be made for the maintenance
of Christian studies, by the appointment in every cathedral church of
a master in grammar for the instruction of the younger clerics, as
well as of a theologian. His successor, Honorius III., directed the
chapters to send certain of the younger canons to study at the universities,
and granted them a dispensation from the obligation of
residence; and we are told he once removed a bishop on finding
him grossly ignorant of grammar. Benedict XII. confirmed the
decrees of his predecessors, and required not only cathedrals, but also
monasteries and priories, to provide a master to instruct the younger
monks in grammar, logic and philosophy.</p>

<p>Gregory IX. who, according to Muratori, was profoundly skilled in
the liberal arts, and whom he calls “a river of Tullian eloquence,”
drew up five books of decretals, and was so firm a friend to the
university of Paris, that, to use the expression of Crevier “it had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
other support during the troubles with which it was vexed in the
thirteenth century, than in this Pope.” Innocent IV. erected public
schools of law at Rome, and founded the university of Piacenza,
besides which, as Crevier acknowledges, he surpassed all his predecessors
in the benefits which he heaped on the university of Paris, and
the singular protection he afforded it. Such was the zeal of this
pontiff in promoting learning, that wherever he was, he established in
his palace a little university. Thus, being at Lyons in the second
year of his pontificate, he opened a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">studium generale</i> at his court for
the study of theology and canon law; and did the same at Naples,
where he died; and at the Council of Lyons in 1245, he enforced the
decrees of previous pontiffs regarding the establishment of cathedral
grammar schools for the gratuitous education of poor children.</p>

<p>It was Gregory X. who, among the other acts of his glorious pontificate,
moved the King of Sicily to restore the schools which had
fallen into decay in his dominions. His letter is printed in the
collection of Martene. God, he says, has willed that man fallen into
barbarism should be taught and civilised by the culture of the arts
and sciences. It is study which confers on man the grace of a
cultivated education, as a heavenly gift; and the king who uses his
power to continue a generation of wise and learned men, and to
provide the Church with worthy ministers, performs an act most
honourable and pleasing to God.</p>

<p>To Urban IV. belongs the glory of having revived the study of
philosophy in Italy. He is known to have commanded St. Thomas to
comment on the works of Aristotle; and so great was his love of this
branch of learning, that he always had at his table certain professors
whom he would afterwards cause to sit at his feet and engage in erudite
disputations among themselves, he himself presiding over their trial of
wits, and deciding to whom the victory was due. It was to his noble
encouragement that the world owed the mathematical works of
Campano of Novara, whom he appointed his chaplain, and who
wrote a learned commentary on Euclid. In one of the mathematical
treatises of this philosopher, is to be found a dedication to Urban, in
which he eulogises the magnificent support afforded by that pontiff
to philosophical studies, which, owing to his encouragement, after
having long languished in the dust, were once more loved and cultivated.
The university of Montpellier was founded by Nicholas IV.,
and that of Cracow by Urban V.</p>

<p>We also find that, besides the universities, a vast number of public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
schools were opened in Italy during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
most of them by authority of the Sovereign Pontiffs; those
founded in Rome by Innocent IV. were at first exclusively intended
for the study of law, but in 1303 Boniface VIII. erected these schools
into a university for every faculty. Other schools of grammar,
medicine, and law arose at Modena, Reggio and Parma, and at
Milan there were no fewer than eighty schoolmasters instructing
youth in the year 1288. The college of the Sapienza, at Perugia,
was founded by Innocent IV. out of his private purse, for the
education of forty boys, as the Gregorian college was raised somewhat
later at Bologna by Pope Gregory XI. And of Urban V. we read
that he supported more than a thousand scholars at different academies
at his own expense, and supplied them with the books necessary
for prosecuting their studies.</p>

<p>Enough has, perhaps, been said to show that the Roman Pontiffs
of this period were not altogether indifferent to the interests of
learning. Owing partly to their encouragement, and partly to the
excessive popularity then attaching to the study of law, the number
of universities continued, during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, to multiply in a manner which makes it difficult to conjecture
how students could have been found to people so many
academies. Thus, in France alone, we find the universities of
Toulouse,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Montpellier, Orleans, Lyons, Avignon, Poictiers, Angers,
Bourdeaux, Bourges, Cahors, Nantes, Rheims, Caen, Valence, and
Grenoble; in Italy, there were those of Ravenna, Salerno, Arezzo,
Ferrara, Perugia, Piacenza, Siena, Treviso, Vercelli, Pavia, and
Vicenza; in Spain, the two great universities of Salamanca, and
Valladolid, besides twenty-four smaller ones; in Poland, of Cracow;
in Germany, of Vienna, Prague, Heidelberg, Cologne, and Erfurt,
besides others of rather later date. Sixty-six such institutions
altogether are reckoned as having been founded in various European
countries before the period of the Reformation. The numbers of
students who repaired to these academies was certainly very great.
At Bologna, in the thirteenth century, we find mention of ten thousand
scholars; at Paris, of forty thousand; at Bourdeaux, a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
college boasted of upwards of two thousand scholars; and Oxford,
in Henry III.’s time, is said to have contained thirty thousand.
These universities had each their own distinctive character&mdash;Paris
excelled in theology, Montpellier and Salerno in medicine, Pavia in
the arts, Bologna, Bourges, and Orleans in jurisprudence. Caen,
an English foundation was particularly favoured by the monastic
students, and a great number of abbeys had here their own colleges,
the abbots being accustomed to assemble and assist at the yearly
opening of the schools. Of the English universities we will speak more
at length in another chapter, but it remains for us to say a few words
here on the general character and tendency of all these institutions,
and of the revolution which their establishment brought about in the
system of education.</p>

<p>To form something like an accurate judgment on this matter, we
must glance back at some of the facts elicited in the foregoing pages.
From what has been already said, it will appear that the germ of all
Christian schools is to be found in the episcopal seminaries&mdash;those
seminaries which, in ancient times, formed a part of the bishop’s own
household, and in which he himself personally directed the studies
of his younger clergy, and trained them to the duties of the ecclesiastical
state. The cathedral or canonical schools were but the
expansion of these early seminaries, over which the bishop still
presided, the office of scholasticus being conferred on one of the
canons, though, as we have seen, masters were often invited to direct
the studies from other dioceses. The monastic schools were formed
on the model of these episcopal schools, the abbot doing for his own
monks what the bishop did for the clergy of his diocese. The constitution
of all these schools was most strictly ecclesiastical, and
though seculars were admitted to share in their advantages, they
were primarily intended for the education of the clergy. The strong
religious character that must have been impressed on the education
given in such academies was perfectly in harmony with the spirit of
the early ages, when, as Balmez remarks, the intellectual development
of Europe had a distinctly theological bias. Religion in those
days was the preponderating element, it ruled the family and the
state, as well as the individual: and in days when the laws were
drawn up in the spirit and the language of ecclesiastical canons, there
was nothing at all out of place in the sons of knights and nobles
being set to study church chant, the Psalter, and the Fathers. That
their studies were by no means <em>exclusively</em> theological has, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
been amply shown; nevertheless, it is undeniable that, in the ecclesiastical
schools, the liberal arts were chiefly cultivated in their relation
to the things of faith, and that every branch of learning was more or
less tinged with the theological element.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that such a state of things could continue
without large modification. Nations, like individuals, pursue
an inevitable course of mental development, and the time necessarily
came when the human mind, growing from childhood into
maturity, demanded a wider and freer expansion. Hence ensued
that remarkable change observable at the opening of the eleventh
century, when the European intellect seemed to be passing out of a
long winter into a sudden spring, and burst into a vigorous activity,
accompanied, naturally enough, by many excesses. Schools and
teachers were indefinitely multiplied; the office of teaching was no
longer confined to ecclesiastics, and, falling into the hands of lay
professors, unavoidably assumed a new character. But it is remarkable
that the main principles of the former system still remained in
force. Education was recognised to be a religious work, and one
which, as such, fell under the jurisdiction of the bishop. As chief
pastor in his own diocese, he was supreme in all things appertaining
to the spiritual interests of his flock, and the office of teaching was
acknowledged to be one that fell under his pastoral charge.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The
new scholastics, therefore, were not entirely exempted from episcopal
jurisdiction; and in the eleventh century we find the system generally
established, according to which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scholasticus</i> of the cathedral, or
bishop’s school, exercised a certain control over all the schools in
the diocese, no professor being suffered to open any private school
without a license from him.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> I do not know whether we can affirm
that there were episcopal inspectors, but there were certainly certificated
masters in the days of St. Anselm. The office of cathedral
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scholasticus</i> belonged properly to the archdeacon of the diocese, who
might appoint a substitute to direct the school, but with whom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
power of granting licenses always remained. In many churches it
was also identical with the office of chancellor.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>And here one observation irresistibly presents itself. How striking
a contrast does not this system offer to that which finds favour
in our own times! Here we see it formally and distinctly recognised
that the office of teacher was one of those that fell directly
under episcopal supervision. The bishop of the diocese exercised
jurisdiction over schools, as he did over churches, in virtue of his
pastoral office, and his license was the necessary certificate of moral
and intellectual fitness. But, according to the principles accepted
by most countries which rejoice in a National system of education,
the authority formerly exercised by the bishop is transferred to a
Board. We make over to a minister of public instruction, or a
committee of privy council, or some other secular organ of an unspiritual
state, what our fathers regarded as an integral portion of the
pastoral office, an incongruity which, little as it now startles us, is, we
may say without exaggeration, scarcely less opposed to the Christian
order than if the crown should assume the power of granting
faculties to preach. What wonder that the result of such a change
should be the gradual, but most sure, unchristianising of the popular
mind, and that infidelity has found no more efficient allies than the
multitudinous and plausible codes of state education which have
sprung up since the destruction of the ancient system!</p>

<p>That the control thus recognised as belonging to the bishop
through his officers was not merely nominal is quite clear. In 1132,
we find Stephen de Senlis, Bishop of Paris, through his chancellor,
interdicting a certain professor, named Galon, from continuing to
teach. Galon persisted, in defiance of the bishop; and, his pupils
deserting his school through fear of incurring ecclesiastical censures,
he was at last put to silence. However, he appealed to the Pope,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
and this, says Crevier, “is the first occasion in which the authority of
the Court of Rome appears as interfering in the affairs of the university.”
He adds that it was also the beginning of those disputes
which the university of Paris maintained for long years against the
bishop and chancellor of Notre Dame, arising out of the claims of
the latter to exercise jurisdiction over the schools, and the vigorous
resistance of the academic authorities. It is clear that the episcopal
rights were never totally and completely revoked; nevertheless, they
were reduced to a <em>minimum</em>, and the universities, to all practical
purposes, established their independence. And the change thus
introduced was the more portentous from the fact that, with the rise
of the universities, we date the disappearance of the episcopal
seminaries. “The institution of seminaries,” says Theiner, “disappeared
throughout Christendom after the twelfth century.” The
universities became the great seats of learning, human and divine,
and though the cathedral schools continued to exist, their students
passed from them at an early age to finish their education in theology
and canon law in Paris, Oxford, and Bologna; whilst, in many
cases, the cathedral schools themselves were absorbed in the new
universities of which they formed the nucleus. The bishops, unable
to stem the tide, were forced to yield to it, and to witness the
education of their clergy passing out of their own control into the
hands of newly-constituted bodies which jealously disputed their
authority, which were often enough infected with an infidel philosophy,
which did not at first supply their members with any spiritual
or moral discipline, and which were not necessarily impressed with
an ecclesiastical character. For, what is a university? “It consists,”
says a writer in the “Analecta Juris Pontificii,”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> “of an
aggregation of schools, governed by a body of doctors, who divide
among themselves the several branches of instruction which, in the
public schools, are united under one master.” “A university,” says
Crevier, “is a body composed of masters teaching and disciples
who are taught.” And the writer first quoted goes on to examine
whether it would have been possible or desirable for the universities
to have established the collegiate discipline of the ancient schools
with a view to protect the piety and morals of the students, and
decides that such an attempt would have been a chimera. The
universities, he says, were intended for seculars as well as clerics,
and it was, therefore, unfitting that the rule of clerical schools should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
be enforced in them. But it is at least obvious that a prodigious
and calamitous revolution was being effected in the education of the
clergy when young clerics were trained in academies wherein such
rules were avowedly <em>not</em> enforced. The difference was this, that
in old time they had received secular students into their seminaries,
and then the education of laymen was tinged with an
ecclesiastical character. Now the world received clerics into her
academies, and the education of the future clergy of Europe became
necessarily, in a certain sense, secularised. Nor is this said as in
any way depreciating the universities, or representing them in an
unfavourable light. They will lose nothing by being represented as
what they truly are, academies of science, schools of worldly training,
learned corporations in which degrees are granted for intellectual
proficiency in liberal studies, and in which a man acquires
knowledge, refinement, and all that can fit him for taking his place
in society, and filling it with credit. Yet, all this does not make
them substitutes for ecclesiastical seminaries. They are doubtless
capable of being employed in the service of religion, and have often
been so employed: they have been established and encouraged by
the bulls of Popes, and, in more than one instance, founded with the
direct view of furnishing bulwarks against the spread of heresy.
Yet, it is evident that, as places of education for the clergy, the
universities were at a disadvantage. They could not give the young
clerics that training in the ecclesiastical spirit which they had hitherto
enjoyed. Even granting that the establishment of colleges afforded
the benefits of regular life to their students, it could not give them
the watchful protection of their bishop’s eye. That close and
paternal tie which had grown up between the chief pastor and his
future clergy was altogether lost, except, indeed, in so far as the
evil results of the system were counteracted by the personal efforts
of the bishop. And here, happily, some of the habits of feudal
society came to his aid, and enabled him to receive into the enormous
household then maintained by every lord, whether spiritual or
temporal, a number of young clerks, who, after their university career
was over, thus passed under the immediate rule of their bishop, and
received a certain sort of ecclesiastical training at his hands.</p>

<p>Fleury speaks of this custom as universal throughout the Church
in the Middle Ages; and says that each bishop took special care of
the instruction of his clergy, particularly of those young clerics who
were continually about his person, serving him in the capacity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
lectors or secretaries, carrying his letters and transmitting his orders.
These episcopal households, however, could not do the work of a
seminary, still less could they undo the work of a university in the
souls of those who had been subjected for a course of years to its
social and intellectual training. The idea of the seminary, and the
episcopal or monastic school, is pre-eminently that of preservation;
it takes the soul in the freshness of youth, and hedges round with
thorns the garden that is to be consecrated to God. But according
to the mediæval university system, a lad began his studies at Oxford
or Paris at the age of twelve or fourteen, and seldom spent less than
nine, sometimes twelve, years in native or foreign academies, so that
the whole of his most impressible years were spent in the midst of
secular fellow-students, thus opening upon him a flood of evils that
scarcely require to be pointed out. The dissolute manners which
prevailed, specially in the Italian universities, which were, perhaps,
next to that of Paris, the most frequented, are depicted by successive
Pontiffs as a sort of moral contagion. In many there prevailed a
tone of philosophic scepticism, even yet more gravely injurious.
False opinions were supported by the example and eloquence of fine
scholars and great intellects, and few could enter such an atmosphere,
and be subjected to such an influence, without at least losing
some of the instincts of faith. The habits of expense, rendered
fashionable by wealthy students, brought poverty, the scholar’s
ancient and honourable badge, into disrepute, and encouraged an
eagerness for offices and benefices. The office of teaching itself lost
something of its ancient nobility when made a means of ministering
to cupidity and ambition; for it must be owned there were few
Wolfgangs to be found at Paris or Bologna. And as avarice and
sensuality became the predominant vices of those out of whose
ranks the future clergy were to be formed, what wonder that the two
centuries which followed the rise of these brilliant and captivating
academies should be filled with complaints of clerical corruption;
that the salt of the earth should have lost its savour, and that abuses
accumulated which cried loudly for reform?</p>

<p>But besides all this the universities had a spirit of their own. In
most cases they were creations of the State, and betrayed their
origin in the principles which they advocated. We shall have
occasion hereafter to refer to the part taken by Paris university
during the struggle between Philip le Bel and Boniface VIII. That
Pontiff had been prodigal of his favours to the French schools, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
had done more than any preceding Pope to extend their privileges;
yet at the bidding of the crown the Paris doctors did not hesitate to
give their sanction to the monstrous charges by which Philip sought
to blacken the reputation of the man he had resolved to destroy.
They certified to the truth of accusations drawn up at the king’s
direction, representing the Sovereign Pontiff as having a familiar
demon, and as blaspheming the doctrine of the real Presence.
Crevier says one cannot but smile at these articles, which were
notoriously destitute of a shadow of foundation, and in which not
one man who signed them for a moment believed. Yet, he adds,
the university of Paris gave in its adhesion to this act, and her
example was followed by that of Toulouse, <em>because they deemed it
proper to support the authority of the Crown</em>. His own comments on
these facts are not less startling than the facts themselves. “It was
an act,” he says, “of great consequence, and the university has constantly
adhered to this <em>sound</em> doctrine, and made it her greatest glory
that, owing all her privileges to the power of the Popes, she has
never sought to extend their power beyond its just limits, but on the
contrary, has ever been the scourge of theologians and canonists
flattering to the court of Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> In the preface to his work he
lays down this <em>sound doctrine</em> of the university in very plain terms,
which we commend to the attentive study of the reader, as indicating
the inevitable bias of State institutions. “The university of Paris is
intimately united to the State, of which it forms a part. It finds in
the public power that protection which it requires, and acquits itself
of all its duties towards the State by inspiring with all possible care
into the disciples whom it trains the sentiments of citizens and
Frenchmen. This is one of the chief characteristics, I may say, the
peculiar glory, of our university. Its first object is God and religion.
But it knows that God Himself commands us to regard <em>as the first of
duties those which refer to our country and our sovereign</em>, who resumes
all the rights of the nation in his own person. Hence that enlightened
and courageous zeal which has always animated the university
of Paris for the defence of our precious maxims on the independence
of the Crown, the distinction of the two powers, the legitimate rights
of the Head of the Church, and the respective rights of the Church
herself, <em>as opposed to her Head</em>. These maxims, so important to the
tranquillity of Church and State, have always had adversaries, and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
university shares with the Parliament the glory of having ever faithfully
maintained them.”</p>

<p>These words were written in the beginning of the reign of Louis
XVI. Who can regret that an institution, the character of which is
thus depicted by one of its own professors, should have been doomed
to extinction in the midst of that storm which overthrew both state
and monarchy, and taught the terrible lesson how little stability is to
be looked for in any civil power which seeks to base itself on the
“precious maxims” of State supremacy? Yet, this spirit was not
confined to the university of Paris alone; her doctors put it forth,
perhaps, with peculiar boldness and precision, but it was shared by
almost all her sister academies, as may be seen by the part which
the universities of Europe took in the contest between Henry VIII.
and the Holy See, and the active support which he obtained from
their professors. And there is no doubt that this is in great part to
be attributed to the excessive predominance of the study of the
Roman law, which rendered popular a certain Cæsarism in politics,
which eventually proved as destructive to civil, as it did to religious,
liberty.</p>

<p>So far, our observations apply to the universities at all periods
of their existence. But, in the beginning of the thirteenth century,
there existed some dangers peculiar to the time. The new academies
threatened to prove no less hostile to the purity of doctrine
than to the purity of manners. Aggregations of schools incorporated
by royal charters are not the appointed guardians of the deposit of
faith, nor has the promise of infallibility been given to doctors and
theological professors. The monastic scholars had, for the most
part, been secured from error by their reverence for tradition, and
from the fact of their naturally contemplating truth, rather through
the heart, than through the reason. But the new scholastics contemplated
it through the <ins class="corr" id="tn406" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Errata: Page 406, line 10 from bottom, for “logic” read “metaphysics”.">metaphysics</ins> of Aristotle, and, what is more, through
Aristotle as he was rendered by Arabic interpreters, who added to
the errors of the pagan philosophers a pantheistic system of their
own. At the head of these was Averrhoes, the son of an Arabian
physician, whose religion it would be hard to determine, as he
scoffed alike at Christianity, Judaism, and Mahometanism. His
commentaries on Aristotle found such favour in the eyes of the free-thinking
students of the day that they commonly spoke of him as
“the Commentator.” His grand doctrine was that which averred
all mankind to possess but one common intellect. All after death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
were to be united to what the modern Germans would call the <em>Over-Soul</em>,
and hence the dogma of reward and punishment, according to
individual merit, crumbled away, and there was no difference between
saint and sinner&mdash;between St. Peter and Mahomet. These doctrines
were propagated by wandering minstrels, and supported by imperial
scholars. Frederic II. entertained at his court the two sons of
Averrhoes, whose religious views, in the main, coincided with his
own. He patronised the Arabian schoolmen, partly out of a love
of the natural sciences which they cultivated, and partly from a
sympathy with their sceptical philosophy; and his support helped to
set the fashion. Soon the new philosophy linked itself to those
Manichean doctrines, the poison of which was always lurking somewhere
within the fold. Secret societies were formed, the members
of which were bound together by oaths, and were to be found in
most of the great universities; and Bulæus tells us that an organisation
existed for disseminating their opinions among the people by
agents disguised as pedlars. A new translation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics
appeared in 1167, and, says Crevier, “men’s minds became
wholly filled with them.” Many fell into open unbelief, and he
relates the well-known story of Simon of Tournai, who, after explaining
all the doctrines of religion with great applause, blasphemously
boasted that it was as easy for him to disprove, as to prove the
existence of God. He offered to do so on the following day, but,
in the midst of his impious speech, he was struck with apoplexy,
and the event was regarded as a manifestation of the Divine displeasure.</p>

<p>Another of the Paris professors, Amauri de Bene, was regent of
arts about the same time with Simon. He was remarked as being
fond of singular opinions; and as having a way of thinking on most
subjects peculiar to himself, but in his own lifetime the real truth
was never suspected. But after his death startling discoveries were
made. He was found to have been the head of one of the Albigensian
sects who preserved the name of Christianity, while rejecting all
its dogmas. The doctrine of the sacraments was swept away; a
new religion was announced to the initiated as the work of the
Spirit, which was to replace that which had been introduced by the
Son; and this second gospel was associated with hideous immorality.
All this had been cautiously propagated among disciples bound to
secresy by oath. On investigation it proved that the greater number
of the Paris professors were infected with this poison, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
university found itself compelled to limit the number of its doctors
in theology to eight. A council being called at Paris in 1210, it
was resolved to strike at the evil in its head by prohibiting the study
of Aristotle’s Philosophy in the schools. It was in consequence of
this decree that Robert de Courçon in his statutes interdicted the
reading of Aristotle’s Physics and Metaphysics. In 1231 Gregory
IX. rendered the prohibition less absolute, but before the end of the
century a recurrence of the old disorders rendered it once more
necessary to condemn a whole system of pagan errors taught by the
Parisian masters.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> “Even those who did not push the abuse to
such extremes,” says Crevier, “altered, at least in part, the purity
of Christian dogma, by interpretations more conformable to the
principles of Aristotle than of the Fathers.” And it was this that
caused Gregory IX., true friend to ancient learning as he was, to
fulminate a bull against the Paris professors, charging them with
presumptuous arrogance, and forbidding them to mingle their philosophic
opinions with the truths of revelation.</p>

<p>Decrees of this nature were, however, insufficient to meet the evil.
The intellect of Europe, as it flowed into these academies, was
trembling on the brink of infidelity, and so long as the schools of
philosophy were in the enemy’s hands, it was vain to expect to put
down error by the simple voice of authority. What power, then,
was to be evoked in defence of Christian dogma? Where were the
champions to be found to meet the teachers of error on their own
ground, and beat them with their own weapons? The monastic
orders had ever proved the militia of the Church at such crises, but
in the present case their position seemed to preclude their taking a
prominent part in the contest. Though they were beginning to
make use of the universities for the education of their younger
members, yet this was felt by many to be a straining of their rule,
and a very general prejudice against the practice prevailed among
the monks themselves. Certainly it would never have been tolerated
for them to have aspired to the professor’s chair, yet the battle, it
was plain, would have to be fought in the arena of the schools.
Something seemed required in which the spirit of the schools and
of the cloister should be combined; in which all the science of the
one should be united to all the unworldly self-devotedness of the
other. A new institute seemed called for in the Church, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
moment that it was called for, it appeared. The Divine Householder,
bringing out of His treasure-house things new as well as old,
had in His providence prepared the shield which was to cast back
the weapons of the new scholasticism on those who wielded them;
to Christianise the schools, and press philosophy into the service of
the faith. And this gigantic work was to be <ins class="corr" id="tn409" title="Transcriber’s Note—“wrought by the ministry of doctom” changed to “wrought by the ministry of doctors”.">wrought by the ministry of doctors </ins> indeed, but of men who were not merely doctors, but
saints. But of them and of their triumphs we must speak in a
separate chapter.</p>

<p class="pfs90">THE DOMINICANS AND THE UNIVERSITIES.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1215-1300.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the very same year which witnessed the publication of the Paris
Statutes by Robert de Courçon, the city of Toulouse was being
electrified by the lectures of a certain professor of theology named
Alexander, who was held in great esteem throughout the south of
France. One autumn day in the year 1215, having risen at a very
early hour to pursue his studies, he fell asleep in his chair, and in his
sleep he had a dream. He thought that seven stars appeared before
him, small at first, but gradually increasing in size, and at last illuminating
the whole world with their splendour. Starting from his slumber,
he found that the hour had come for him to open his school,
and hastening thither, seven men presented themselves to him as he
entered, and informed him that they were about to preach in the
country round about Toulouse, and desired, before doing so, to attend
his lectures. They wore the usual dress of the Canons Regular of
St. Augustine, namely, a white serge tunic covered with a linen
surplice, and over that a black mantle; and they were headed by one
on whose brow the master seemed to recognise the starry splendour
which he had seen in his late vision: they were Dominic Guzman,
prior of Prouille and Canon of Osma, and his first six followers.</p>

<p>The Order of Preachers was at this time but just founded, but
even before its holy patriarch had given it a rule, and obtained for it
the Apostolic confirmation, he directed its first steps to the schools.
The institute, of which he had conceived the plan, was expressly
designed for the purpose of teaching and preaching, and hence the
culture of sacred science formed, from the first moment of its existence,
one of its primary and essential duties. Having, therefore,
established his followers at Toulouse to pursue their studies under
the direction of Alexander, St. Dominic hastened to Rome to lay his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
plans before Pope Innocent III., then presiding over the Fourth
Lateran Council. The Fathers of that Council had already formally
recognised the grand evils of the age, which cried for a remedy, to be
the want of sound religious instruction among the people and of
theological science among the clergy. And a decree had been passed
directing the bishops in each diocese to choose persons capable of
preaching and instructing the people who were to be employed in
this office; and requiring that certain learned men should be
appointed in all churches, whether cathedral or conventual, to assist
the bishops in preaching the Word of God and administering the
Sacraments. Thus the outline of a teaching and preaching order
had been sketched by the Lateran Fathers even before its perfect
design had been submitted to the Pope by its founder. No wonder,
therefore, that it was readily approved; it appeared as though raised
up by God to supply a want at the very moment when the existence
of that want had been distinctly acknowledged. And as if to mark
the fact that, from the first moment of its formal existence, the Order
of Preachers was expressly intended to teach and cultivate sacred
science, Honorius III., when confirming the rule in the year following,
bestowed upon St. Dominic the office of Master of the Sacred
Palace, which may be briefly defined as that of the Pope’s theologian.
This office became hereditary in the Order, and distinguished the
sons of St. Dominic as the chosen theologians of the Church.</p>

<p>To form a just idea of the solicitude of the holy founder, and of
those who immediately succeeded him, in establishing a perfect
system of studies, we must turn to the Constitutions of the Order.
It was at the first general chapter held at Bologna in 1220, and presided
over by the saint himself, that an ordinance was passed
declaring that as the principal end of the Order is preaching, the
brethren should concern themselves rather with books and studies
than with the singing of Responsories and Antiphons, provided,
however, that prayer be vigilantly attended to.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> And elsewhere the
pursuit of sacred learning is declared to be “most congruous to the
design of the Order,” both because the Order professes the contemplative
life, and the study of sacred things is necessary to this end,
and because it is also designed for teaching others the Divine knowledge
which its members have acquired by learning.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Schools were
therefore to be opened in every convent, under a Master of Studies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
which differed from the old monastic schools in being exclusively
intended as theological seminaries, and not as academies of the arts.
The study of arts was not indeed absolutely prohibited, but it was to
be pursued under limitations, and too much time was not to be given
to secular branches of learning.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It was, however, required that in
all convents the brethren should study the languages of the neighbouring
countries;<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and early in the fourteenth century the study
of the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic tongues was likewise enjoined.
Still later, in 1553, it was ordained that in all convents where there
were younger brethren, there should be a lector appointed to teach
them grammar and the arts, according to their capacity. But the
studies chiefly contemplated by the rule were those of philosophy
and theology. Three years were to be devoted to the study of
philosophy, before the commencement of the theological course.
The length of time devoted to theological studies may be gathered
from the rule which enjoined that in each of the chief houses of
studies there should be a Regent of Studies, a certain number of
Bachelors and Lectors, and a Master of Studies; but no one could
be appointed Regent till he had publicly taught theology for twelve
years, and the Bachelor or Lector, ten years; and all these must have
maintained at least five public disputations in the schools before the
assembled doctors and scholars. Moreover, before any one could
present himself for the examination required in order to become a
Master of Studies, it was necessary to have completed the course of
arts, and another four years’ course of theology.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>During the year of religious probation which preceded profession,
the novices were exclusively to occupy themselves in acquiring a
knowledge of their rule and the duties of their state, and were
exercised in chanting the Divine Office and studying the Ceremonies
of the Order. During this time they were not allowed to engage in
any study except that of languages. After their profession their
scholastic course began, during which time every facility was to be
afforded them for pursuing their philosophical and theological course.
They were to have suitable cells in which they might read, write, and
even sit up at night with a light. There was to be some place in
which the Master of Studies could assemble them to propose doubts
and questions, in discussing which good order and courtesy were to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
be observed. Every student was to be provided with three books;
a Bible, a copy of the Sentences, and a book of histories.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The
studies began with a course of philosophy, then the Scriptures were
explained, and no one could be sent to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Studium Generale</i>, a house
of general studies, until he had passed at least one year under a professor
of the Sacred Scriptures. After this came the explanation of
the Sentences, which formed the theological text-book, until the
works of St. Thomas were substituted in their place. In the schools
the Lector was forbidden to use any written manuscript; he might
have the text of Aristotle and of the Sentences, but no gloss. The
pupils might take written notes if they chose, and if they were able
to do so, though, as they sat on bundles of straw, or at best on
benches without desks, this was not always easy. Most were content
to trust to their memory, and assist it afterwards by repetitions
of the master’s lesson among themselves. Classes were held every
day, and there were weekly and yearly examinations. At first there
was but one <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Studium Generale</i>, that, namely, of St. James’s Convent
in Paris, but in 1248 four others were established at Cologne, Oxford,
Montpelier, and Bologna, in all of which the students were able to
take the same degrees as in Paris. The number of these houses was
afterwards greatly multiplied, one being provided for each province.
Certain scholars of remarkable capacity were selected by their
superiors and sent to those houses. From the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Studium Generale</i> the
students passed on to graduate at some university, unless, as was
often the case, the house was itself aggregated to a university, as at
Paris and Bologna. The order observed at Paris in advancing to the
degree of Doctor, is given by Fleury in his “Fifth Discourse,” and
was as follows. He who was named <em>Bachelor</em> by the General of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
Order, or by the Chapter, began by explaining the Sentences in the
school of some doctor, for the space of a year, at the end of which
time the prior of the convent, with the other doctors then professing,
presented him to the Chancellor of the Church of Paris, and affirmed
on oath that they judged him worthy of obtaining a license to open
a school of his own and teach as a doctor; after going through
certain examinations, he taught the second year in his own school,
and the third year was allowed to have a bachelor under him, whom
at the end of that year he presented for his license. Thus, the
doctor’s course lasted three years, and no one could be raised to the
degree of Doctor of Divinity or Master of Sacred Theology, who had
not thus publicly taught.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The teaching of the Friar Preachers,
however, was not exclusively given in the pulpit or the professor’s
chair. It was their aim to ingraft in men’s minds a knowledge and
love of the truth, to protect them from heresy by informing them
with the spirit of the Church, that spirit which finds expression, not
in her creeds alone, but her Liturgy and sacred ceremonies. In our
own day we have become accustomed to the idea that institutes
founded for the purpose of teaching must necessarily lay aside something
of the monastic character. The long offices, the solemn ceremonial,
the austerities and ritual observances which take up so large
a portion of cloistered life, are, it is thought, difficult, if not impossible,
to associate with the active work of the Apostolate. But in the
thirteenth century men were still deeply penetrated with the Liturgical
spirit which animated the Church in earlier times; it was held
that no words could be so fit to convey her teaching as her own,
and not words alone but acts, the exact performance of her beautiful
rites, made familiar to the eye and heart of the worshipper; her
office, her music, the beauty of her sanctuary, and the silent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
eloquence of her sacred art. All these, therefore, were embraced by
the Dominican rule and used as instruments of popular instruction,
and it is probable that the Friars cherished those privileges which
threw open their churches to the people, and encouraged them to
assist at their public offices, almost equally with those that secured to
them the free possession of the professor’s chair.</p>

<p>How thoroughly the newly-constituted order was fitted to supply
the intellectual wants of the times is proved by the fact, that in the
first period of its existence it was chiefly recruited from the ranks of
university scholars and professors. Among the names that figure in
its early annals those of the Blessed Reginald of Orleans, and St.
Peter Martyr, Jordan of Saxony, and his friend Henry of Cologne,
the Englishman, John of St. Giles, and the Parisian, Vincent of
Beauvais, the three Bolognese doctors Roland, Conrad, and Moneta,
Cardinal Hugh de St. Cher, and his disciple the Blessed Humbert,
with the Spanish canonist St. Raymund Pennafort, were all taken
from this class.</p>

<p>The chief extension of the Order, especially among the students
of Paris and Bologna, took place under the generalship of Blessed
Jordan, who had a remarkable gift of drawing to himself the affection
and confidence of the young. His influence was naturally enough
most powerfully felt among his own countrymen. The convent of
Cologne had already been founded by his old fellow-student and
bosom friend Henry of Utrecht; and a namesake of his, Henry the
German, who had begun life as a student, then assumed the cross,
and finally taking the religious habit, became its first theological
professor. And there in 1230 arrived the young Swabian, Albert of
Lauingen, who had been drawn to the Order by B. Jordan, whilst
pursuing his studies at Padua. Albert during his student-life had
been remarkable for his love of the old classic literature and his
enthusiastic admiration for Aristotle; and had already displayed a
singular attraction to those physical sciences which he afterwards so
profoundly studied. He had examined various natural phenomena,
such as earthquakes, the mephitic vapours issuing from a long
closed well, and some curious marks in a block of marble, which he
explained in a manner which betrays an acquaintance with some of
the chemical theories of modern geology.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> After going through his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
theological course at Bologna, he was appointed to fill the vacant
post of professor at Cologne, where he taught sacred and human
science for some years, and lectured moreover at Hildesheim,
Strasburg, Friburg, and Ratisbonn, in which last city an old hall is
shown which still bears the title of “Albert’s School.” Converted
into a chapel by one of his successors and ardent admirers, it may
be supposed to exhibit the same form and arrangement as that
which it bore five centuries ago. Round the walls are disposed
ancient wooden seats, for the accommodation of the hearers, and
fixed against the middle of the wall is an oak chair, or rather pulpit,
covered with carvings of a later date, representing St. Vincent Ferrer
delivering a lecture, and a novice in the attitude of attention. The
chair is of double construction, containing two seats, in one of
which sat the master, and in the other the bachelor, who explained
under him the Book of the Sentences. All around are texts from
the Holy Scriptures, fitly chosen to remind the student in what
spirit he should apply himself to the pursuit of sacred letters. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ama
scientiam Scripturarum, et vitia carnis non amabis. Qui addit scientiam
addit et laborem. Bonitatem et disciplinam et scientiam doce me. Qui
fecerit et docuerit, hic magnus vocabitur in regno cælorum. Videte ne quis
vos decipiat per philosophiam, secundum elementa mundi, et non secundum
Christum.</i></p>

<p>In such a hall as this we may picture to ourselves the Blessed
Albert the Great lecturing at Cologne in 1245, where he first
received among his pupils that illustrious disciple whose renown,
if it eclipsed his own, at the same time constitutes his greatest
glory. There are few readers who are not familiar with the student
life of St. Thomas of Aquin, the silent habits which exposed him to
the witticisms of his companions, who thought the young Sicilian a
dull sort of importation, and nicknamed him “the dumb ox;” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
obliging compassion which moved a fellow-student to offer him his
assistance in explaining the lessons of the master, and the modesty
and humility with which this greatest of Christian scholars veiled his
mighty intellect, and with the instinct of the saints, rejoiced to be
counted the least among his brethren. But the day came which was
to make him known in his true character. His notes and replies to
a difficult question proposed by Albert from the writings of St.
Denys, fell into the hands of his master, who reading them with
wonder and delight, commanded him on the following day to take
part in the scholastic disputation. St. Thomas obeyed, and the
audience knew not whether most to admire his eloquence or his
erudition. At last Albert, unable to restrain his astonishment,
broke out into the memorable words, “You call this the dumb
ox, but I tell you his roaring will be heard throughout the whole
world.” From that day St. Thomas became the object of his
most solicitous care; he assigned him a cell adjoining his
own, and when in the course of the same year he removed to
Paris, to govern the school of St. James for three years, in order
afterwards to graduate as doctor, he took his favourite scholar with
him.</p>

<p>The position which the Friars at that time occupied in Paris
requires a few words of explanation. In the year 1228, a tavern brawl,
which terminated in a disgraceful riot, had brought on a collision
between the civic and academic authorities; and the indiscriminating
severity with which the excesses of the students had been
punished, had determined all the masters to desert the city, and
open their schools elsewhere. This quarrel, which threatened the
entire break-up of the university, lasted three years, and was only
finally adjusted by the interference of the Pope. During the absence
of the masters, the archbishop and chancellor of Paris conferred one
of the vacant chairs of theology on the Friars Preachers, and shortly
afterwards erected a second chair in their favour, Roland of Cremona
and John of St. Giles being named the two first university professors
of the order.</p>

<p>When the masters returned to Paris they affected to regard this as
an infringement of their rights, and a warm controversy arose, which
lasted with ever-increasing violence for forty years, and was at its
height when the two saints made their first appearance in the Parisian
schools. It did not, however, prevent Albert from winning his
doctor’s cap, together with the reputation of having illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
every branch of science, and of knowing everything that was to be
known.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>His doctor’s triennium had scarcely expired when he was recalled
to Cologne to take the Regency of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Studium Generale</i>, newly
erected in that city; and St. Thomas accompanied him to teach, as
licentiate or bachelor, in the school which proved the germ of a
future university. This epoch of Albert’s life appears to have been
that in which most of his philosophic writings were produced. They
consist chiefly of his “Commentary on Aristotle,” in which, after
collating the different translations of that author with extraordinary
care, he aims at presenting the entire body of his philosophy in a
popular as well as a Christian form; a commentary on the Book of
the Sentences; other commentaries on the Gospels, and on the
works of St. Denys, all of which are preserved; and a devout paraphrase
of the Book of the Sentences cast into the form of prayers,
which has been lost. His published works alone fill twenty one folio
volumes, and it is said that a great number of other treatises exist
in manuscript. Fleury, who is pleased to say that he knows nothing
great about this writer except his volumes, takes in very bad part
the labour he has expended on the study of natural science. The
course of the stars; the structure of the universe; the nature of
plants, animals, and minerals, appear to him unsuitable subjects for
the investigation of a religious man; and he hints that the seculars
who paid for the support of such students by their liberal alms
expected them to spend their time on more profitable studies. The
reader need not be reminded that Albert was not singular in directing
his attention to these subjects, and that the scientific labours of
our own Venerable Bede have ever been considered as among his
best titles to admiration as a scholar. But more than this, it is
surely a narrow and illiberal view to regard the cultivation of science
as foreign to the purposes of religion. At the time of which we are
now speaking, as in our own, physical science was unhappily too
often made an instrument for doing good service to the cause of
infidelity. It was chiefly, if not exclusively, in the hands of the
Arabian philosophers, who had drawn great part of their errors from
the physics of Aristotle. Schlegel, indeed, considers that the extraordinary
popularity of Aristotle in the Middle Ages did not so much
arise from the love of the mediæval schoolmen for his rationalistic
philosophy, as from the attraction they felt to some great and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
mysterious knowledge of nature. His works seemed to give promise
of unlocking to them those vast intellectual treasures reserved for
the scrutiny of our own age, but of the existence of which they possessed
a kind of dim half-consciousness. Hence the teachers of the
thirteenth century could hardly do more effective service to the cause
of truth than by handling these subjects according to a Christian
method, and proving that faith and science were in no sense opposed
to one another. Hallam affects to grieve over the evil inflicted on
Europe by the credit which Albert’s influence gave to the study of
astrology, alchemy, and magic. The author of Cosmos, however,
passes a very different verdict on the nature of his scientific writings,
and one which our readers will be disposed to receive as more
worthy of attention. “Albertus Magnus,” he says, “was equally
active and influential in promoting the study of natural science, and
of the Aristotelian philosophy.... His works contain some exceedingly
acute remarks on the organic structure and physiology of plants.
One of his works, bearing the title of <cite>Liber Cosmographicus de
Natura Locorum</cite>, is a species of physical geography. I have found
in it considerations on the dependence of temperature concurrently
on latitude and elevation, and on the effect of different angles of
incidence of the sun’s rays in heating the ground, which have excited
my surprise.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Jourdain, another modern critic, says, “Whether
we consider him as a theologian or a philosopher, Albert was
undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary men of his age; I might
say, one of the most wonderful men of genius who has appeared in
past times.”</p>

<p>It may be of interest to notice here a few of the scientific views of
Albert, which show how much he owed to his own sagacious observation
of natural phenomena, and how far he was in advance of his
age. He decides that the Milky Way is nothing but a vast assemblage
of stars, but supposes, naturally enough, that they occupy the orbit
which receives the light of the sun. The figures visible on the
moon’s disk are not, he says, as has hitherto been supposed, reflections
of the seas and mountains of the earth, but configurations of
her own surface. He notices, in order to correct it, the assertion of
Aristotle that lunar rainbows appear only twice in fifty years; “I
myself,” he says, “have observed two in a single year.” He has
something to say on the refraction of the solar ray, notices certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
crystals which have a power of refraction, and remarks that none of
the ancients, and few moderns, were acquainted with the properties
of mirrors. In his tenth book, wherein he catalogues and describes
all the trees, plants, and herbs known in his time, he observes, “all
that is here set down is the result of our own experience, or has
been borrowed from authors, whom we know to have written what
their personal experience has confirmed: for in these matters experience
alone can give certainty.” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Experimentum solum certificat
talibus.</i>) Such an expression, which might have proceeded from the
pen of Bacon, argues in itself a prodigious scientific progress, and
shows that the mediæval friar was on the track so successfully pursued
by modern natural philosophy. He had fairly shaken off the shackles
which had hitherto tied up discovery, and was the slave neither of
Pliny nor of Aristotle.</p>

<p>He treats as fabulous the commonly-received idea, in which Bede
had acquiesced, that the region of the earth south of the equator
was uninhabitable, and considers that, from the equator to the south
pole, the earth was not only habitable, but, in all probability, actually
inhabited, except directly at the poles, where he imagines the cold
to be excessive. If there are any animals there, he says, they must
have very thick skins to defend them from the rigour of the climate,
and are probably of a <em>white colour</em>. The intensity of cold is, however,
tempered by the action of the sea. He describes the antipodes
and the countries they comprise, and divides the climate of the earth
into seven zones. He smiles with a scholar’s freedom at the simplicity
of those who suppose that persons living at the opposite region
of the earth must fall off&mdash;an opinion which can only arise out of
the grossest ignorance, “for, when we speak of the <em>lower</em> hemisphere
this must be understood merely as relatively to ourselves.” It is as
a geographer that Albert’s superiority to the writers of his own time
chiefly appears. Bearing in mind the astonishing ignorance which
then prevailed on this subject, it is truly admirable to find him
correctly tracing the chief mountain chains of Europe, with the
rivers which take their source in each, remarking on portions of
coast which have in later times been submerged by the ocean, and
islands which have been raised, by volcanic action, above the level
of the sea, noticing the modification of climate caused by mountains,
seas, and forests; and the divisions of the human race, whose
differences he ascribes to the effect of the countries they inhabit.
In speaking of the British Isles, he alludes to the commonly-received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
idea that another distant island, called Tile or Thule, existed far in
the Western Ocean, uninhabitable by reason of its frightful climate,
but which, he says, has perhaps not yet been visited by man. He
was acquainted with the sleep of plants, with the periodical opening
and closing of blossoms, with the diminution of sap during evaporation
from the cuticle of the leaves, and with the influence of the
distribution of the bundles of vessels on the folial indentations.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
His minute observations on the forms and variety of plants intimate
an exquisite sense of floral beauty. He distinguishes the star from
the bell flower, tells us that a red rose will turn white when submitted
to the vapour of sulphur, and makes some very sagacious observations
on the subject of germination. The extraordinary erudition
and originality of this treatise has drawn from M. Meyer the following
comment:&mdash;“No botanist who lived before Albert can be compared
to him, unless it be Theophrastus, with whom he was not
acquainted; and after him none has painted nature in such living
colours, or studied it so profoundly, until the time of Conrad, Gesner,
and Cesalpini. All honour, then, to the man who made such
astonishing progress in the science of nature as to find no one, I will
not say to surpass, but even to equal him for the space of three
centuries.”</p>

<p>In the Treatise on Animals which Jourdain particularly praises,
nineteen books are a paraphrase of Michael Scott’s translation of
Aristotle, but the remaining seven books are Albert’s own, and form,
says Jourdain a precious link between ancient and modern science.
It was not extraordinary that one who had so deeply studied nature,
and had mastered so many of her secrets, should by his wondering
contemporaries have been judged to have owed his marvellous
knowledge to a supernatural source, or that his mechanical contrivances,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
his knowledge of the power of mirrors, and his production
of a winter garden, or hothouse, where, on the feast of the Epiphany
1249, he exhibited to William of Holland, king of the Romans,
plants and fruit-trees in full blossom, should have subjected him in
the mind of the vulgar to the suspicion of sorcery. But it is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
surprising that such charges should be reproduced by modern critics,
who, it might have been thought, would have condemned the very
belief in witchcraft as a mediæval superstition. The more so as
Albert devotes no inconsiderable portion of his pages to the
exposure and refutation of those forbidden arts, which he will not
allow to be reckoned among the sciences, such as geomancy, chiromancy,
and a formidable list of other branches of magic.</p>

<p>During the time that Albert was engaged in these labours, his
daily life was one which might rather have seemed that of a
contemplative than of a student of physical science. “I have seen,
and know of a truth,” says his disciple Thomas of Cantimpré, “that
the venerable Albert, whilst for many years he daily lectured on
theology, yet watched day and night in prayer, daily recited the
entire Psalter, and at the conclusion of every lesson and disputation
gave himself up to Divine contemplation.” His skill as a master
drew an incredible number of students to Cologne, whom he not
only inspired with his own love of science, but directed in the
spiritual life. Among these were the blessed Ambrose of Siena, and
Ulrich of Engelbrecht, who afterwards became provincial of Germany,
and made use of the mechanical and scientific lore he had acquired
from his master in the construction of the great organ in Strasburg
cathedral.</p>

<p>But the fame of all the other pupils of Albert pales like his own
before that of St. Thomas of Aquin, who claims our notice in these
pages less in his character of saint and theologian than in that of
Regent of schools. From the period of his promotion to the
doctorate to the day of his death, he was incessantly engaged in the
work of teaching, as a very brief outline of his life will show. After
lecturing for four years in Cologne, he was recalled to Paris in order
to take his degrees, and though under the accustomed age, for he
was then but twenty-five, no opposition was offered on the part of
the university to his being received as Bachelor, and lecturing as
such in the public schools. But at the end of the year, when he
should, by right, have proceeded to the degree of Doctor, the quarrel
which had already broken out between the Seculars and Regulars was
fanned into a flame by the calumnies of William de St. Amour, and
the secular Regents persisted in refusing to admit the friars to any
of the theological chairs. The dispute being at last referred to Rome,
St. Thomas was summoned thither, and by his eloquent defence
procured the condemnation of St. Amour’s book on “The Perils of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
the Latter Times,” in which the religious orders were attacked in
scandalous terms. Not only were the deputies of the university
obliged to subscribe this condemnation, but also to promise on oath,
in presence of the cardinals, to receive members of the two mendicant
orders to their academic degrees, and especially St. Bonaventure
and St. Thomas, who had hitherto been unable to obtain their
Doctor’s caps. The publication of the Pope’s bull, and the authority
of St. Louis, finally brought this vexatious dispute to a close, but the
university authorities, though forced to yield, contrived to give expression
to their ill-will by an act which provided that the Dominicans
should always hold the last place, not only after the secular regents,
but after those of every other religious body.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>On the 23rd of October, 1257, the two saints were received to
their Doctor’s degree. St. Thomas, who had no small difficulty in
overcoming the scruples of his humility, and who only yielded at last
to the orders of his superiors, chose for the text of his “Act of
Theology,” not as it would appear without a divine inspiration, the
words of the Psalmist, “Thou waterest the hills from Thy upper
rooms; the earth shall be filled with the fruit of Thy works;”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> words
which he interpreted to refer to Jesus Christ, who, as the Head of
men and angels, waters the heavenly mountains with the torrent of
His graces, and fills the Church with the fruit of His works, in the
Sacraments which convey to us the merits of His Passion. But as
Père Croiset observes, the event gave to this text the character of a
prophecy regarding his own future career.</p>

<p>Having taken his Doctor’s degree, he now, according to custom,
taught in his own school, having under him a bachelor, who appears
to have been either Annibal Annibali, his particular friend, and afterwards
cardinal, or Peter Tarantasio, afterwards Pope Innocent V.
Many of his theological works were composed during the time he
was teaching at Paris, and among the rest his “Summa against the
Gentiles,” written at the particular request of St. Raymond Pennafort.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
Father Nicholas Marsillac, one of his disciples, who gave evidence
at the process of his canonisation, speaking of his extreme love of
poverty, declared that when he was composing this work, he was often
in want of paper to write it on. Nor were his charity and humility
less remarkable than his spirit of detachment. In the arena of
disputation, where the desire to be right, and the shame of appearing
wrong, are apt enough to elicit warm feelings and sharp words, those
who watched him the most closely never saw his tranquillity for one
moment disturbed;<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> master of himself and of his passions, he possessed
his soul in meekness and patience.</p>

<p>On the death of Alexander IV., in 1261, his successor, Urban IV.,
summoned St. Thomas to Rome, where he continued to discharge
the same functions as at Paris, and composed a great number of his
theological treatises. It was also during this period of his life that
he visited England, being present as Definitor to the General Chapter,
held at the Blackfriars in London, in the year 1263. Immediately
on his return he was called to Orvieto, and charged by Urban to
draw up an office for the newly-appointed Feast of Corpus Christi.
“What chiefly strikes us in this office,” says Dom Guéranger,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> “is the
grand scholastic form which it presents. Each of the Responsories
at Matins is composed of two sentences, one drawn from the Old,
and the other from the New Testament, which are thus made to
render their united testimony to the great mystery which is the object
of the Feast. This idea, which has in it something truly great, was
unknown to St. Gregory and the other authors of the ancient liturgy.
But St. Thomas possessed the genius not only of a theologian, but
of a poet. In his prose <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lauda Sion</i>, as the same writer observes, he
has found means to unite scholastic precision to poetry, and even to
rhyme. For,” he adds, “every sentiment of order necessarily resolves
itself into harmony, and hence, St. Thomas, the most perfect scholastic
of the thirteenth century, is on that very account its most
sublime poet.” About the same time he appears to have composed
his Treatise on the “Unity of the Intellect,” against the errors of
Averrhoes; at least it is known to have been written during the
pontificate of Urban IV., who died in 1264.</p>

<p>Clement IV., who succeeded him, showed himself no less sensible
of the merits of the great doctor than his predecessor had been. He
wished to have raised him to the archbishopric of Naples, and even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
published a Bull conferring that dignity on him, but the prayer of
the saint induced him to suppress it, being unwilling, by persisting
in his design, to afflict one so dear to him. St. Thomas was therefore
left in peace, and he used his liberty to commence his great work,
“The Summa of Theology,” of which John XXII. is reported to have
said, that if the author had worked no other miracle, he might be
deemed to have worked as many as there were articles in the book.
Tolomeo of Lucca says, that it was begun in the year 1265, and that
the saint devoted to it the remaining nine years of his life, during
which time, however, he never ceased to preach and teach publicly
both at Rome, Bologna, and Naples. At Bologna, in particular, his
lectures caused a sort of revival of learning in that city, and drew
thither a great number of foreigners. He remained there for three
years, at the end of which time he was called to Paris to attend the
General Chapter of his order, and, according to Echard, was again
raised to the professor’s chair in that university, which he filled for
two years. On his return to Bologna, in 1271, the publication of the
second part of his “Summa” produced such an excitement that all
the universities of Europe disputed which should gain possession of
him. Naples won the preference, and thither the saint repaired,
passing on his way through Rome, where he began the third part of
his “Summa” and lectured in public according to his custom. A
contemporary writer, quoted by the Bollandists, affirms that being
engaged in explaining the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the waxlight,
which he held in his fingers, burnt down and scorched them without
his being conscious of the pain, so entirely was he absorbed in the
greatness of his subject.</p>

<p>At Naples he found a very different state of things from that
which had prevailed there when he had studied as a youth in the
Ghibbeline university of Frederic II. The rule and the race of that
emperor had passed away like a dream, and the kingdom of the
Two Sicilies was now held by Charles of Anjou, the brother of
St. Louis, and the faithful supporter of the rights of the Holy See.
He reckoned it among the glories of his reign to have drawn to his
capital the greatest doctor of the Church; and an inscription
engraved on marble was long to be seen at the entrance of the school
of the Dominican Convent at Naples, bidding the visitor, before
entering, do reverence to the chair whence St. Thomas had taught
an infinite number of disciples, King Charles I. having procured this
happiness for his kingdom and assigned an ounce of gold per month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
for the support of the said doctor. During the year and a half that
he resided at Naples, St. Thomas continued his accustomed labours;
only during the three last months of his life did he lay aside his pen,
and cease to write or dictate.</p>

<p>It appeared as though he were conscious of his approaching
end, for which God was preparing him by astonishing revelations.
Often he was rapt in ecstasies at the altar, concerning which, when
questioned, he could only answer, “So great are the things that have
been revealed to me, that all I have hitherto taught and written
seems to me as nothing.” Yet he was able, before his death, to complete
the third part of the Summa, which he left in the state in
which we still possess it, and besides this to compose several other
lesser treatises. On his deathbed, as is well known, his humility
yielded to the entreaties of the religious who surrounded him,
and he consented to explain to them the Canticle of canticles.
His dying words, as they are reported by the Bollandists, are
precious as the last instruction of the greatest of Christian scholars.
When he beheld the Sacred Host in the hands of the priest who was
about to administer to him the last sacraments, he made his profession
of faith according to the accustomed form. Then he added, “I
have written much, and have often disputed on the mysteries of Thy
law, O my God! Thou knowest I have desired to teach nothing
save what I have learnt from Thee. If what I have written be true,
accept it as a homage to Thine Infinite Majesty; if it be false,
pardon my ignorance. I consecrate all I have ever done to Thee,
and submit all to the infallible judgment of Thy Holy Roman
Church, in whose obedience I am about to depart this life.”</p>

<p>It will be seen that the career of St. Thomas was exclusively that
of a scholastic professor, and the anecdotes left us by his biographers
prove with what a hearty and genuine earnestness he devoted himself
to the cause of sacred learning. His prodigious powers of mind
were accompanied with a childlike simplicity of character, which has
been recognised by every writer of his life, and which, no less than
the purity of his doctrine, won him the title of the Angelic Doctor.
In the schools he was known as the sweetest and most charitable,
as well as the most learned, of masters; no harsh word was ever
heard to pass his lips, and the youngest of his scholars could reckon
on commanding his whole attention. He had no thoughts apart
from his religions duties and his books; and the splendours of the
courts of France and Naples, in both of which he was received with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
such distinguished honour, had no power to dazzle him. Seated at
the table of St. Louis, he was absorbed in a convincing argument
against the Manicheans, and became wholly forgetful of the royal
presence; and at Naples his student-like absence of mind was not
less conspicuous. When the cardinal legate and the Archbishop of
Capua came to visit him, he descended into the cloister to receive
them; but on the way, revolving in his mind the solution of a
theological difficulty, became so absorbed in his subject that by the
time he reached the cloister he had forgotten all about the business
and the visitors that had called him thither, and stood like one in a
dream. The archbishop, who had formerly been his pupil, persuaded
the cardinal to leave him alone till he should have recovered himself,
and assured him that these reveries were perfectly well understood
by those familiar with his habits.</p>

<p>F. Daniel d’Agusta once pressed him to say what he considered the
greatest grace he had ever received from God, sanctifying grace, of
course, excepted. He replied, after a few moments’ reflection, “I
think, that of having understood whatever I have read.” St.
Antoninus says, in his life, that no doubt was ever proposed to him
that he did not solve, and that he remembered everything he had
once heard, so that his mind was like a huge library. He often
wrote, dictating at the same time on other subjects to three or four
secretaries. Erveo Britto, one of these secretaries, declared that on
one occasion the saint becoming weary, closed his eyes and appeared
to have fallen asleep, but that in this state he nevertheless continued
to dictate as before.</p>

<p>There are few saints, in fact, of whose daily life and habits we
know more than St. Thomas. He is familiar to us as one of ourselves.
We seem to see him enjoying his ordinary recreation of
walking up and down the cloister of his convent, occasionally dragged
off by his brethren to take a breath of fresh air in the garden, but
sure in such cases to be found before long in some remote corner,
absorbed in cogitation. Or we behold him contentedly following a
lay brother through the markets of Bologna, who, ignorant of the
rank of the new guest in the convent, had summoned him to be his
companion on the quest, and charged him with the bag, which he
carried all day on his shoulder, with undisturbed good-humour.
His clothes were always the poorest in the whole convent, and his
love of poverty was so great, that we are told that he wrote his
“Summa against the Gentiles” on old letters and other scraps of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
paper. He ate but once in the day, and his total indifference to
comfort or convenience, seemed to indicate that he had been heard,
in what is said to have been his daily prayer for detachment: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Da
mihi, Domine, cor nobile, quod nulla deorsum trahat terrena affectio.</i>
And with these homely anecdotes are mingled others which exhibit
him to us in ecstasy before his crucifix, preparing himself for his daily
celebration of Mass by penance, confession, and meditation, and
making his thanksgiving by humbly serving another, feeding his
devotion by acts of charity, and binding himself by a law never to
admit into his soul a single thought that should not be directed to
God.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>In the last chapter we have seen something of the ravages caused
by that pagan philosophy which had gradually established itself in
the schools, and without some knowledge of which it is impossible
to appreciate the work accomplished by St. Thomas. The university
professors of the thirteenth century regarded Aristotle much as the
masters of Carthage had done, of whom St. Augustine says that they
spoke of the Categories of that philosopher with their cheek bursting
with pride, as of something altogether divine. To displace a system
which had obtained so firm a hold of the European mind, would
probably have been a hopeless enterprise, and St. Thomas therefore
achieved his triumph in another way. He humbled the proud Agar,
Reason, under the hand of her mistress, Faith, and presented the truths
of Revelation in the language of philosophy. In the five volumes
which he devoted to his Commentaries on Aristotle he purged the
text of the pagan philosopher from everything opposed to the truths
of Christianity, and in his Summa of Theology he used the Aristotelian
system of reasoning to combine those truths in one vast and
harmonious whole.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Far from depreciating the office of the understanding,
he vindicated its rights, by proving how close an alliance
existed between Faith and Reason, and drove from the field the
pantheistic dreams of Averrhoes by defining the nature and powers
of the individual intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span></p>

<p>The Arabian philosopher had attempted to explain the existence of
universal ideas as found alike in all minds, by the hypothesis that
mankind had but one common intellect, and that their ideas were
therefore the creation not of many intellects, but of one. His view
was embraced by many of the schoolmen, and carried to its extremest
consequences, so that it was not uncommon to hear it asserted that
after death all souls were merged in one, and thus that all distinction
of rewards and punishments would be impossible.</p>

<p>“St. Thomas fought the new sceptical school with their own
weapons; with the Conceptualists he admitted the axiom that the
mind is the creator of its own objects:<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> by its own powers it forms
its ideas of external things; yet its ideas are no false representations
of the external world, for the matter of these ideas has been
furnished from without by the senses.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> There was, therefore, no
necessity for imagining such a oneness of intellect as Averrhoes held,
in order to give objective certainty to human knowledge. The
intellect of each man has its own powers, and is the image of the
Everlasting Wisdom; and its ideas are shadows of the archetypal
ideas of the Divine mind, according to which the world was created.
Limited as are its powers, by looking on itself it can form a notion
of God, which, though feeble and inadequate, is capable of being
developed by the Church on earth, and more perfectly still in heaven.
The Pantheism of Averrhoes was nothing but the perversion of a
great truth. There is, indeed, one Light ‘which lighteneth every
man who cometh into the world,’ but the intellect of each man is a
substantive thing with its own powers and operations. Moreover,
Averrhoes had removed the intellect utterly out of the control of the
conscience; according to him and his disciples the doctrines of faith
and the conclusions of reason were the direct contradictory to each
other; nevertheless, both might exist together in the mind without
the necessity of coming to any conclusion. In other words, they
believed in nothing whatever; and truth was a mere matter of words.
St. Thomas, therefore, set himself to place faith and reason in right
relations to each other. The intellect, he said, was a sacred gift of
God, and could never be really contrary to the truth.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In its own
sphere it was perfect, but the field of faith was a vast system lying
beyond the sphere of the intellect. It was out of the jurisdiction of
the reason which could pronounce nothing on the matter. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
though powerless as an organ for the discovery of the faith, it may
serve as an expression of the doctrines of revelation. Faith no more
excludes reason than grace excludes nature,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and Divine truths
when received into the human mind, must take the shape of human
ideas and human words. Therefore it was that St. Thomas conceived
it possible that the great truths of revelation might be expressed in
terms of reason, and that the faith might be systematised and
presented as one vast whole. And to effect this he chose the terms
of Aristotle’s philosophy, as the most scientific classification of the
ideas of the human mind.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The mind of Europe, which had been fast lapsing into infidelity,
found itself at last in possession of a system of Christian philosophy
wherein the Aristotelian dialectics were employed to defend the
Catholic dogmas. “In the Summa of Theology was presented,” says
Ozanam, “a vast synthesis of the moral sciences, in which was
unfolded all that could be known of God, of man, and of their
mutual relations,&mdash;a truly Catholic philosophy.” The value of such a
gift, at such a time, was at once apprehended, and so instantaneously
was the doctrine of St. Thomas accepted in the schools of his own
order, that only four years after his death we find a decree of the
general chapter of Milan directing that certain English friars should
be severely punished for having departed from his teaching, and
having had the temerity to call in question some of his propositions.
Before the end of the century decrees were passed<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> expressly
requiring all the brethren to adhere to the doctrine which he taught,
without allowing the least departure from it, and this even before
his canonisation. But it was not his own order alone which thus
adopted his teaching, and bore witness to his position as a Doctor
of the Church. That very university of Paris, which in 1255 had
refused him his Doctor’s cap in 1259, agreed to refer to his sole
decision a theological question of deep interest, regarding the
Sacramental species which then agitated the schools; and in 1274
addressed a letter to the Chapter-General of the Order, in which it
speaks of the consternation into which the schools of the metropolis
have been cast by the news of his death. They know not where
to find expressions honourable enough by which to designate him;
he is the morning star, the luminous sun, the light of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
Church. They remind the Fathers how vehemently they had
desired to have him restored to them, and beg that they may now at
least be permitted to have his ashes. Two years after his canonisation,
certain students in arts having revived some of the philosophical
errors refuted by St. Thomas, Stephen, Bishop of Paris, immediately
issued a letter, condemning every article which seemed to affect
“the doctrine of that most excellent Doctor, the Blessed Thomas,”
whom he calls “the great luminary of the Catholic Church, the
precious stone of the priesthood, the flower of Doctors, and the bright
mirror of the university of Paris.” The universities of Bologna,
Padua, Naples, Toulouse, Salamanca, Alcala, and Louvain, at
various times and in various ways formally declared their adhesion
to his doctrine, as did also a great number of the religious orders,
enumerated by Touron in his life of the saint.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> And even during
the lifetime of the saint, as Echard remarks,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> the numerous disciples
whom he had trained in his school, carried his teaching into the
universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Bologna, Rome, and Cologne, for
so great was the authority which his name enjoyed, that they seldom
made use of any other commentaries than those of their master.</p>

<p>The character of St. Thomas is commonly regarded as presenting
us with the perfect model of a Christian doctor. The ideal of such
a character has been sketched by his own pen in that commentary
on St. Matthew’s Gospel, wherein he reminds the reader that it is
not enough for the scholar to study the truths of religion, if he does
not draw near to God in his life. For God is the source of light,
whom if we approach by faith and charity we shall be truly
illuminated, and it is by a holy life rather than by subtlety of reasoning
that we must seek for a knowledge of the truth. There is a
light which men may gain by study, but it suffices not to fill the soul;
and there is a light which God pours out on those who sanctify
study with prayer, and this is the true wisdom; according to the
words of the Wise Man&mdash;“I called upon God, and the spirit of
wisdom came upon me.” The perfect Doctor, therefore, he continues,
is he whose life, as well as whose doctrine, is light. Three
things are necessary to him: stability, that he may never deviate
from the truth; clearness, that he may teach without obscurity; and
purity of intention, that he may seek God’s glory, and not his own.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
The life and the writings of St Thomas verified his own words.
“The most learned of the saints,” said Cardinal Bessarion, “he was
also the holiest among the learned.” He has himself expressed the
guiding principle of his scholastic career in a passage which we may
be permitted to quote here for the edification of all scholars. It
occurs in his Summa against the Gentiles, wherein he attempts to
define the office of the true philosopher, and shows that, even
according to Aristotle, the only real philosophy is the science of
truth. But, if truth is to be held, error must be refuted; hence,
the office of the wise man is twofold&mdash;to meditate on the divine
truths, and to combat all errors opposed to them. “Encouraged,
therefore, by the divine goodness to undertake this office, albeit the
enterprise is far beyond my powers, my intention is, according to my
scanty measure, to manifest the truth professed by the Catholic faith,
and to eliminate the contrary errors; for to use the words of St.
Hilary, I feel and am persuaded that the chief duty of my life which
I owe to God is, in all my words, as in all my thoughts, to speak
His praise.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>What an earnest loyalty to God breathes forth in these words!
What a deep conviction of the oneness of philosophy with divine
dogma! What a majesty of resolve in his determination to make
the manifestation of Catholic truth the “duty of his life,” and how
rare a picture of lifelong purpose nobly achieved when we compare
these expressions with his dying words!&mdash;“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sumo Te pretium
redemptionis animæ meæ, sumo Te viaticum peregrinationis animæ
meæ; pro cujus amore studui, vigilavi et laboravi, prædicavi et docui;
nihil unquam contra Te dixi; sed si quid dixi ignorans, non sum
pertinax in sensu meo. Totum relinquô correctioni Sanctæ Romanæ
Ecclesiæ, in cujus obedientia nunc transeo ex hac vita.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The reconciliation of revealed truth and philosophy to which St.
Thomas devoted his life must doubtless be regarded as the great
intellectual triumph of the thirteenth century; and when we contemplate
the group of illustrious men who took part in that work, it is
impossible not to render homage to the good providence of God, who,
in the hour of need, supplies His Church with fit instruments with
which to effect His own purposes. The Friar Minors shared with
the Friar Preachers the toils and glory of this great enterprise. Their
order had not, indeed, been founded with the same express view of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
cultivating sacred science; but they were required to labour for the
salvation of souls, and as souls could only be saved at this crisis by
the vigorous defence of Catholic dogma, the humble sons of St.
Francis scrupled not to enter the university schools, and soon gave
to the Church a long line of doctors. The seraphic St. Bonaventure
was bound to St. Thomas in the ties of friendship, and intimately
associated with him in his work; and his teaching regarding the
office of the human intellect, and the source of its illumination, is
homogeneous with his. “All illumination descends to man,” he says,
“from God, the Fontal Light: all human science emanates, as from
its source, from the Divine light.” This light, he goes on to say, is
fourfold&mdash;there is the inferior, the exterior, the interior, and the
superior light. The first gives us the knowledge of those things
manifested by the senses. The second illuminates us in respect of
artificial forms, and includes a knowledge of the useful and ornamental
arts, even those of the loom and the needle.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The third is
the light of philosophical knowledge, and its object is intelligible
truth; and this is threefold, for there are three kinds of verities&mdash;truth
of language, truth of things, and truth of morals. Lastly,
superior truth is that of grace and holy Scripture, and illuminates
us in respect of saving truth. “Thus, the fourfold light descending
from above has yet six differences, which set forth so many degrees
of human science. There is the light of sensitive knowledge, the
light of the mechanical arts, the light of rational philosophy, of natural
philosophy, and of moral philosophy, and lastly, the light of grace
and holy Scripture. And so there are six illuminations in this life
of ours, and they have a setting, because all this knowledge shall be
destroyed. And therefore there succeedeth to them the seventh day
of rest, which hath no setting, and that is the illumination of glory.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>It is obviously beyond our present purpose to attempt anything
like an account of the Dominican theologians who succeeded St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
Thomas, and were formed in his school; and I shall content myself,
therefore, with noticing a few of those friars of the thirteenth century,
whose influence may be said to have told on education rather than
on theology. And the first who claims our attention as having distinguished
himself in this line, is, naturally, the librarian of the good king
St. Louis, and the tutor of his children, Vincent of Beauvais. He
devoted a great part of his life to a gigantic undertaking, the very
conception of which attests the colossal scale on which men of those
days thought and laboured for futurity. He desired to facilitate the
pursuit of learning by collecting into one work everything useful to
be known. The plan was not a new one; many such Encyclopædias
had already been produced, as that of St. Isidore, and their value
was great in an age when the scarcity of books rendered it next to
impossible for any ordinary student to procure all the authors he
would require to consult, if he desired to perfect himself in various
sciences. But it is also possible that a more profound motive than
that of mere convenience induced so many of the Christian writers
to spend their labours on these encyclopædiac collections. They
desired to present to the student the idea of knowledge as a whole,
the parts of which were intimately connected, and could not be dissevered
from one another without mutual injury. By philosophy,
they understood a knowledge of truth in all its parts; and hence the
student, according to the old established system, was steadily led
through his trivium and quadrivium, those seven liberal arts selected
as representing the chief divisions of philosophy, properly so called.
The scholastics of Abelard’s stamp had revolutionised this system,
and, as we have seen, had all but banished the arts from the school,
and made philosophy to consist in little more than the science of
reasoning. And this was one point on which Hugo of St. Victor
attacked them. Bred up in the old school of monastic students, he
contended that their philosophy was no philosophy at all, and that
the seven liberal arts cohered one with another, so that, if one were
wanting, philosophy, which consisted in a comprehensive knowledge
of all science,&mdash;rational, physical, and moral,&mdash;must necessarily be
imperfect.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The same teaching is implied in the passage from St.
Bonaventure, quoted above; and it seems probable that this sound
view of the intimate connection of all parts of human knowledge
flowing, as separate streams, from One Fontal source, prompted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
Vincent of Beauvais to undertake his gigantic work, that so the great
edifice of science should be once more presented with all its halls
and porticoes forming one harmonious whole, <em>domed</em> over, if we
may so express ourselves, with Theology, and surmounted by the
Cross.</p>

<p>He had some special facilities for carrying out his design which
were not at the command of ordinary students. He was able to
make free use of that noble library collected by St. Louis, and
attached by him to the Sainte Chapelle. It was thence that he
drew the materials of his work, and nature had endowed him with
exactly the kind of genius which his task demanded. Antoine
Poissevin says of him that he was a man who was never tired of
reading, writing, teaching, and learning; the most gigantic labours
did not alarm him; neither work, watching, nor fasting was ever
known to cause him fatigue; and after devoting one-half of his life
to reading the royal library, and every other collection of books that
came within his reach, he did not shrink from employing the other
in producing a compendium of all he had read. He limited himself
to no one subject, or section of subjects; but resolved to embrace
all arts and all sciences, whatever he found that was beautiful and true
in the physical or in the moral world; whatever could make known
the wonders of nature, or the yet greater wonders of grace; all that
poets, philosophers, historians, or divines had said that was worth
remembering&mdash;all this he determined to set before his reader in
orderly arrangement; and undismayed at the magnitude of his
enterprise, he laboured at it day and night till it was accomplished.
“The Great Mirror,” as he calls his work, is divided into three parts,
in which are treated separately, Nature, Doctrine, and History. All
his scientific and philosophic views are not, of course, original, for
he proposed rather to give to the world the cream of other men’s
thoughts than of his own. But for this very reason the statements
contained in his book are of greater value, as they show the shallowness
of those charges so continually brought against the science of
the Middle Ages, by writers who have probably concerned themselves
very little to ascertain in what that science consisted. Vincent did
not write to support new theories or explain away vulgar errors; he
aimed only at presenting, in a compendious form, the commonly-received
views of his own time, and of times anterior to his own,
occasionally illustrating his subject with a sagacious remark, derived
from reflection or personal observation. And what a host of misconceptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
and traditional calumnies fall to pieces, as we glance
through such an analysis of his pages as is given by Rohrbacher!<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
How then, we exclaim, did not the mediæval <em>savants</em> oscillate
between the opinion that the earth was a flat plane, and that other
equally luminous view, that it was a cube? Is it possible that they
knew anything of the principle of the attraction of gravitation, and
stranger still, that they explained the spherical form of the earth by
reasoning drawn from that very principle? Are we to believe our
eyes when we read that Vincent of Beauvais illustrates this part of
his subject by reminding us of the globular form of the rain drops,
which he says, in language which reads like an anticipation of the
verses of Montgomery, are so formed by the very same law as that
which regulates the shape of the earth?</p>

<p>And who would expect to find the librarian of St. Louis putting
forth the argument which still does good service in our popular class-books,
wherein the spherical form of the earth is demonstrated by
the gradual disappearance below the horizon of the hull and sails of
a receding ship, and their as gradual reappearance in a contrary
order, on its approach towards us? Yet there it is, together with
yet more learned things; such as the method for measuring an arc
of the meridian as a means of obtaining the circumference of the
earth, quoted from the writings of Gerbert. His treatment of the
metaphysical questions which occupied so much attention at the time
at which he wrote, is no less remarkable than his natural philosophy,
and Rohrbacher, comparing his explanation of <em>universal ideas</em> with
that of Bossuet, gives the preference in point of profundity to the
mediæval friar. “Thus, then,” he continues, “by the middle of the
thirteenth century, the religious of St. Dominic and St. Francis had
resumed all Christian doctrine, the teaching of the Scriptures, the
Fathers, and the Councils into a sum of theology; St. Thomas had
examined in detail the pagan philosophy, had corrected it, and
reconciled it with Christian truth. Roger Bacon, the Franciscan,
not content with the ancient sciences catalogued by Aristotle, had
begun to penetrate deeper into the secrets of nature, and the
Dominican, Vincent of Beauvais, presented in his ‘Mirror’ an
epitome of all that man, up to that time, knew in nature, science,
art, philosophy, and history.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Even had the benefits conferred by the friars on the world of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
letters stopped here, they would have done very much to counteract
that narrowing tendency which has been noticed in the last
chapter and to restore the broader and truer theory of
<ins class="corr" id="tn437" title="Transcriber’s Note—“education which in the twelth” changed to “education which in the twelfth”.">education which in the twelfth</ins> century had been gradually pushed out of place.
But to complete our idea of the work achieved by the Dominicans,
we must add that they largely encouraged the cultivation of Biblical
studies, and of the Greek and Oriental tongues. The Cardinal
Hugh de St. Cher claims the gratitude of students as the author
of the first Biblical Concordance, a work which he commenced in
the year 1236. The Chapter-General of the Order, which was that
year held in Paris, entered with large liberality into so useful a
design, and appointed a great number of the brethren to labour at
it under his direction. Martene, in his <cite>Thesaurus Anecdotorum</cite>,
gives an ordinance of the Chapter of Paris, directing that all copies
of the Sacred Scriptures used in the Order should be revised, corrected,
and punctuated according to the correction of the body of
religious thus employed. This great work was begun under the
generalship, and with the hearty concurrence, of Blessed Jordan of
Saxony; his successor St. Raymund Pennafort, whose election
had been mainly brought about through the exertions of Hugh de
St. Cher, made yet more important provision for the encouragement
of the Scriptural sciences. With a view of promoting the critical
study of the Scriptures, and arming his brethren with weapons of
controversy against the Jews and Mahometans, whose influence in
this century was far more powerfully felt among Christians than it
now is, he established Arabic and Hebrew studies in all the convents
of Spain. Not content with this, he founded two colleges more
expressly intended for the same purpose, attached to convents of
the Order, one at Murcia, and the other at Tunis, filling them with
religious whom he selected as best qualified to devote themselves to
these pursuits. One of these was his celebrated namesake, Raymund
Martin, the author of the <cite>Pugio Fidei</cite>, whom a learned French academician,
M. Houtteville, has, by a singular blunder, numbered among
the literary stars of the sixteenth century, unable, as it would seem,
to credit the fact that so erudite a scholar could have flourished
before the age of Francis the First. He was, however, a contemporary
of St. Raymund, and is declared to have been as familiar
with the Arabic, Hebrew, and Chaldaic tongues, as he was with
Latin. The two last parts of his book are written in Hebrew, and
he employed his last years in teaching the same language to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
number of disciples, as well secular as religious.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The value of St
Raymund’s labours in founding these schools, which won him the
title of the Restorer of Oriental Studies, was publicly acknowledged
in a Bull of Clement VIII., who declares that the revival of the
Eastern languages in the Dominican schools has contributed to the
glory both of Spain and of the entire Church, and has been the
proximate cause of a vast number of conversions.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Ten thousand
Saracens had already been won to the faith before the year 1236.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no charge is more commonly brought against the
scholars of the Middle Ages, than that of neglecting the study of the
Greek and Oriental languages. Hallam, in his “Literary History,”
with a great show of candour and painstaking research, notices
certain examples of authors belonging to the twelfth, thirteenth, and
fourteenth centuries, who, he says, appear to have known a few words
of Greek. Greek books, he admits, were to be found in the libraries
of the eleventh century, and Greek lexicons were compiled by Benedictine
abbots, which seems an odd waste of labour if no one ever
dreamed of using them. In the “Philobiblon” of Richard of Bury,
written in the fourteenth century, he gravely informs us that he has
counted five words of Greek. As to the statement made in the same
book to the effect that the learned author had caused Greek and
Hebrew grammars to be drawn up for the use of students, he dismisses
the passage with the comment that no other record of such
grammars is to be found. Nor does the decree of the Council of
Vienne, passed in 1311, ordering the establishment of Greek, Hebrew,
Arabic, and Chaldaic professorships in the universities of Paris,
Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca, strike him as offering any evidence
that these languages were really cultivated. The decree, he says
(though he brings no authority in support of his words), “<em>remained a
dead letter</em>.” He accounts for the occasional phenomenon which is
to be met with, of a scholar acquainted with five words of Greek, by
attributing it to the assistance of Greek priests who found their way
into Europe; and observes, that after all, supposing anybody did
really know the language, he only used it to read “some petty treatise
of the Fathers, or apocryphal legend.” One is tempted to criticise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
the accuracy of a writer who begins by denying that any mediæval
scholars in the West were acquainted with Greek, and then goes on
to tell us what they did, and what they did not, read in that language.
But there is a more serious fault in these statements than their bad
logic. Having made an assertion of this nature on a subject which
is certainly of no mean importance in the history of literature, he
was bound to take some pains in investigating it. And it is difficult
to understand how he can really have examined the literary history
of the thirteenth century, without coming across some incidental
proof of the ardour with which the Greek and Oriental languages
were being at that time pursued in the Dominican schools. It was
a fact of such world-wide notoriety that the motive which induced
the university of Oxford to assign the Jews’ quarter of the town to
the Friars Preachers, was their known familiarity with the learned
tongues, by means of which it was hoped they might become efficient
instruments for the conversion of their Jewish neighbours. General
after General added to the ordinances made by his predecessors for
keeping up these studies. Humbert de Romanis, the fifth General
of the Order, to whom St. Raymund had communicated the success
of his own efforts in Spain, at once determined to extend the ordinance,
which had hitherto been partial in its operation, to all the
convents of the order; and in 1256 he addressed a circular letter to
the brethren, in which he invites all who feel themselves inspired by
the grace of God to devote themselves to the study of Greek, Hebrew,
and Arabic, to communicate with him, because the knowledge of
these languages is most necessary in order to extend the light of the
Gospel among the Greek schismatics and Moorish infidels.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> F.
Penna, auditor of the Rota to Clement VIII., assures us that it was
the success of the colleges established by the Friars Preachers, and
specially in Spain, that moved the Council of Vienne to issue the
decree already quoted, and the same is repeated by other writers.
The acts of that council are, however, by others attributed to the
influence of the celebrated Franciscan Raymund Lully, the Illuminated
Doctor, as he was called, who devoted many years and much labour
to the endeavour to obtain the foundation of colleges for the study
of these languages, in order to provide missionaries qualified to labour
among the infidels. He himself was a profound Orientalist, and
the legendary tales which multiplied in connection with his extraordinary
life, represent the tree under which he constructed his mountain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
hut, as bearing on its very leaves the Greek, Arabic, and Chaldaic
characters. At last he persuaded King James of Arragon to found a
college in the island of Miraman for thirteen Franciscans who were
to be given up to the study of the learned tongues. Pope Honorius
IV. entered warmly into his views, but died before he was able to
forward them; Philip le Bel acceded so far as to endow a college at
Paris, and the Council of Vienne passed its decree confirming the
erection of that college, and directing that similar establishments
should be formed in the other chief European universities. Hallam,
as we have seen, boldly asserts that the decree remained “a dead letter.”
How generally it was carried out, or how long its provisions remained
in force, may not be easy to determine; but there are precise documents
to prove that it was at least put in force at Paris and Oxford.
A letter is preserved, written in 1325, by Pope John XXII., to his
legate in Paris, recommending him to watch the holders of the new
professorships very closely, lest, under colour of the study of the
Oriental tongues, they introduce any of the pernicious philosophical
doctrines already condemned, and gathered out of the Gentile books.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
The historic evidence of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</i> existence of the professorships
at Oxford is yet more circumstantial, and is thus referred to by
Ayliffe in his history of that university. “I pass on,” he says, “to
speak of the lectures founded by Pope Clement V. for the teaching
of the Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabic, and Greek languages, among which
lectures John de Bristol, a converted Jew, read the Hebrew for
many years at Oxford with great applause; and this year (1318),
received a stipend settled on him by Walter Reynolds, Archbishop of
Canterbury, and a tax of an halfpenny per mark from every ecclesiastical
benefice throughout his province. This money was collected
at the beginning of every Lent, and was lodged with the prior of the
Holy Trinity.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He goes on to notice some frauds committed in the
collection of this tax in 1327, which, he says, is the last notice he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
finds concerning it. It is very probable that the professorships
afterwards fell into abeyance, but the assertion that they were never
founded is manifestly one of those made by a writer who draws his
bow at a venture, and never cares to inquire into the fact.</p>

<p>Among those who took part in the deliberations of the Council of
Vienne was Aymeric of Placentia, twelfth General of the Order of
Preachers, who in the previous year had established a house of studies
in every Province for the Greek and Oriental languages, requiring
the Provincials to provide very learned teachers of the same, and if
none such were to be found among the brethren, they were to
engage the services of secular professors, to be paid out of the
revenues of the Province,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> a provision which certainly seems to
imply that such professors were there to be found. This Aymeric,
whom the chronicle of the Masters-General call “a learned man, and
a great lover of letters,” did much also to promote the study of the
Scriptures at other chapters of his Order. Echard tells us of the
magnificent present bestowed by him on the convent of Bologna, in
the shape of a Hebrew Pentateuch, which Bernard of Montfauçon
describes as having himself seen. It contained an inscription,
declaring the book to be the identical copy written by Esdras the
scribe after the return from Babylon, and which he read in the ears
of the people. After being preserved in various Jewish synagogues
with the utmost veneration, Aymeric had obtained possession of it,
and its authenticity was attested by several learned Jews. Though
Echard hesitates to yield full credit to the tradition, he admits that
the antiquity of the copy was not to be doubted.</p>

<p>The culture of Greek in the Order is no less distinctly proved than
that of the Oriental tongues. William de Moerbeka made a number
of translations from Plato, Galen, and Proclus of Tyre; and his
translation of Aristotle was made directly from the original, at the
request of St. Thomas, who himself understood the language well
enough to criticise his friend’s version. Moerbeka was appointed
Archbishop of Corinth in 1277, after being several times despatched
as apostolic missionary to the East. Another fellow-student and
intimate friend of St. Thomas, the cardinal Annibal Annibaldi,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
declared to have been learned both in Greek and Arabic philosophy.
These examples of the linguistic erudition of the friars are but few
out of many that might be given, and it is clear that their Greek reading
was not limited to Apocryphal legends and petty treatises of the
Fathers. It certainly included the Greek philosophy, both Plato and
Aristotle having found translators among the Friars Preachers of the
thirteenth century. But it is more than probable that the poets
and historians of Greece were little known or cultivated, for the object
of these studies was less literary than practical. The Friars had to
contend with a false philosophy, drawn out of the books of the
Gentiles, and to maintain controversies with Greek schismatics and
Jewish and Moorish unbelievers; and they studied to arm themselves
for the work in which they were engaged. Practical views predominated
very generally in that wonderful thirteenth century, which we
are so disposed to contemplate through a poetic medium; and so we
may safely admit the likelihood that the Greek poetry was not much
studied before the period of classic renaissance.</p>

<p>The influence of the Dominicans meanwhile extended to other
universities besides those of Paris, Cologne, and Bologna, to which
they were first affiliated. At Toulouse, the nursery of their Order,
they naturally held a forward position, and led the struggle against
the Albigensian errors, for the suppression of which the university
had been mainly founded. At Orleans their convent was used as
the place of assembly for the doctors, and the establishment of the
university being for some reason regarded with disfavour by the
citizens, they directed their spleen against the friars, regarding them
as the main prop of the unpopular institution, and did their best
to level the convent with the ground. But they always held their
ground at Orleans, and their larger theories on the subject of education
may have had something to do with the character which distinguished
that university, for Orleans opposed itself to the rage for
logic, and always upheld the study of the arts.</p>

<p>One other foundation must be named, which, though it in no way
shares the brilliant historic fame of so many sister academies, is too
illustrative of the position held by the Dominicans in the mediæval
schools to be passed over in this place.</p>

<p>The ancient university of Dublin was founded in 1320 by Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
Bicknor, in virtue of a Bull from Pope Clement V., confirmed
by Pope John XXII.; one of its first masters and doctors being an
Irish Dominican, William De Hardite.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> This university was established
in connection with St. Patrick’s Cathedral, but from the
troubles of the times and the want of funds, it very soon declined,
and in the following century became all but extinct. To supply the
means of academic education to the youth of Ireland, therefore, the
Dominicans of Dublin made a noble effort. In 1428 they opened
a gymnasium, or high school, on Usher’s Island, dedicated to St.
Thomas Aquinas, in which all branches of knowledge were taught,
from grammar to theology, and to which all classes of students,
whether ecclesiastical or secular, were admitted. Hither a great
number of young men flocked to pursue their course of philosophy
and theology. As the convent was on one side of the river, and the
house of studies on the other, the friars, with that munificence which
characterised the ancient regular orders, erected a stone bridge of
four arches at their own expense, long known as the “Old Bridge,”
which was not destroyed till 1802, and which for two centuries was
the only bridge of the kind in Dublin. With the consent of the
common council, a Dominican lay brother received the tolls paid by
carriage passengers over the bridge, and sprinkled the passers-by
from a font for holy water, which was erected there. “It is an
interesting fact in the history of education in Ireland,” says Mr. Wyse,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
“that the only stone bridge in the capital of the kingdom was built
by one of the monastic orders as a communication between a convent
and its college, a thoroughfare thrown across a dangerous river
for teachers and scholars to frequent halls of learning, where the
whole range of the sciences of the day <em>was taught gratuitously</em>.”
But even this noble foundation did not satisfy the Irish Dominicans.
In 1475, the four mendicant Orders, headed by the Friars Preachers,
presented a memorial to Pope Sixtus IV., praying for canonical
authority to erect their schools in Dublin into a university for the
liberal arts and theology, which petition was granted, and a Brief<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
was issued the same year to that effect, granting the new academy
the same rights and privileges that were enjoyed by the members of
the university of Oxford. It appears certain that the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
scheme was really carried into effect, for Campion, in his History of
Ireland, written in 1570, before his conversion to the Catholic faith,
declares that before the subversion of the monasteries, “divines were
cherished” in them, “and open exercise maintained.” But whatever
were the success or the failure of the scheme, it is equally worthy of
our admiration that four mendicant Orders should thus unite, under
the leadership of the children of St. Dominic, to supply an academic
education to the youth of their country solely out of their own resources.
They asked neither for royal charters nor state endowments,
but, content with the authority of the Papal Brief, they offered to
their countrymen, with more than princely munificence, a gratuitous
university education.</p>

<p>The result of the Christian philosophy established in the schools
by the labours of St. Thomas, and propagated by the brethren of his
Order, spread far beyond the academic circles. That philosophy
appeared in an age which was full of the force and passion of youth,
and ready to find utterance in the language of the heart and the
imagination. It spoke, not in the Summa alone, but in the poetry
of Dante, in the paintings of Cimabue and Giotto, and in the minsters
of Salisbury or Cologne. For in each and all of these we see in
various ways the reflection of Christian dogma. If we may credit
the voice of tradition, it was to the geometrical science, united to the
profound Christian mysticism of Albert the Great, that the German
architects were indebted for many of the secrets of their art. He is
known to have consecrated, and is believed to have designed, more
than one of those superb cathedrals which date their existence from
the same century which witnessed the rise of the universities; and
the choir of the Dominican convent at Cologne, which Rodolph tells
us was rebuilt by the great master “according to the rules of geometry,
and as a most skilful architect,” is said to have served as the model
on which the cathedral itself was designed. Almost at the same time
the two Dominican artists, Fra Sisto, and Fra Ristoro, were initiating
an architectural reform in Italy, and it was the Greek paintings that
decorated their beautiful church of Sta. Maria Novella, at Florence,
that gave the first impulse to the genius of Cimabue. That great man,
the father of Italian art, was a pupil of the Florentine Dominicans.
The friars, “in order to carry out that portion of their rule which
commands them to be useful,” says Marchese, “had opened a
grammar school for the instruction of the Florentine youth, as well
as for their own novices. The grammar master was sometimes one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
of the friars, and sometimes a secular; and in the latter case he
received a fixed salary of a florin a month, with board and lodging.”
At this time the office happened to be filled by an uncle of Cimabue,
who numbered his own nephew among his scholars. The boy often
escaped from his books in order to watch the painters at work in the
church; and in school, instead of attending to his lessons, would
sometimes employ himself in making rude pen-and-ink sketches.
His masters discerned his rare gifts, and instead of punishing him for
preferring his pencil to his grammar, they wisely determined to
encourage his genius, and placed him under the tuition of the Greek
artists, whom he soon surpassed, as he was himself surpassed by his
own pupil Giotto. The latter also was largely indebted to the Dominican
Order, for his first patron was Pope Benedict XI., a Friar Preacher,
and a disciple of St. Thomas, who was gifted with that love of art
which has ever been hereditary in the order. Giotto was the friend
of Dante, and, like him, steeped in the essentially Christian ideas of the
age. The hero of his pencil was St. Francis, and he has left his poems
in honour of that hero painted on the walls of the church of Assisi.</p>

<p>We may judge how very powerfully the Christian philosophy of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries told on the restoration of art by a
glance at such documents as the statutes drawn up for the corporation
of Siennese painters, in 1335. “We are called by the grace of God,”
they say, “to manifest to rude and ignorant men who cannot read the
miraculous things operated by the power of the holy faith. Now our
faith chiefly consists in believing and adoring one eternal God&mdash;a
God of infinite power, immense wisdom, and boundless love and
goodness; and we are persuaded that nothing, however small it may
be, can be begun or finished without three things&mdash;namely, power,
wisdom, and will, with love.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Who drew up these statutes, and
whence were such ideas of art derived? We know not; yet the
theological cast of the phraseology leads us to infer that their author
must have been perfectly familiar with the writings of St. Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span></p>

<p>To speak broadly, then, we may say that the victory achieved in
the thirteenth century, through the labours of the scholastic theologians,
was that which established the supremacy of dogma in the
schools, and which made its power indirectly felt in every province
of thought, art, and literature. The immediate result may be stated
in the words wherein Rohrbacher sums up the ecclesiastical history
of this period. “During the whole of this time,” he says, “in spite
of the prodigious activity which we have seen taking possession of
men’s minds in the West, moving them to embrace and examine
every question of theology, philosophy, and other sciences, as well
in general as in detail, <em>not a single new heresy arose</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Order had
been introduced into the wild chaos of opinion, and the Christian
schoolmen assumed the position as masters of thought, which had
hitherto been held by pagans.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, we will anticipate an objection which
has probably suggested itself to some who have accompanied us
through the foregoing studies. Whilst freely acknowledging the
services rendered to the faith by the scholastic theologians, they
may be disposed to fear lest something of the elder tone of spirituality
was lost when the lecture halls of university professors were substituted
for the claustral schools of the Benedictines. There was
doubtless more accurate science; but was there the old contemplative
wisdom that fed itself in silent communing on God? Had the
heart kept pace with the intellect, or had not the schools become
more rich in dogma, and less full of love? And this kind of doubt
as to the possibility of uniting things apparently so little in harmony
as philosophic acuteness and unction of heart, is the more natural
and excusable as we find that it actually prevailed to a very considerable
extent among the religious students of the period, and gave
rise to not a few disputes. Hence, in the early days of the order of
Preachers, conscientious scruples were entertained by some among
the friars themselves as to the lawfulness of cultivating philosophy
and the liberal arts; and we find a decree passed, in consequence,
at one of the first Chapters-General, declaring the use and necessity of
such studies. So powerful, however, was the impulse felt in the order
towards the contemplative life during the first century of its existence,
that some still felt uneasiness lest the too great application to scholastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
science should leave the heart dry and barren. But Humbert de
Romanis severely condemned such scruples, comparing those who
entertained them to the Philistines, who deprived the children of
Israel of all smiths’ tools;<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and declared the study of philosophy to
be necessary on the part of Christian scholars, inasmuch as it was
now employed by unbelievers as a weapon with which to attack the
dogmas of the Church.</p>

<p>Dryness and spiritual barrenness, in fact, were the last faults which
could be charged against the dogmatic theologians of the thirteenth
century. It is remarkable that the Dominican convent most noted
as a house of studies north of the Alps, and which was the nursery of
all the greatest doctors of the order, was precisely that in which the
brethren most eagerly devoted themselves to the contemplative life.
All the first friars of Cologne, including Brother Henry, the first
prior, distinguished themselves as contemplative writers.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Albert
the Great&mdash;the greatest star of the Cologne school&mdash;displayed in his
later writings the germs of that tender mysticism which afterwards
appeared in the writings of Tauler and Suso. In the distinction he
draws between Christian and pagan philosophy, he clearly shows
that the studies then pursued in the order, whilst they illuminated
the intellect, were far from drying up the heart. “The contemplation
of the Catholic Christian is one thing,” he said, “and that of a
pagan philosopher is another. The philosopher meditates for his
own utility alone&mdash;his end is merely to learn and to know. But the
Christian contemplates out of love for Him whom he contemplates&mdash;that
is, God. Hence, not only has he a more perfect knowledge
for his end, <em>but he passes from knowledge into love</em>.” And the very
last of his works, written in his old age, and, as his biographer says,
with the view of refreshing his mind when weary with the fatigues
of teaching, bears the title <cite>De Adhærendo Deo</cite>, and opens with these
touching words:&mdash;“Having desired to write something, in order, as
far as possible, to end well our labours in this region of exile, we have
proposed to ourselves to inquire how a man may best detach himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
from all below, in order to attach himself solely, freely, and purely,
to our Lord God. For the end of Christian perfection is love, and
it is by love that we adhere to God.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>To the same effect are the words of St. Thomas: “In the perfect
contemplative life, divine truth is not merely <em>seen</em>, but <em>loved</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The
soul, plunging itself in the contemplation of the Divine greatness,
acquires a knowledge of God, not so much by means of light and
cognition, as by an experimental union with Him; so that, through
the affections thence derived, it knows and it contemplates. “Hence
it comes to pass,” he continues, “that He is loved more than He
is known, because He can be perfectly loved, even although He be
not perfectly known.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>His life corresponded to his teaching. Though not exhibiting to
the ordinary observer that miraculous and extraordinary character
which attaches to many of the saints, all his biographers agree in
asserting that his union with God became at last wholly uninterrupted.
“So entirely was his mind intent upon God,” says Flaminius, “that
nothing was able to separate him from this contemplation.” “I
have learnt more by prayer than by study,” were his own words to
his familiar companion, Brother Reginald, and he often repeated the
warning that, Wisdom being the gift of God, a man ought not to
endeavour or hope to acquire it by dint of study, without humbly
asking for it in prayer. From none of the writings of the saints
could there be collected maxims of more tender piety than from St.
Thomas; it was he who said that the measure of our love of God
was to love Him without measure,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> who called the Holy Scriptures
<em>the Heart of Christ</em>,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and who confessed to one of his friends that
there were two things he did not understand: how a religious could
ever think or speak of anything, but God, and how a man who had
committed mortal sin could ever smile. Divine science took in him
its most attractive form, and, to use his own words in describing the
truly wise man, it lifted him into a world beyond the moon where he
enjoyed a perpetual serenity.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The violence and injustice to which
he was exposed in the long and vexatious controversy with the
Parisian doctors never had power to disturb him; and this sweet
serenity of heart was so apparent on his countenance that he is said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
to have had a peculiar power of imparting the gift of spiritual joy to
all who conversed with him.</p>

<p>When he preached the Lent to the people of Naples, he appeared
in the pulpit like one rapt in ecstacy, with his eyes closed and his
face turned towards heaven, as though he were contemplating another
world. Even at table he was always ruminating divine things, and
St. Antoninus tells us that, when he was asleep, he was often heard
to pray aloud. It is clear that he fully recognised the possibility of
a life of study drying up the fountains of devotion, for he gave as his
reason for daily reading the Collations of Cassian, after the example
of his holy patriarch St. Dominic, that he might draw thence devotion,
and that by means of devotion his understanding might be raised to
sublimer things.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> And it was the same principle which made him,
like Bede, inflexible with himself in never absenting himself from
assisting in choir, both by day and night, frequently telling his
religious that a student must by all means keep open the wells of
devotion, so that the work of the head may never cause the heart to
grow dry and tepid.</p>

<p>Some particular instances are recorded of his special love for the
Divine Office, and the singular relish he took in the Sacred Psalmody.
Flaminius speaks of the frequent raptures and devout tears which
certain portions of it elicited from him, such as the versicle “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne
projicias me in tempore senectutis</i>,” which recurs so frequently in the
time of Lent. It may also be observed that all his biographers
notice the unction which attached to his preaching, for he possessed
an extraordinary power of moving the hearts of his hearers, and
exciting compunction and amendment of life. He was frequently
called upon to preach the Lent both at Rome and Naples, and on
one of these occasions, when preaching in St. Peter’s to an immense
audience on Good Friday, all the people who heard him were moved
to tears, and ceased not to weep until Easter day, when his Paschal
sermon filled them with holy jubilation.</p>

<p>Massoulié, one of the greatest commentators on St. Thomas, has
remarked the erroneous impression entertained by many who believe
that great doctor to have been “so completely occupied with the
speculations of the intellect as not to have applied himself equally to
excite the emotions of the heart.... It is, however, certain,” he
continues, “that, if we attentively read his works, we shall find his
love to have been equal to his knowledge, for they contain all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
secrets of the mystical life, and the sublimest and most divine operations
of grace in the hearts of those consecrated to God. In fact,
there is nothing really important in all the states to which a soul can
be raised in the spiritual life, and in all God’s secret communications
with holy souls, which he has not explained in the second part of his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summa</i>; whilst in his smaller works he has given his heart full
liberty to expand itself.... Hence,” he adds, “we must not
suppose that St. Thomas received the name of the Angelic Doctor
only on account of his profound arguments and vast knowledge of
the truths of faith; but still more justly on account of those ecstacies
which made him enter into the society of the blessed Spirits.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> So
far, indeed, was the Angel of the Schools from being all intellect and
no heart, that even the more human side of his character exhibits him
to us as peculiarly accessible to the tenderness of Christian friendship.
He described it with his pen, he felt it in his heart, and he
failed not to excite corresponding sentiments in others. The tie
which existed between him and St. Bonaventure is well known, nor
was that which bound him to Blessed Albert less close and enduring.
After the death of St. Thomas, Albert was never able to speak of
his great pupil without shedding tears, a circumstance which is even
alluded to in the process of canonisation. His brethren wondered
at it, and feared lest this excessive weeping should arise from some
weakness of the head. But his tears flowed only out of the abundance
of his love. The very name of his beloved disciple sufficed
to draw from him these tokens of affection, and he never wearied in
repeating to those around him that they had lost “the flower and
ornament of the world.”</p>

<p>The stem that produced that flower did not lose its fertility when
its fairest blossom was transplanted to Paradise. The “Order of
Truth,” as it was called, continued to bud forth a long succession of
philosophers and theologians, the bare enumeration of whose names
would fill a volume, for according to a moderate computation they
number about 5000. When St. Dominic and his six disciples first
entered the school of Alexander of Toulouse, who could have anticipated
the mighty stream that was to flow from that seemingly humble
source? Yet now “the brook had become a river,” and the river had
swelled into a sea, and the doctrine of his sons “shone forth as the morning
light,” and was poured out to “all those who sought the Truth.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> paramount importance attaching to the schools of Paris has too
long detained us from following the history of scholarship in our
own island; and we shall now have to retrace our steps some two
hundred years, in order, before speaking of the Oxford schools and
scholars of the thirteenth century, to say something of the origin of
the university, and to notice the other English schools existing at the
same period. It would be little less than audacious to pretend to
give any authentic account of the rise of Oxford University, and we
may as well at once admit the fact that one of our great national
institutions, alive and vigorous in the nineteenth century, dates its
beginning from ages whose traditions are purely mythical. However
far we go back in the history of Oxford, we are always referred
to some date that is yet earlier. From the reign of the Confessor,
we glance back to the days of the great Alfred, who allotted one-eighth
of his revenue to the support of her schools, and is popularly
regarded as her founder. But even Alfred cannot claim to have
done more than restore the schools which had existed there before
his time, and the history of St. Frideswide carries us back to the
eighth century, and tells us how in the reign of her father, Didan,
King of Mercia, certain inns were constructed in the vicinity of St.
Mary’s Church, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diversoria religioni aptissima</i>, which were used as
places of education, and grew into a religious house, afterwards
dedicated to St. Frideswide. This famous priory was the real nucleus
of the university. In 1049 Harold, then Earl of Oxford, placed
canons here; then came the Norman Conquest, and in the reign of
Henry the Scholar, who had received his early education from the
monks of Abingdon, the king handed the priory over to his favourite
chaplain Guimond, who established therein a community of Norman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
canons, and set about building, as none but a Norman prior knew
how to build.</p>

<p>From St. Frideswide’s priory let us now turn to the old residence
of the Mercian kings, in which Offa resided, which Alfred made a
“king’s house,” which had Saxon towers, deemed to be ancient in the
days of the Confessor, and which, eight years after the Conquest,
was granted to Robert D’Oyley, who added the great keep and other
buildings. Within the castle of Oxford thus founded, he and his
sworn brother in arms, Robert D’Ivery, raised a church dedicated
to St. George, and served by secular canons. This was the second
foundation stone of the university; and in 1149 his nephew, Robert
D’Oyley the Second, transferred the foundation to his priory of
Austin Canons at Osney. I cannot withhold from the curious reader
the legend of the foundation of Osney, as it is quaintly related by
Leland. After telling us that Robert D’Oyley had married a wife
named Edith, and founded a priory of black canons “at Oseney by
Oxford, among the isles that Isis river ther makyth,” he continues:
“Sum write that this was the occasion of the making of it. Edithe
usid to walke out of the Castelle with her gentlewomen to solace,
and oftentimes wher yn a certen place in a tre, as often as she cam,
a certen Pyes usid to gither to it, and ther to chattre, and as it were,
to speke on to her. Edithe much mervelyng at this matter, and
was sometyme sore ferid as by a wondre, whereupon she sent for
one Radulphe, a Chanon of S. Frediswide’s, a man of a vertuous
lyfe, and her confessour, askyng hym counsell: to whom he answerid
aftir he had sene the faschion of the Pyes chatteryng only at <em>her</em>
cummyng, that she shulde bilde sum chirche or monasterie in that
place. Then she entreated her husband to bilde a priorie, which he
did, makyng Radulphe first prior of it. The cummynge of Edithe
to Oseney, and Radulphe waiting on her, and the tre with the
chatteryng Pyes be payntid in the waulle of the arch over Edith’s
tumbe in Oseney Priorie.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The two priories of Osney and St. Frideswide became both of
them great houses of study, but the little church of St. George had
also its share in the same work. The apartments in the castle
formerly occupied by the canons were, after their removal to Osney,
made over to certain poor scholars, known as “the wardens and
scholars of St. George, within the castle of Oxford.” They formed
perhaps the earliest collegiate establishment of the university, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
governed by a body of statutes, wherein mention is made of a warden,
fellows, scholars, and commoners. The warden was always one of
the Osney canons, who came once or twice in the week to see that
good order was preserved, and in his absence governed through his
deputy. Tanner gives some curious particulars of the customs in
use among the fellows, and the ceremonies of their installation, and
tells us that Henry V. had intended to have enlarged this college
into a splendid royal foundation, but was prevented by death from
carrying out his design.</p>

<p>Other inns and halls of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</i> collegiate character gradually
clustered round these religious houses. No fewer than forty-two
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hospitia</i>, or inns for scholars, were inhabited in Robert D’Oyley’s
time. So early as 1175, the Benedictines of Winchcombe Abbey
had established a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">studium generale</i> at Oxford, for the use of their
monks, and a great number of schools, some attached to religious
and collegiate houses, and others presided over by independent
masters, very early gave their name to “School Street.” In these
buildings there was no attempt at architectural grandeur. They
were only distinguished from those devoted to “base mechanic uses”
by quaint devices and inscriptions over their doors. Both halls and
schools before 1170 were built of timber and thatched with straw,
when a great fire destroyed the greater part of the city, and the
inhabitants were induced to erect a few stone and slated edifices,
the “stramina,” or thatched houses, still appearing in many localities.
The schools of Osney Abbey were only rooms over certain shops,
and the lectures were read by the masters in their own chambers.
The effect of the “Aularian” system, as it has been called, was
certainly to multiply the <em>number</em> of the scholars; for many were
able to pursue their studies in the wretched accommodation thus
afforded them, who could find no place in the richer colleges of later
times. To the thousands of native scholars were added those who,
after the fashion of the times, resorted to Oxford from other countries,
no man being then content with studying at a single academy, or
thinking he had qualified himself for the post of doctor till he had
passed some years in foreign schools. It was no easy matter to
preserve discipline in such a motley society; the chancellor was the
only recognised authority, and when his single arm proved insufficient
for the task of government, he was assisted by an officer named
the Hebdomadarius, now represented by the Hebdomadal Board.
The disorders which prevailed here, as at Paris, finally led to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
establishment of colleges with regular statutes of discipline; but
this change, which had the immediate effect of diminishing the
number of students, was not even begun before the reign of Henry
III.</p>

<p>Previous to that date, it would not be easy to determine with any
exactness the system of discipline or of studies that prevailed. We
know, however, that in 1133, when Robert Pulleyne came over from
Paris and opened his school in Oxford, he found sacred letters had
for some years fallen into neglect, and, to restore them, not only read
lectures on the Scriptures gratuitously, but obtained the services of
other professors at his own expense. He also preached every Sunday
to the people, and left no stone unturned to instruct the students in
the learned languages. In 1142 he was summoned to Rome by
Innocent II., and, becoming Cardinal and Chancellor of the Roman
Church, obtained large privileges for the Oxford scholars. In 1149,
the very date of the Osney foundation, when England was in the thick
of the disturbances of Stephen’s reign, Vacarius, a Bolognese professor,
began to deliver lectures on civil law at Oxford, and that with so much
success as to throw the schools of arts and theology into the shade.
Before the end of the century, the study of canon law was added, and
about the same time the lectures on medicine began to attract so
much attention that the authorities felt a reasonable alarm lest their
university should altogether cease to be a seat of liberal learning.
“Physic brings men riches,” they said, “and law leads to honour, while
logic is forced to go a-foot.” All the divines of the day, both at home
and abroad, agreed in condemning the preference given to law over
theology. “What is this?” exclaims St. Bernard, “from morning till
night we litigate and hear litigation: day after day uttereth strife, and
night after night indicateth malice.” And in the same spirit Stephen
Langton reproves his fellow-ecclesiastics for “leaving the true field
of Booz, the study of Holy Scripture, in order that they may win the
poor honour of being called decretalists.” Arts, indeed, always
continued to be regarded <em>theoretically</em> as the proper subject of Oxford
University studies, but in their eagerness to acquire the more
lucrative branches of learning, the students were too often content
with a smattering of polite letters. Hence, according to Wood, they
came to be divided into three classes, the Shallow, the Patchy, and
the Solid. The first did not study arts at all, the second crammed
from convenient abstracts, and the third, a very small minority, laid
a good foundation, and thereon built a tolerable superstructure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span></p>

<p>The troubles which affected the English Church in the reign of
Henry II. affected the university very unfavourably. The persecution
directed against St. Thomas and his adherents, created such a general
feeling of insecurity that, in 1169, a great number of the Oxford
students emigrated in a body to Paris, where they were well received
by Louis VII. Indeed, at this time there was no European country
in which some English scholars might not be found, who preferred a
voluntary exile to the dangers to which they thought themselves
exposed at home from the hands of the royal tyrant. This crisis
hastened the decay of liberal studies at Oxford. Daniel Merlac, who,
about the close of Henry’s reign, travelled into Spain to collect books
and perfect himself in mathematics, declares, in the preface to his
treatise <cite>De Rerum Naturis</cite>, that it was his knowledge of the neglect
of good learning which prevailed in his own country which induced
him to remain so long in exile. He passes a very severe criticism on
the ignorance of the professors, not only at Oxford, but at Paris also,
agreeing pretty much with the strictures passed by John of Salisbury
on the “Cornificians.” In particular, he describes with great disgust
the conduct of certain “beasts,” as he calls them, whom he saw occupying
seats at the latter university with an air of great importance,
having desks set out before them, with huge books adorned with
golden letters, wherein, from time to time, they solemnly jotted down
a word or two. It was all very well, so long as they kept silence, but
as soon as they opened their mouths they betrayed their ignorance.
Wood, who complains bitterly of the decay of humane learning caused
by the reign of law at Oxford, and of logic in France says that polite
letters would never have fallen into such neglect had the monastic
schools retained their ascendancy. As it was, he says, “purity of
speech decayed, philosophy was neglected, and nothing but Parisian
quirks prevailed.”</p>

<p>Oxford revived a little during the reign of the Lion-hearted Richard,
who loved the city as his birthplace, and, moreover, was inclined to
favour the university, were it only to emulate his great rival, Philip
Augustus, who had declared himself the protector of the Paris
scholars. His brother John seemed at first disposed to follow his
example, and granted the students their first charter, exempting them
from the jurisdiction of the Ordinary; but he soon counterbalanced
this favour by hanging three clerks&mdash;an act so deeply resented by the
ecclesiastical authorities that the city was laid under an interdict, and
the scholars dispersed to Cambridge, Reading, and Maidstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span></p>

<p>Better days dawned on the Church on the accession of Henry III.
The arrival of the mendicant orders in England gave an immense
stimulus to the schools, and in 1229 the king took occasion of the
quarrel just then raging between the civil and academic authorities
at Paris, to invite the discontented masters and scholars over to
England. This immigration from France raised Oxford to a high
degree of prosperity. The number of her students is said to have
risen to 30,000, though Wood admits that the company was not
always the most select. “Among these,” he says, “were a set of
varlets, who pretended to be scholars, shuffling themselves in, and
doing much villany in the university by thieving, quarrelling, &amp;c.
They lived under no discipline and had no tutors, but, only for fashion’s
sake, would sometimes thrust themselves into the schools at ordinary
lectures; and when they went to perform any mischief, then would
they be accounted scholars, that so they might free themselves from
the jurisdiction of the burghers.”</p>

<p>The presence of so many “varlets” will perhaps account for the
frequency of unseemly brawls which disturbed the peace of the city,
and brought sad discredit on the university. One instance will suffice
to show the semibarbarous state of society in the city of letters at the
beginning of the thirteenth century. Cardinal Otho, the cardinal
legate, coming to Oxford in 1238, was honourably entertained at
Osney Abbey. The scholars sent him a handsome present for his
table, and a deputation of them came after dinner to pay their respects.
The Italian porter, however, not only refused them admission, but,
through the half-open door, loaded them with abuse. This, of course,
was not to be endured; the door was forced in a moment, and a
lively contest ensued between the English and the Italians. The
cardinal’s steward, stung with the derisive epithets lavished on him
by the scholars, threw some dirty water in the face of a poor Irish
priest, who was patiently waiting at the door for some broken victuals.
This was the signal for a call to arms, and one of the party, seizing
a bow, shot the unhappy steward dead on the spot. The legate took
refuge in the church tower, whence, escaping by night, he joined the
king and demanded justice. Thirty scholars were accordingly
arrested, the city was laid under another interdict, and all the
university exercises suspended. Nor was tranquillity restored till
ample satisfaction had been offered by the English bishops, who, says
Matthew Paris, were ready to make any sacrifice necessary to preserve
“the second school of the Church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span></p>

<p>Brawls of this sort make up a very large portion of early Oxford
history. Here, as at Paris, the division of “nations” was a fruitful
source of squabbling. Northerns and Southerns, Welshmen, Englishmen,
and Irishmen, fought pitched battles, one with another, on all
available opportunities; and the Jews, whose audacity reached an
incredible height, did their best to add another element of discord by
disturbing the scholars at their prayers. We need not enter into the
history of these strange disturbances. The Irish seem to have
exhibited the greatest pugnacity, and obliged the magistrates to pass
many wholesome laws for their correction and conversion to “more
civil walking,” though, as it would seem, with very small success.
The chief occasions on which the king’s peace was wont to be broken
were the national festivals celebrated in honour of St. George, St.
Patrick, and St. David; and at length it became necessary to forbid
popular demonstrations on these days, under pain of the greater
excommunication.</p>

<p>In this early period of the university history, the schools frequented
by the scholars were of two kinds,&mdash;the secular schools ruled by
masters who rented rooms in the houses and over the shops of the
burghers, and the claustral schools, held in the various religious
houses. As a general rule, the students were expected to know
grammar before matriculating at the university, but in case they
entered very young, or that their early education had been neglected,
they could make up their deficiencies in the grammar schools, some of
which were afterwards attached to colleges, for the benefit of the
clerks and choristers connected with those institutions. Wood gives
some interesting particulars about these grammar schools. He says
they were placed by the chancellor under the supervision of some
master of arts, to whom the grammar master promised obedience.
He moreover engaged to read nothing with his scholars without
license from the chancellor, to instruct them in Latin authors, and
make them construe in French as well as English, and not to read
certain portions of the Latin poets, which might be considered
injurious to good morals. Degrees were at that time granted in
grammar, as in other faculties. Thus, in the reign of Edward I.,
we find Maurice Byrchensaw graduating as bachelor of grammar
and rhetoric, and composing, as his customary exercise on that
occasion, a hundred verses in praise of the university, and thereupon
having his head solemnly crowned with laurel.</p>

<p>Some of the illustrations which Wood has collected as to the state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
of studies at Oxford in ancient times, are sufficiently amusing. It
seems that Lent was generally a time unfavourable to peace, by
reason of the unusual amount of logical disputation, indulged in at
that season by the scholars who were preparing for their degrees.
Hence the king’s peace was very often broken over the discussion
of quiddities, and the grammar students showed themselves equally
pugnacious over the niceties of Latin syntax. Musical degrees were
very often granted, the candidates being required to read the musical
books of Boëthius, and on the day of inception to present a mass of
their own composition, which was to be sung on the occasion,
together with certain antiphons. The masses and antiphons were
generally composed in two parts, up to the time of Henry VIII.,
who, being exceedingly skilful in musical science, was able, not only
to sing his part sure, but to compose masses in four, five, and even
six parts, which more complicated style of composition thus came
into fashion at the university.</p>

<p>The Oxford scholars often complained of the grievance of having
to attend the schools on festival days, and presented more than one
poetical petition to the ruling powers that they might have a little
breathing space, at least on the greater feasts. And certainly, if we
may take the account given us at a considerably later period as
furnishing any notion of the life of a poor scholar of the thirteenth
century, it was one of hard work and little comfort. It occurs in
a sermon preached at Cambridge in the middle of the sixteenth
century, by Thomas Lever, Fellow of St John’s, and has been preserved
by the historian Strype. There is every reason to suppose
that the picture which he gives would apply as well to the reign of
the First as to that of the Sixth Edward; substituting the hearing of
Mass for the attendance of common prayer. “There be divers which
rise daily about four or five of the clock in the morning, and from
five to six use common prayer in a common chapel; and from six
till ten of the clock use ever either private study or common lectures.
At ten of the clock they go to dinner, whereat they be content with
a penny piece of beef among four, having a few pottage made of the
broth of the said beef, with salt and oatmeal, and nothing else.
After this slender diet they be either teaching or learning until five
of the clock in the evening; whereat they have a supper not much
better than their dinner. Immediately after which they go either to
reasoning in problems or to some other study until it be nine or ten
o’clock; and then, being without fires, they are fain to walk, or run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
up and down half an hour, to get a heat on their feet when they go to
bed.”</p>

<p>At the opening of the thirteenth century, then, we find England
possessed of schools and universities, the value of which was felt
both at home and abroad, and which had already produced several
men of eminence. Among these was Giraldus Cambrensis, the
Welsh historian, who received his early education in the school of
his uncle, the Bishop of St. David’s; after which he passed on to
Paris, which city he twice revisited and lectured there on polite literature.
Giraldus was one of those who deeply deplored the preference
then given to law and logic over classical studies, and laboured hard
to keep alive a better taste among his contemporaries. The second
time he went to Paris he assures us the doctors and scholars were
never weary of listening to him, being thoroughly bewitched by the
sweetness of his voice and the elegance of his language. Henry II.
summoned him to court, and appointed him his chaplain and tutor
to Prince John, with whom he travelled into Ireland, the result of
which expedition was seen in his two works, the “Topography” and
the “Conquest” of Ireland. Then he accompanied Archbishop
Baldwin in his progress through Wales and the western counties of
England, preaching the Crusade, and has given a description of this
journey also in his “Itinerary.” It was performed on foot, and its
difficulties are described with a graphic, and, sometimes, a poetic pen.
We see the weary travellers making their way through the mountain
ravines near Bangor, till the poor archbishop is forced at last to sit
down and rest on an oak tree torn up by the winds and lying by the
wayside. As he converses with his followers, the sweet notes of a
bird are heard from an adjoining thicket. Is it a thrush or a nightingale?
“The nightingale is never heard in Wales,” observes one.
“Is she not? Then she has followed wise counsel never to come
into Wales,” replies the archbishop, “whilst we, following unwise
counsel, are going right through it.” What an exquisite picture is that
which he gives of the Vale of Llanthony, where the monks, as they
sit in the cloister of their abbey, have but to raise their eyes from
their books in order to behold the pleasant prospect of mountains
ascending on all sides to a great height, and may watch the deer
peacefully grazing on the verdant slopes. In old times, he adds, a
hermitage stood on this spot, with no other ornament than green
moss and ivy. One sees in passages like these that artistic love
of beauty which is one of the marked characteristics of our early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
writers.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> In 1179 we find Giraldus at Oxford, where he recited his
“Topography” before the university, dividing it into three parts and
assigning a separate day to each. On each day there was a great feast&mdash;the
first day for the poor, the second for the doctors, the third for
the scholars and burghers. The entertainment, he says, was worthy
of classic times, and its like had never before been seen in England.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of the literary men, however, who
flourished in England at this time were monks, and the pupils of
monks. Such were the historians William of Malmsbury, Florence
of Worcester, Simeon of Durham, Roger Wendover, Matthew of
Westminster, Eadmer of Canterbury, and many more. Some of
them indeed had graduated at the universities before assuming the
monk’s cowl, like Simeon of Durham, who lectured on natural philosophy
at Oxford, “diving into the hidden recesses of nature,” during
the reign of Stephen. In England, as elsewhere, not a few of those
who in early life had won their doctor’s cap in the schools, grew
weary of the vanity which they found there, and took refuge in the
cloister. It seems idle to speak of men whose names are now known
only to the curious, yet, in their own day, who was more thought of
than Robert de Bertune, “the Oxford clerk,” as Gervase calls him,
who died Bishop of Hereford, and whose sanctity of life caused some
steps to be taken to procure his canonisation? Or Thomas of Marleberg,
who, after teaching canon law at Oxford, Paris, and Exeter,
retired to Evesham, bringing with him all the books he had used in the
schools, and became first prior and then abbot of his monastery.
His doctor’s library included one book of Democritus, the Gradual
of Constantine, St. Isidore’s Offices, several of the works of Cicero,
Lucan, and Juvenal, together with a valuable collection of MS. notes,
sermons, and questions on theology. There were, besides, other
notes and rules on the art of grammar, and a book concerning
accents. During his government he caused a great number of useful
books to be copied out and bound, and bought a fine collection of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
the books of Scripture, with their accompanying gloss. Evesham
always retained its character for learning, and there, as well as at
Reading, St. Alban’s, Ramsey, and Glastonbury, a great number of
excellent scholars were reared. There can be no doubt that the
monastic schools of England continued to cultivate humane letters
long after they had fallen into neglect at the universities. The
Latin poets who flourished in England in the twelfth century are
noticed with respect by all critics; and the epic poem of “Antiocheis,”
composed by Joseph of Exeter, after his return from the Holy Land,
whither he accompanied King Richard I., is declared by Warton to
be “a miracle of classic composition.” He also praises the elegant
versification of Henry of Huntingdon, Robert of Dunstable,
Lawrence of Durham, and others, all of whom were monks. None
of these English Latinists condescended to the barbarism of Leonine
rhymes, which they probably regarded with much the same feeling
that Bede expressed for the “songs of vulgar poets.” One and all
did their utmost to uphold the rules of prosody, and rejoiced in the
solemn protest put forth by their countryman, Geoffrey de Vinsauf,
against the corruption of pure Latinity.</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon, named above among our Latin poets, and
equally distinguished as an historian, was altogether a scholar of
monastic training. He received his education in the school of
Ramsey, a monastery which enjoyed the reputation of having none
but learned men for its abbots. The library collected by them was
the richest in the kingdom. The catalogue may still be seen among
the Cottonian MSS., and contains, besides books of more ordinary
occurrence, the works of Aristotle, Plato, Sallust, Terrence, Martial,
Ovid, Lucan, Horace, Virgil, and Prudentius. There was also a
Hebrew Bible, and Hebraic literature was cultivated by many of the
monks. When the Jews were banished from England, a great
number of their books were sold, and the monks largely possessed
themselves of these treasures. A great sale of Rabbinical MSS.
took place at Huntingdon and Stamford, when Geoffrey, prior of
Ramsey, made large purchases, and used the books he thus procured
to such good purpose as to become a great adept in the Hebrew
language, and communicate similar tastes to many of his brethren.
Even down to the middle of the thirteenth century, notices occur of
Hebrew scholars among the monks and librarians of Ramsey, and
one of them, Lawrence Holbech by name, is spoken of as compiling
a Hebrew Lexicon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span></p>

<p>Great work at this time went on in the English scriptoria, and a
pleasant sort of barter was practised among the different abbeys, by
means of which each was supplied with the goods most to their
liking. Thus brother Henry, of Hyde Abbey, wrote out with his
own hand the works of Boëthius, Suetonius, Terence, and Claudian,
which he exchanged with a prior of St Swithin’s, who had a more
classical taste than himself, for four missals and a copy of St.
Gregory on the pastoral care. All the monks of Hyde Abbey were
good writers and illuminators, and were taught to bind their books
with much care. In 1240 the library of Glastonbury contained four
hundred books, and among them were the chief Latin classics. At
Edmondsbury the scriptorium was endowed with two mills, and at
Ely the revenues of two churches were granted to the monks “for
the making of books.” At Peterborough Abbey the library at the
time of the dissolution contained 1700 manuscripts. And at Tavistock,
besides the ordinary school and library, there existed another
school in which the Anglo Saxon language was taught, for the purpose
of enabling the monks to decipher their own ancient charters.
But Tavistock was not the only religious house in which the old
English tongue continued to be studied. In the library of Trinity
College, Cambridge, is still preserved a Latin Psalter after two
versions, each version written in a separate column. Over the lines
of one column runs an Anglo-Saxon translation, and over those of the
other one in Anglo-Norman. The writing is exquisite, and the whole
manuscript is richly illuminated, containing several historical paintings,
together with the portrait of Eadmer, the monk of Canterbury,
who wrote it out in the reign of Stephen. He holds in his hand a
metal pen, and an inscription over his head records his caligraphic
skill. He is, moreover, found worthy to be noted in the library
catalogue as mighty in the art of transcription, and from his name is
considered to have been of Saxon lineage.</p>

<p>Some of the larger of our English abbeys had not only schools
within their own precincts, but others dependent on them in the
neighbouring towns. Thus the school of Dunstable was dependent
on the abbey of St. Alban’s, and in 1180 was governed by a pupil of
that abbey, who in every way deserves mention as one of the most
remarkable scholars of his time. Alexander Neckham was foster-brother
to Richard I., and educated in the claustral school of St.
Alban’s. Being appointed regent of the Dunstable school, he taught
there for some time with considerable success, and thence proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
to Paris, where he studied and professed for seven years. At the end
of that time he returned to England, and resumed his former
functions at Dunstable. At last, wishing to enter the monastic state,
he is said to have applied for admission to the abbot of St. Alban’s,
in an epistle commencing with the words, “Si vis, veniam,” to which
the abbot, who loved a joke, replied, “Si bonus es, venias,&mdash;si
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nequam nequaquam</i>.” The pun on his name (Neckam) appears to
have disgusted him; at any rate, instead of a Benedictine, he became
an Augustinian, and took the habit in the priory of Cirencester,
about the year 1187. He was a universal scholar, a proficient in
canon law, medicine, and theology, the best Latin poet of his age,
and remarkable for the purity of his style. Like a true scholastic,
he was a great lover of grammar, and wrote several works on the
subject, which are still preserved in MS., some at Oxford, some at
Cambridge, and some in the British Museum. He was also the
author of a set of tracts, common enough in later times, for teaching
scholars the Latin names of different articles by connecting them in
a sort of descriptive narrative. To this work he gives the title of
<cite>De nominibus Utensilibus</cite>, in which he describes every apartment of a
house, from the kitchen to the bedrooms, with the furniture, dress,
&amp;c., in use in the twelfth century. An interlinear version is given in
French, and at the end are grammatical notes and comments. He
has also left a poem on the monastic character, another on science,
in which he treats with some sublimity of the creation of the angels,
stars, and elements; of the birds, fishes, rivers, and principal towns
in England; of the earth, with her metals, plants, fruits, and animals;
and of the seven liberal arts. His remarks on natural history are
original and sagacious, specially those contained in his treatise <cite>De
Rerum Naturis</cite>. In his poems he praises his country with its
pastures, cornfields, and running streams, and celebrates the good
qualities of its sons. “The feathered birds of Lybia, and pheasants,”
he says, “often enrich thy tables, O Anglia. Nowhere are there
more joyous countenances at the festive board, more gracious
hosts, more profuse hospitality. The adornment of the table could
not be more exquisite, or the service more prompt and cheerful.
The Englishman, by nature and from his boyhood, gives gifts worthy
to be given; and no age is too old to give.” After adding much
on the liberality of his countrymen, he observes, that they are fond
of hunting, and that they have a very subtle genius for mechanics,
as well as for the liberal arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span></p>

<p>The character here bestowed on our countrymen corresponds well
enough with the more satirical portraiture of Nigel Wireker, who, in
his <cite>Speculum Stultorum</cite>, whilst lashing the follies of the world in
general, and the universities in particular, describes the English
students at Paris, as “noble in look and manner, full of strong sense
brightened with wit, lavish with their money, and haters of everything
sordid, whilst their tables groan with dishes, and the drinking
knows no laws.”</p>

<p>The students who frequented the English seminaries were seldom
of the nobler class. So late as the reign of Henry II., the Anglo-Norman
barons preferred sending their sons to French schools
and universities, out of a nervous dread lest their Norman speech
should be barbarised by any admixture of the English accent. Even
in the English schools for the higher orders, the native tongue was
never used. Children were taught the French tongue from their
cradle; and this custom, introduced at the Conquest, continued
to prevail down to the reign of Edward III. However, it was
not easy to preserve the Norman dialect pure from Saxon adulteration
in a Saxon land, and hence the sly allusions which
Chaucer throws out to the difference between the French of Paris
and that of the school of “Stratford atte Bowe.” Robert of
Gloucester, who felt the absurdity of the system, and was one of the
first writers after the Conquest who ventured to use the English
language for literary purposes, after telling us that the Norman spoke
nothing but French, and “their children did teche,” observes that,
unless a man know French, men talk of him but little, and that none
but “low men” now hold to their national speech&mdash;a thing not to
be found in any other country. “But I wot well,” he continues,
“that it is well to know both, for the more a man knoweth, the more
worth he is.”</p>

<p>Besides the great monastic and cathedral schools, there existed in
London and other large towns certain public schools, of which Fitz
Stephen has given a lively description, doubtless familiar to the
reader. “On holidays,” he says, “it is usual for these schools to
hold public assemblies in the church, in which the scholars engage
in logical disputations, some using enthymems, and others perfect
syllogisms; some aiming at nothing but to gain the victory, and
make an ostentatious display of their acuteness; while others have
in view the investigation of truth. Artful sophists on these occasions
acquire great applause, some by a prodigious inundation of words,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
and others by their specious but fallacious arguments. After the
disputation, other scholars deliver rhetorical declamations, in which
they observe all the rules of art, and neglect no topic of persuasion.
Even the younger boys in the different schools contend against each
other about the principles of grammar, and the preterites and supines
of verbs. There are some who, in epigrams, rhymes, and verses,
use that trivial raillery so much practised by the ancients, freely
attacking their companions with Fescennine license, but suppressing
the names, touching with Socratic wit the failings of their school-fellows,
or even of greater personages, or biting them more keenly
with a Theonine tooth.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It was in one of these London schools
that St. Thomas of Canterbury received his early education, after
leaving the school of the Canons Regular at Merton, and before
proceeding to the university. The masters were generally some of
those professors whom Oxford and Paris sent forth at this time in
such abundance that not only cities, but villages also, had their learned
teachers, as Roger Bacon testifies. They were, of course, skilled in
the disputatious sciences of the day, and extremely well fitted to
train a generation of “artful sophists.”</p>

<p>There was one private school of this period of which we must give
a more particular notice, associated as it is with the history of St.
Gilbert of Sempringham, the founder of the only religious order
which we can claim as strictly of English growth. He was the son
of a Norman knight of Lincolnshire and a Saxon mother, inheriting
more of the Saxon than the Norman temperament. In youth he
showed no taste for the chase or the tilt-yard, and gave no promise
of intellectual superiority to make up for his deficiency in manly
accomplishments. But as he grew in years a studious disposition
began to manifest itself, in consequence of which his father sent
him to study at Paris, where he remained until he had received his
master’s degree, and, with it, license to open a school. The school
of Sempringham very soon became famous. It received pupils of
both sexes, who were trained not merely in the rudiments of learning,
but also in a holy life; for, says the biographer of the Saint, the
scholars, though they wore a secular garb, lived under a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
monastic discipline. They were not allowed to play and wander
about like other children, but were obliged to keep silence in the
church and in the dormitory, where the boys all slept together, and
were only supposed to speak in certain appointed places. They
had, moreover, set hours for study and prayer, and, in a word, were
trained in the rules of strict discipline. “For, from his childish
years, it had been the one thought of Gilbert how he could best win
souls to God, and profit them by word and example; wherefore,
keeping himself unspotted from the world, he occupied himself incessantly
in holy and spiritual things.”</p>

<p>After a time, two churches were founded on his father’s manor,
and Gilbert was instituted rector of the parishes of Sempringham
and Torington; although, not being at that time in holy orders, he
was obliged to appoint a chaplain to serve the church in his stead.
However, he acted as rector in so far as regarded the government
of his parish and his school. He catechised and instructed his
parishioners, and that with such success that we are told the greater
number of those who heard him served God as if under regular
monastic discipline, although remaining seculars: he was earnest in
his endeavours to withdraw them from the revelries so attractive to
their class, and to accustom them to the practice of the works of
mercy; he particularly made it his aim to instruct them in the ritual
and ceremonies of the Church; and at length it came to be said
that you might tell a parishioner of Sempringham by his way of
entering church, the humility of his attitude, and the devotion he
exhibited in prayer.</p>

<p>The young rector himself resided in a little house which he built
for himself in the churchyard, and spent most of his day in the
church. After a time, however, his reputation reaching the ears of
Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln, he was summoned to the Episcopal
Palace, and, having received minor orders, was appointed to an office
in the bishop’s household, which he retained under his successor,
Alexander. By the latter he was ordained priest, and promoted to
the post of Penitentiary to the diocese. Greater dignities were
offered to him; but Gilbert longed to return to his rustic parishioners,
and, in 1130, he escaped from his court life, and with a glad heart
made his way back to Sempringham. He had conceived the idea of
attaching a religious house of some sort to his church, and among his
former pupils he selected seven young women, for whom he built a
small monastery adjoining the north wall of the church of St. Andrew.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
We are told that the nuns retained the learned tastes they had
acquired in the founder’s school, so that at last it was found
necessary to forbid them to speak Latin to one another, unless
occasion should oblige them. A very considerable portion of their
time was given to reading and meditation, and minute rules were
given as to their manner of behaving as they read in the cloister,
where they were to sit one behind another, and all looking one way,
unless two chanced to be reading out of the same book. The same
rule enjoined that they should ever preserve a sweet and cheerful
countenance, and never exhibit signs of anger. To provide for the
temporal necessities of his nuns, Gilbert appointed first a community
of lay sisters, and then of lay brothers, and he conceived the idea of
establishing a certain sort of religious rule among all the labourers
on his paternal estate, to which, by the death of his father, he had
now succeeded, and making his various farms dependent, in some
sort, on the monastery, at the same time that they supplied the
temporal necessities of the nuns.</p>

<p>Gilbert’s aim in this singular experiment was the amelioration of
the lower orders; for the expressions used in speaking of those
whom he selected show that they were of the very humblest class.
Some were those whom he had known from childhood, the hinds
and peasants attached to the manor; others were runaway serfs, for
whom he obtained freedom by giving them the religious habit; and
others, again, were very poor beggars. In fact, like the servant in
the Gospel, he went out into the highways and hedges, and wherever
he found the poor and the despised, he invited them into the house of
the Lord. He did not attempt to teach these lay brethren letters,
only requiring them to learn the Pater, Credo, and Miserere in Latin,
but he trained them in obedience, humility, and temperance. They
had constitutions of their own, admirably fitted for their state, and
for giving religious discipline to a community made up of shepherds,
herdsmen, and farm-labourers, who were to discharge the humble
duties of their several callings under the religious garb. Some of
the rules show plainly enough the kind of men for whom Gilbert
was legislating; they were Saxon rustics, whose besetting sin was a
love of the alehouse, and whom Gilbert accordingly forbids to drink
wine, unless it be well watered, and prohibits, under any pretext,
from selling anything to seculars, or from opening any house for the
sale of liquor, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seu, ut lingua Teutonica dicitur, tappam</i>. It was a
strange experiment this, of converting a gross rustic population into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
a religious community, and for a time it seemed blessed with perfect
success. The institute spread rapidly, till at last Gilbert felt the necessity
of providing for its more regular government, and for this purpose
he applied to the Cistercians, in order that it might be grafted
into their family. The request was, however, declined, and Gilbert
had no other course open than to found another order of canons,
who might take the spiritual direction of his convents of nuns. The
foundation of this third branch of the institute did not take place till
nearly twenty years after the establishment of the first convent. The
first canons, like the first nuns, were chosen from Gilbert’s own
scholars; seven were attached to every priory of the religious sisters,
besides which, some houses were founded exclusively for the canons,
and before he died Gilbert saw himself the spiritual father of fifteen
hundred nuns and seven hundred canons, besides a vast number of
lay brethren, whom he had rescued from their life of abject serfdom,
but from whose turbulent conduct he had unhappily much to suffer.
The order, in fact, declined rapidly after the death of its founder,
who lived to extreme old age, being upwards of a hundred at the time
of his death. Its weak point was the attempt made to unite so many
forms of religious life under one government, and perhaps the hope
of long preserving an austere religious discipline among an association
of rural labourers savoured somewhat of a scholar’s Utopian dream.</p>

<p>The Gilbertine canons, however, continued for many years to
cherish a love of letters, and had the chief part in the foundation of
that pseudo-university of Stamford which threatened at one time to
draw away the north country students from Oxford, the Stamford
schools taking their rise in a Gilbertine house of studies. Among
the first writers who condescended to make use of the English
vernacular tongue was a Gilbertine canon named Robert Manning,
who, about the beginning of the thirteenth century, considering in
his heart that the “lewd,” as well as the “learned,” ought to know
something of the history of their own country, and to be familiar
with the deeds of kings,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span></p>
<p>In the reign of Henry II., however, the English tongue (as distinguished
from the Anglo-Saxon) had not yet assumed a literary
shape. In all higher schools, public or private, the French and Latin
languages were exclusively used. The Saxon or Teutonic dialect,
referred to in the Gilbertine rule, was considered only fit for peasants,
and even they had a certain comprehension of Latin. This is clear
from many circumstances. Thus, Giraldus tells us that when Archbishop
Baldwin journeyed through Wales for the purpose of preaching
the Crusade, he was never so successful as when he preached in
Latin. The populace, as we know, do not always measure their
appreciation of a discourse by the degree in which they understand
it, yet it is difficult to think that these effective sermons can have
been delivered in an altogether unknown tongue. But the fact is
that, in one respect, the rude ignorant peasantry of the Middle Ages
were a great deal more learned than the pupils of our model schools.
In a certain sort of way, every child was rendered familiar with the
language of the Church. From infancy they were taught to recite
their prayers, the antiphons, and many parts of the ritual of the
Church, in Latin, and to understand the meaning of what they learnt,
and hence they became familiar with a great number of Latin words;
so that a Latin discourse would sound far less strange in their ears
than in those of a more educated audience of the same class in the
present day.</p>

<p>In many cases, indeed, the children who were taught in the
priest’s, or parochial school, learnt grammar, that is, the Latin
language; but all were required to learn the Church chant and a
considerable number of Latin prayers, and hymns, and psalms. This
point of poor school education deserves more than a passing notice.
Its result was, that the lower classes were able thoroughly to understand,
and heartily to take part in, the rites and offices of Holy Church.
The faith rooted itself in their hearts with a tenacity which was not
easily destroyed, even by penal laws, because they imbibed it from its
fountain source&mdash;the Church herself. She taught her children out
of her own ritual and by her own voice, and made them believers
after a different fashion from those much more highly educated
Catholics of the same class who, in our day, often grow up almost as
much strangers to the liturgical language of the Church as the mass
of unbelievers outside the fold. Can there be any incongruity more
grievous than to enter a Catholic school, rich in every appliance of
education, and to find that, in spite of the time, money, and method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
lavished on its support, its pupils are unable to understand and recite
the Church offices, and are untrained to take part in Church
Psalmody? The language of the Church has, therefore, in a very
literal sense, become a dead language to them, and it is from other,
and far inferior, sources that they derive their religious instruction.
Thus they are ignorant of a large branch of school education, in which
the children of a ruder and darker age were thoroughly trained; no
doubt, on the other hand, they know a great many things of which
children in the Middle Ages were altogether ignorant, and the
question is simply to determine which method of instruction has
most practical utility in it. Without dogmatising on this point, we
may be permitted to regret that through any defect in the system of
our parochial schools, Catholic congregations should in our own days
be deprived of the solemn and thorough celebration of those sacred
offices which in themselves comprise a body of unequalled religious
instruction; and that in an age which makes so much of the theory
of education, we should have to confess our inability to teach our
children to pray and sing the prayers of the Church, as the children
of Catholic peasants prayed and sang them six hundred years ago.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The English schools of that period enjoyed the benefit of no other
inspection than that of the parish priest and the archdeacon, “the
eye of the bishop,” as he was called; and if their pupils knew little
about “monocotyledons,” the “crustacea,” or grammatical analysis,
they were able to recite their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma Redemptoris</i> and their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dixit
Dominus</i> with hearty, intelligent devotion. They knew the order of
the Church service, and could sing its psalms and antiphons in the
language of the Church, and to her ancient tones; and so they did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
not, through their ignorance, oblige their pastors to lay aside, as
obsolete, the use of that office so truly called Divine, in order to
substitute in its place English hymns and devotions from any less
inspired source. On this point we hold their education, therefore, to
have been immeasurably superior to our own, nor are we to suppose
that because they learnt Latin prayers and the Church chant, they
learnt nothing besides. Reading and grammar are often named as
taught in parochial schools; and among the humblest class of pupils
a good deal of instruction, both devotional and practical, was conveyed
in English verse, which the pupils committed to memory, much
as some among ourselves have, ere now, learnt to remember the
number of days in each month by means of doggerel rhymes. The
traditions of the Saxon schools, wherein so much use was made of
these versified instructions, was kept up so late as the fifteenth
century, when we shall have occasion to quote some of the methods
in popular use for teaching children the succession of the English
kings, the names of towns and villages, the four quarters of the globe,
and the outline of the Latin accidence. The Commandments of God
and the Church, the Creed, Our Father, and Hail Mary, and other
similar portions of Christian doctrine, were also taught in verse, as
they may still be seen in most French elementary books of religious
instruction; and specimens of the English language, as it existed in
the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, might very fairly be
selected from the different versified forms of the Hail Mary in use
at these periods. I will give but one, which is supposed to belong to
the early part of the thirteenth century:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">So be the bairn that is boren of the.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is needless to observe, that in all times a very special importance
has been attached by Catholic teachers to the instruction of the
people in their prayers. In those early times, when the laws of the
State recognised that the people had souls as well as bodies and purses,
this was even made a matter of legislation, as in the canons of King
Edgar the Peaceable, and the statutes of Canute, wherein every father
was commanded to teach his children the Creed and the Our Father,
and every man was required to know them, “if he desired to be laid
in a hallowed grave, or to be thought worthy of Holy Housel.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
familiar explanation of these prayers, and of the Sunday Gospels,
formed the ordinary subjects of the parish priest’s sermon; and in
almost every collection of Synodal decrees we find injunctions calling
on Christian men and women to learn their prayers, and say them
seven times a day. The Hail Mary was enjoined, in addition, about
the beginning of the thirteenth century, as we find in the constitutions
of St. Richard of Chichester.</p>

<p>Some of the very earliest known specimens of the English, as distinguished
from the Anglo-Saxon language, are fragments of hymns
which appear to have been in popular use in our poor schools. One
of these is commonly known as St. Godric’s hymm, and runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>To understand whence St. Godric derived his poetical inspiration,
we must briefly glance at his history. He lived in the reigns of
Stephen and Henry II., and began life as a Norfolk pedlar, getting
his living by travelling about the country and selling smallwares in
the villages through which he passed. We may fancy him such a
one as Wordsworth’s Wanderer, concealing under a humble speech
and garb a sublime philosophy. Wanderers of the twelfth century,
however, had one advantage over our modern pedlars; they visited
not only fairs and cities, but holy shrines and places of pilgrimage;
nay, generally speaking, the fairs which they attended were assembled
round some holy spot, and took their origin in the devout celebration
of a martyr’s or a founder’s festival. Godric, as he plodded on
through the north country on his way from Scotland, whither he
had gone by sea on a trading expedition, visited Lindisfarne and
Durham, and the Isle of Farne, made sacred by the hermit-life of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
St. Cuthbert. These pilgrimages awoke his soul to a new life, and
abandoning his trade, he repaired to Jerusalem, and on his way
back visited the holy shrine of Compostella.</p>

<p>Returning to England, he took service in the family of a Suffolk
gentleman, but disgusted with the profligacy of his fellow-servants,
once more left his country and went to visit the holy places of
Rome. Nevertheless, the scenes where first his heart had been
touched by God drew him back to them by a sweet, irresistible
attraction; and after some years more spent in these devout wanderings,
Godric felt himself moved to return to the north of England,
and there seek out some solitude where he might lead the life of
an anchorite. He entered Durham, therefore, a way worn, ragged
pilgrim, and desiring, before he utterly retired from the world, to
acquire a knowledge of such psalms and devotions as might enable
him to sing the praises of God in his cell, he repaired for that purpose
to the school which, as was often the case, was held, in default of a
schoolhouse, within the church of St. Mary’s.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In this school, says
Reginald of Durham, children were taught the first elements of
letters, and here Godric learnt many things of which he was before
ignorant, but which he now acquired “by hearing, reading, and
chanting them.” And those things which he heard the children
frequently repeat became tenaciously fixed in his memory. In a
very brief space of time, therefore, he learnt as many psalms, hymns,
and prayers as sufficed for his purpose, and retired to a lonesome
wilderness north of Carlisle, which he afterwards exchanged for that
of Finchdale, where he died, about the year 1170. William of
Newbridge, who often visited him, describes him as one whose body
seemed already dead, but whose tongue was ever repeating the names
of the Three Divine Persons. The similarity of some of the expressions
occurring in St. Godric’s hymn, to productions of the same kind
in popular use in the following centuries, leads us to believe that it
may have been one of the school hymns he had learnt at Durham,
unless indeed we accept as literally true the legend which represents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
it as having been taught him by Our Lady herself. The whole notice
of this Durham school is exceedingly interesting, and not only confirms
what has been said as to the teaching of the Church chant and
office, but shows us that the poor children likewise learnt their letters,
and were taught <em>to read</em>&mdash;a fact greatly at variance with the vulgar
notion of mediæval ignorance. For that this was only a poor school
is certain, from the fact of the ragged and penniless vagrant being
able to find admission into it. And having begun to speak of
the Durham poor schools, I may take this opportunity of remarking
that the city of St. Cuthbert was remarkably well supplied with them.
For besides her parochial schools, she possessed an excellent monastic
poor school, which continued to flourish down to the time of
the Reformation. The usages of monastic bodies underwent so little
alteration in the lapse of centuries that the description of this school,
as it existed at the time of its suppression, probably gives us a sufficiently
accurate notion of its condition in far earlier times. “There
were certain poor children, called the children of the almery, who
were educated in learning, and relieved with the alms and benevolence
of the whole house, having their meat and drink in a loft on
the north side of the abbey gates. This loft had a long slated porch
over the stairhead, and at each side of the porch were stairs to go
up to the loft, with a stable underneath.... The children went to
school at the Infirmary School, without the abbey gates, which was
founded by the priors of the abbey at the charge of the house. The
meat and drink that the children had was what the monks and novices
had left. It was carried in at a door adjoining the great kitchen
window, into a little vault at the west end of the Frater House, like
a pantry, called the <em>covie</em>, kept by a man. Within it was a window,
at which some of the children received the meat from the said man
(who was called the clerk of the covie) out of the covie window, and
carried it to the loft. This clerk waited on them at every meal to
preserve order.” The description given of the Song school attached
to Durham monastery, which, according to the same authority, was
built “many years without memory of man, before the suppression of
the house,” is worth quoting, as showing that the material comfort of
the pupils was not uncared for. It was “very finely boarded round
about, a man’s height about the walls, and had a long desk from one
end of the school to the other for the books to lie on; and all the
floor was boarded under foot <em>for warmness</em>, and long forms set in the
ground for the children to sit on. And the place where the master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
sat and taught was all close boarded both behind and on either side,
<em>for warmness</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Similar schools for poor scholars were attached to all the great
abbeys, and were of a higher order with respect to learning than the
parochial schools. The pupils reared in them, though of the humblest
origin, often rose to high dignities in Church and State. John
of Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, born of a peasant’s family,
received his early education in the poor school of the Cluniac monks
of Lewes, where, many years later, Dudley, the son of a poor travelling
carpenter, was also received, and sent to Oxford by his charitable
patrons, who little foresaw the kind of renown which their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">protégé</i>
would achieve, or the evil which his descendants would bring upon
the Church. Alexander of Hales, “the Irrefragable Doctor,” as he
was called, was in like manner a pupil of the Cistercians, who, says
his biographer, “had the heroic charity to teach youth;” and it is
well known that the facilities afforded by the religious houses to poor
scholars were so great as to be regarded with much jealousy by the
feudal lords, whose pride revolted at the promotion to ecclesiastical
dignities of men who had risen from the lowest grades.</p>

<p>There will be occasion to examine our English poor schools more
closely in a future chapter, but at present we must return to Oxford,
where the collegiate system was gradually developing in its grandest
form, and the influx of the mendicant orders was introducing a
splendid era for the schools.</p>

beauty and interest as the distant view of a great city; and none in
which the reality is more thoroughly idealised in the eye of the spectator.
As he gazes at some fair assemblage of ancient towers gleaming
aloft through a framework of green boughs, and hears their far-off
chimes mingling with the nearer music of the thrush’s note, he forgets
“the loud stunning tide of human crime” which surges at their
base, and is ready to cheat himself into the pleasant fancy that he
beholds a sacred city full of venerable shrines. But if this character
of solemn beauty attaches even to our busiest capitals when seen
from a distance, much more does it belong to Oxford, the ancient
“Bellositum,” which finds no rival to compete with her in the
marvellous aspect of her</p>

<p class="noindent">Gardens, churches, and palaces shining through a vista of stately
forest trees, surrounded by green meadows and reflected in the
waters of a noble river, make up a picture which may well arrest the
eye of the artist or the poet, and suggest a dream which, if it find no
substantial reality, is yet a form of beauty evoked from the ancient
worship, carrying our thoughts to days when the sanctuaries of
Oxford were first raised for cloistered students, and when St. Edmund
and St. Richard were teaching in her schools.</p>

<p>Yet, if we were suddenly transported back to the beginning of the
thirteenth century, very little of this architectural beauty would meet
our eye. There was the castle indeed, and the spire of St Frideswide’s
priory, but they were surrounded, not as now with graceful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
colleges, but with the humble straw-thatched houses of the citizens,
and with those equally humble inns and halls of which we have
already spoken. A great oak forest separated the city from the village
of Abingdon, and was inhabited by wolves and wild boars; and
tradition preserves the story of a certain student who was
<ins class="corr" id="tn477" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Second “his” removed in “met in his walk by a ferocious boar”.">met in his walk by a ferocious boar</ins>,
which he overcame by thrusting Aristotle down the beast’s throat. The
boar, having no taste for such logic, was choked by it; and his head,
borne home in triumph, was no doubt honourably served up at table
with a sprig of rosemary in its mouth. The stately abbey of Osney,
second to none in the kingdom, would have been seen in those islet
meadows, where at present not a stone remains to mark its former
site; and its two grand towers rose among the trees, musical with
the bells which now ring out their tuneful chimes from the cathedral
spire. There were to be seen the stately quadrangle and the abbot’s
house, so often the resort of kings and papal legates; and pleasant
walks under the elm trees wound along the waterside overlooking
the stream which separated the abbey lands from those other islets
where the two orders of mendicant friars had just established
themselves.</p>

<p>The scholars were fond of such shady walks, and had laid out a
certain plot of ground which bore the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campus Martius</i>,
and was divided into several portions, according to the scholastic
degrees. One of the walks was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non ultra</i> walk, and led to a little
hill called Rome, wherein was a cave and a meander, or winding
path, and at the top thereof a cross of stone. Two clear springs were
seen at either end of this scholastic garden, appropriately bearing
the names of Plato and Aristotle. There were many other such
wells in the city, one of which was called Holy Well, over which was
raised a stately cross. Its waters were pure and intensely cold, and
were esteemed for the many cures which were wrought by them on
pious pilgrims. For Oxford drew pilgrims as well as scholars to her
holy shrines. Not only was the tomb of St. Frideswide visited by
thousands, but also her image in that little country church of Binsey,
which she is said to have founded, and which in early days was
surrounded by hawthorn woods, and was a place of recreation for
the nuns of her convent. There you may still see, not the image,
but the empty niche where it formerly stood, and the stone pavement
worn away with many feet and many knees, a relic in itself,
which we may stoop and reverently kiss; for here St. Edmund was
wont to pray; and here on certain festivals the scholars came out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
with cross and banners, and wound their way among the flowering
hawthorn woods to pay their homage to the patron saint of Oxford.</p>

<p>There was another well in St. Clement’s parish, near the old
hospital of St. Bartholomew, which claimed to have been founded by
Henry the Scholar, which was also held in much esteem. It was
one of those spots which our ancestors were wont to designate
“Gospel places,” where, on the Rogation Days, it was the custom to
read portions of the Gospel, by way of invoking a blessing on the
corn-fields, and the streams, and the fountains of water, that they
might not be infected by the power of wicked spirits. The well was
in a grove hard by St. Bartholomew’s chapel; and here came out
the students, young and old, carrying poles adorned with flowers,
and singing the canticle <cite>Benedicite</cite>, wherein they called on the
fountains and all the green things of the earth to bless the Lord.
The poor folk of the hospital made ready for them by strewing the
ground with flowers, and adorning the well itself with green boughs
and garlands. Then the Gospel was read, and the well was blessed,
and in later times an anthem, in three or more parts, was sung by
the scholars.</p>

<p>The meadows that lie around the city, through which, to use the
words of brave old Stowe, “the river passeth on to London with a
marvellous quiet course,” were then, as now, highly prized by the
scholars as places of recreation, and are as frequently alluded to in
the university histories, as the famous “Pré aux Clercs” at Paris.
But let us enter within the walls, and take a glance at the streets
with their quaint designations. “School Street” and “Logic Lane”
speak for themselves, but what can have been the origin of the
“Street of the seven deadly Sins”? Here is a very important
turning which leads to the <em>Schedeyerde</em>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vicus schediasticorum</i>.
You shudder perhaps, at the sound of such barbarous Latin; yet
had you been an Oxford scholar of good King Henry’s days, you
would very often have bent your steps hitherward: for here abode
the sellers of parchment, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">schedes</i> or sheets of which gave their
name to the locality, and here the transcribers and book merchants
carried on their traffic; and here scholars with long purses obtained
their literary wares, and those with empty ones were fain to look
and long. You can tell the schools by their pithy inscriptions, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ama
scientiam</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imposturas fuge</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litteras disce</i>, and the like, but you will
look in vain for public schools, or congregation house, or library, or
observatory, or collegiate piles. Churches, indeed, there are in plenty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
and if the tower of St. Martin’s strikes your eye by its strength and
height, you may be surprised to learn that the citizens use it as a
fortalice, and on occasion of quarrels with the students retire there
to shoot at them with stones, and bows, on which account it was
afterwards cut down to its present dumpy proportions by Edward III.
In truth, it must be confessed, the state of things in old Oxford was
anything but orderly. Not only did the northern and southern men
embrace different sides both in philosophy and politics, and fight
out their differences in the public streets, but the townsmen and the
gownsmen stood on much the same terms as those which existed of
old time between Athens and Sparta; there might be a truce between
them, but there was never a peace. The students lived, as yet
subject to no statutes and very little law, and committed many
villanies; and, on the other hand, the burghers preyed on them,
provoked them, and sometimes burnt their books.</p>

<p>We have now to watch the gradual growth into form and order
of these chaotic elements, and will pass over to the other side of the
great oak forest, and make our way to the village of Abingdon, where
the abbey which we saw founded by good St. Ethelwold had been
rebuilt by his Norman successors, and in the early days of the reign
of Henry III. was flourishing in great splendour. In the village that
had gathered round its walls there lived, at that time, a widow, named
Mabel Rich, the mother of four children, whom she brought up in
all holy living. Her husband, before his death, had put on the
monk’s cowl in the neighbouring abbey of Eynsham, whither his
eldest son had followed him; another son retired to the priory of
Boxley in Kent, whilst Mabel, in heart also a religious, remained in
the world to educate her remaining children. Growing up under the
shadow of the old cloister, by the side of a mother who trained him
in the austere practices of ancient piety, Edmund Rich was steeped
from childhood in the spirit of Catholic devotion. He assisted with
Mabel at the midnight office in the abbey, he learnt the Psalter from
her lips; and his soul gradually received that beautiful mould which
we have again and again admired in the scholars of old time, and
which perhaps found in him its most perfect realisation. At twelve
years old he went to Oxford, and it is his own brother, Robert Rich,
who tells us how, at that time, going out into the meadows in order
to withdraw himself from the boisterous play of his companions, the
Child Jesus appeared to him, and saluted him with the words “Hail,
beloved one!” And he, wondering at the beauty of the Child,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
replied, “Who are you, for to me you are certainly unknown?”
Then said the Child, “How comes it that I am unknown to thee,
seeing that I sit by thy side at school, and wherever thou art, there
also do I accompany thee? Look in My face and see what is there
written.” Edmund looked and saw the words, “Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews.” “This is My name,” said the Child, “write it
on thy forehead every night, and it shall protect thee from sudden
death.” Then He disappeared, on Whom the Angels desire to look,
leaving the other with a sweetness in his heart passing that of honey.</p>

<p>From Oxford Edmund proceeded to Paris, where we have already
seen something of his manner of life. He seems to have studied
more than once at both universities, and also at Merton abbey, then
a great seat of learning. As soon as he had taken his master’s
degree, he opened a school of his own on the spot now occupied
by St. Edmund’s Hall. The favourite maxim he was accustomed to
give to his pupils, was this: “Study as if you were to live for ever, live
as if you were to die to-morrow.” For himself, he heard Mass daily,
attended matins in the nearest parish church, and recited the
canonical hours before beginning his lectures. And to satisfy his
devotion with the greater convenience, he spent part of his slender
patrimony in the erection of a Lady chapel attached to St. Peter’s
church, where he and his pupils regularly recited the Divine office.
It must be remembered, that at this period Oxford possessed none of
those colleges and collegiate chapels, in which the Church office was
afterwards celebrated with so much splendour; but the custom, introduced
for the first time by St. Edmund, was soon followed by other
students. Those who love the memory of the holy scholar may still
visit his chapel, which looks desolate enough, with its once delicate
lancet windows walled up; yet it is something to know the spots where
saints have prayed.</p>

<p>Did we know St. Edmund only by the records left us of his tender
piety, his singular devotion to our Blessed Lady, and his manifold
austerities, we might picture him as some contemplative saint, whose
thoughts were wholly withdrawn from the world, and fixed on unseen
things. Yet he was a scholar and a teacher; a close logician, and a
great lover of mathematics. Wood says that he was the first who
publicly read some of Aristotle’s Treatises at Oxford, and for six
years after the opening of his school he continued to lecture on arts.
The circumstance which led to his exchanging these studies for that
of theology is thus told by his biographer: “After he had taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
the liberal arts for six years, and was reading geometry with his
pupils, his mother one night appeared to him as he slept, saying:
‘What is it, my son, that you read and teach, and what are those
figures over which you are poring so intently?’ He replied, that
they were the figures of geometry, on which she took his hand in hers,
and drew thereon three circles, at the same time naming the three
Divine Persons&mdash;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Then she added,
‘These are the figures which you must henceforth study.’” From
that time he applied himself exclusively to the sacred sciences, and
that with greater ardour than he had hitherto bestowed on secular
learning. He hardly gave himself time for sleep and refreshment,
but studied night and day. An ivory crucifix, with the mysteries of
our redemption carved round it, was always on his table when he
read, and to it from time to time he directed his eyes, feeding his
heart the while with pious ejaculations. He never went to bed,
but took his scanty rest on the floor, or in his chair, and was at his
books again as soon as the morning dawned. Does this intense
application seem excessive? and does any reader conceive a distrust
of such absorbing studies? Let them learn that at this very time
St. Edmund sold all his books, to supply the wants of some poor
scholars whom he had no other means of relieving, and seems to
have been indebted to a charitable friend for the gift of a Bible,
which afterwards formed his principal study.</p>

<p>After some years, having taken his doctor’s degree, he once more
began to teach; and strange and beautiful were the scenes in that
saintly lecture-room, where the master was often rapt in ecstacy, and
the scholars were fain to shut up their note-books, being too much
blinded with their tears to use them. Wood mentions the tradition,
common at Oxford, that an angel, in the form of a beautiful youth,
was often seen standing by his side while he spoke, a legend which
at least shows in what sort of esteem he was held by his scholars.
Among them were St. Sewall, afterwards Archbishop of York, St.
Richard of Chichester, Stephen Lexington, and Robert Grosteste, all
of whom took part in the great intellectual movement shortly afterwards
set on foot at Oxford by the mendicant friars. He did not make
much profit out of his school, for the money he received from his
pupils was either spent in charity, or suffered to lie loose on his window
sill, where he would strew it over with ashes, saying, “Ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.” Any one might take it who chose, and his friends
did so sometimes, to see what he would say; but he asked no account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
of it, and no persuasion would ever induce him to keep it under lock
and key. He was not the mere professor, whose care of his pupils
ceased when they left his lecture-room. He nursed them when they
were sick, and relieved them when they were in want; and they in
their turn loved to gather up each trait of their beloved master, and
handed down to those who came after them the portraiture of the
saint, with his beautiful countenance, the pallor of which became of
a fair shining red when he spoke of God or holy things, in his grey
scholar’s gown, which was poor without meanness, for he was wont
to say that a clerk should remember that his state was an honourable
one, and that his appearance, if simple, should never be abject.</p>

<p>St. Edmund had a real love for the work of teaching, and several
times when he had been persuaded to accept of benefices, he resigned
them in order to return to Oxford. At last, however, we find him
treasurer of Salisbury; and with his habits, a very strange treasurer
he must have made. And in 1234 he became Archbishop of
Canterbury. We need not follow the history of his troublous
primacy; he fared the usual fate of English primates who resisted
the tyranny of Plantagenet kings; and six years later was an exile at
Pontigny, living among the Cistercian monks as one of themselves,
writing his “Mirror of the Church,” and preparing for his end. He
did not die at Pontigny, however, but at Soissy, whither they brought
him in hopes that the cooler air might revive his exhausted strength.
His last days were spent in giving alms to the poor pilgrims who
passed that way, and when he was too feeble to rise from his chair
and go to the gate, he made one of his chaplains take his place, and
give to all who came. His last words are preserved, the words he
pronounced with outstretched hands, when about to receive the Holy
Viaticum:&mdash;“Lord, thou art He in whom I have believed, whom I
have preached, whom I have truly taught: and Thou art my witness
that while I have been on earth, I have sought nothing else besides
Thee. And as Thou knowest that I will only what Thou willest, so
now I say, Thy will be done.” “All the rest of that day,” says his
biographer, “he was joyful and even gay; you would not have
thought he was suffering from sickness; and many wondered to see
him thus. The tears of devotion were indeed in his eyes, but his
beautiful countenance manifested the serenity that filled his heart.
There was no sign of approaching death; and at the last moment,
neither sigh nor death-rattle was heard; he did not even sink back
on his bed, as dying persons are wont to do, but remained sitting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
and so gently expired, leaning his head upon his hand.” Pontigny
keeps his dust as her most precious treasure, and even in our own
day, such a strange attractive power is possessed by the sacred relics
of the saints, that a newly-founded religious congregation has selected
its desolate church for the site of their mother house, with the view
of obtaining for their apostolic work the blessing of <em>Saint Edmé</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if England had cast out her holy primate, Oxford had
not forgotten her doctor. The work he had begun in his schools
was carried on by the band of scholars whom he had trained and left
behind him. Five years before he left the university, the two orders
of mendicant friars had been established in the town. The first
colony of the Franciscans was sent thither in 1220, by Brother
Agnellus, who soon after came himself, and caused a decent school
to be built, in which he induced Master Robert Grosteste to deliver
his lectures. Grosteste was at that time the most illustrious doctor
of the university, and soon brought the Franciscan schools into high
repute. Agnellus, though himself unlearned, was most desirous that
the studies of his brethren should be amply provided for, and often
visited the schools to watch their progress. One day, to his great
surprise, he found them disputing on the thesis, “Whether there be a
God.” Whereon he cried out in great distress, “Alas, alas! simple
friars penetrate the heavens, while the learned are disputing if there
be a God.” With these words he left the school “in a chafe,” says
Wood, “to think he had built it for such debates,” but, becoming a
little calmer, sent the sum of ten marks to Rome to buy a correct
copy of the Decretals, charging his friars to apply themselves wholly
to the study thereof, and to lay aside questions of sophistry and
foolish babbling.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed from this story that the learning encouraged
at the university by Grosteste was entirely of that disputatious
and empty kind which had become fashionable in the schools since
the time of Abelard. Grosteste, if he exercised the friars in such
scholastic disputations, was himself a decided advocate of the older
learning, and may be regarded as, in the main, a disciple of the school
of St. Victor. When chancellor of the university, he used his influence
to promote the study of positive theology, and of that Biblical learning
in which he was himself a proficient. One of his modern biographers
has candidly admitted that “his wonderful knowledge of Scripture
might probably be worthy of remark in our day, though in his own
not more than was possessed by all theological students.” But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
Grosteste had largeness of mind enough to appreciate the value of
the scholastic method at the same time that he laboured to prevent
the study of the Scriptures and the liberal arts from falling into decay;
and he probably found means of satisfying Brother Agnellus on this
point, for whatever use was made of the copy of the Decretals, it is
quite certain that the friars did not “apply themselves wholly” to
them, or lay aside their scholastic exercises. On the contrary, Fuller
tells us that they soon beat all their competitors in school divinity,
“out of all distance;” and Wood adds to his narrative as given above,
that Grosteste was not superficial in his performances, and that under
him the friars made extraordinary advances both in disputation and
preaching.</p>

<p>The great esteem in which Grosteste held the Franciscans led him,
not only to teach in their schools, but to persuade other first-rate
regents to do the same; besides which, he induced several of his own
personal friends to enter the order, among whom was Adam Marsh,
the parish priest of Wearmouth, better known by his Italian name of
Adam de Marisco, who is reckoned as the first regular professor of the
order at Oxford, and was known as “the Illustrious Doctor,” and
Roger Bacon, the wonder of his age, and the greatest natural
philosopher who appeared in England before the time of Newton.
Besides these, the Franciscans were joined by a crowd of other
illustrious novices, such as John Wallis, surnamed the “Tree of Life,”
Alexander of Hales, Haymo of Feversham, and more than one
Benedictine and Augustinian abbot, which latter circumstance has
greatly excited the spleen of Matthew Paris.</p>

<p>Grosteste, after for some time filling the office of chancellor,
became Bishop of Lincoln in 1235, in which capacity he was still
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i> head of the university, and continued to keep up an active
interest in its affairs. Among his letters is one addressed to the
regents of Oxford, in which he gives them much useful advice as to
the regulation of their studies. “Let the foundation-stones be well
laid,” he says, “on them the whole building rests. The morning is
the best time for study, and the good old Paris custom should be
observed of reserving those early hours for the lectures on Scripture,
giving the later part of the day to other subjects.” Even when treating
of questions altogether unconnected with natural science, his love
of it peeps out in spite of himself, as in the passage where he gracefully
compares the difference between direct and delegated authority
to the different powers of the sun’s rays when falling direct, or reflected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
from a mirror. He was undoubtedly one of the greatest men of his
time, a universal genius, and revered by his countrymen as a saint.
After his death, the university united with the king in petitioning for
his canonisation, and sent a document to Rome, in which it is
declared “that the said Robert never left undone any good action
pertaining to his state and office for fear of any man, but was rather
prepared for martyrdom should the sword of the assassin have fallen
upon him. Likewise, the university certifieth of his splendid learning,
and that he most admirably governed Oxford, in his degree of doctor
of holy theology, and was illustrious for many miracles after his death,
wherefore he is named by the mouth of all men, ‘Holy Robert.’” He
may, in fact, be regarded as, in his own time, the representative of
the university, and hence it is of particular importance to ascertain
what the studies were which he followed and promoted. As a
theologian, he belonged rather to the mystic than the speculative
school, and as a scholar he was a warm upholder of the liberal arts,
doing his utmost to encourage the study, not only of the Latin classics,
but also of Greek and Hebrew. He translated the works of St.
Dionysius the Areopagite, and, to facilitate the study of Greek, is
also said to have translated the Lexicon of Suidas. He promoted
two ecclesiastics who are likewise known to have been Greek scholars:
John Basing, archdeacon of St. Alban’s, who in 1240 returned from
Athens laden with Greek manuscripts, and Nicholas, chaplain to the
abbot of St. Alban’s, surnamed <em>Græcus</em>, who assisted the bishop in
some of his translations. He is also said to have been acquainted
with Hebrew. But his skill in the learned tongues formed but a
small part of Grosteste’s acquirements. He was a mathematician, a
poet, a musician, and a philosopher. Among the two hundred
treatises of various kinds which he left behind him are to be found,
besides his theological writings, works on the sphere, on physical
science, husbandry, political economy, medicine, and music; commentaries
on Aristotle and Boëthius, and Norman-French poems.
Of these last, one is entitled the “Château d’Amour,” a name he
bestows on the Blessed Virgin, and consists of a religious romance
on the fall and redemption of man. This, together with his “Manuel
des Péchés,” was translated in the following reign into English verse,
by Robert Manning, who, in the prologue to his poem, alludes to

<p>Most readers are aware that Grosteste is commonly represented as
an enemy to papal supremacy, and is rather favourably treated, in
consequence, by some historians who find great consolation in the
thought that he died excommunicate. That he opposed the nomination
of foreigners to English benefices, and that in very bold language,
is quite certain, but the rest of the story belongs to our mediæval
myths. It is supposed to have been conjured out of the anathemas
attached to the Bull of provisors, the execution of which he resisted.
It is scarcely necessary to observe that petitions would hardly have
been presented to the Holy See in the next reign for the canonisation
of one who had died under the censures of the Church, and in these
petitions there is not to be found the smallest allusion to his having
even incurred any sort of disgrace. More than this, Wood tells us
that just before the death of Innocent IV., that Pontiff granted to the
university four new Bulls containing great privileges, which had been
procured <em>through the interest of Grosteste</em>. In point of fact, however
bold and uncompromising he may have been in resisting what he
deemed a practical abuse, there was no English Divine who ever
expressed himself with more hearty loyalty towards the chair of St.
Peter than “Holy Robert.” He plainly declared that to refuse
obedience to the Supreme Pastor was “as the sin of witchcraft and
idolatry,” and even Mr. Berington is forced to allow that his language
regarding the authority of the Holy See is so “adulatory,” that the
attempt to rank him among its enemies must be deemed a total
failure.</p>

<p>It would carry us too far to attempt anything like a particular
account of the Franciscan scholars, who flourished at Oxford during
the time of Grosteste. One among them, it need hardly be said,
towers above all the rest, his celebrity having survived undiminished
to our own day. Roger Bacon, a west countryman by birth, and a
pupil of St. Edmund’s, had passed from Oxford to Paris, where he
received his doctor’s degree, and then returning to the English
university, spent forty years of his life in studying and lecturing upon
the sciences. He had acquired the Greek, Hebrew, and Oriental
languages in Paris, and wrote grammars of the two first-named tongues
which are said to be preserved in MS. at St. Peter’s College, Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
But it was as a natural philosopher that he chiefly distinguished
himself above his contemporaries, and anticipated the discoveries
of later science. At this time the physical sciences were
chiefly cultivated by the Arabians, who presented them in a mystic
and fanciful shape, which did not render them less acceptable to
mediæval students. The study of physics was understood to include
mathematics, alchemy, astrology, medicine, and mechanics, each of
which received its own colouring of romance. Thus a certain
Arabian physician put forth the theory that medicines could only be
properly mixed according to the principles of music, and no one
ventured to doubt the connection of astronomy with the medical
science. Bacon was certainly not less credulous than his contemporaries,
but he was more experimental, and hence, though he does
not seem to have done much towards establishing truer scientific
principles, he obtained many brilliant results. The long list of his
writings includes treatises on Optics (then called Perspective),
Mathematics, Chemistry, Arithmetic, Astronomy, the Tides, and the
Reformation of the Calendar; and, as is well known, he was
familiar with the properties of mirrors, and appears to have been
acquainted with the principle both of the microscope and the
telescope, and with the powers of steam and of gunpowder. It is
not to be doubted that he was greatly in advance of his age in
scientific knowledge, and it was probably his skill in the use of
optical and mechanical instruments, which earned for him the vulgar
reputation of dealing in magic. Charges of this sort are commonly
enough explained as arising out of the ignorance of the multitudes,
who thought every man who could read Greek to be possessed of unlawful
knowledge. But besides the awe with which a semibarbarous
age naturally regarded one possessed of secrets not revealed to the
vulgar herd, it must be remembered that Bacon’s science sometimes
clothed itself in very suspicious language. He declared that his
wonderful tube possessed the power of beholding, not <em>distant objects</em>
only, but <em>future events</em>; and his enthusiastic language in praise of his
favourite science may read to us as simple nonsense, but was
understood in his own day to imply something very like a magic art.
He was not a whit less disposed than his contemporaries to credit
the wildest theories of the alchemists, but believed in the possibility
of contriving lamps that should burn for ever, magic crystals, the
elixir of life, and the philosopher’s stone, and wrote treatises on the
two last-named subjects. It is plain, indeed, that he only expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
to realise these schemes by an application of the secret powers of
nature, and not by any forbidden arts. Yet it sounded startling to
simple ears to hear of schemes whereby one man might draw a
thousand to himself, might raise himself into the air and fly, or manage
a ship with his single arm; not to speak of his boastful offer to teach
any man Hebrew in three days, Greek in another three, and the
whole course of arithmetic and geometry in a week.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Unfavourable
rumours having reached the ears of Jerome of Ascoli, then general
of his order, he was prohibited from teaching, and for a time
imprisoned; but in 1264, Cardinal Fulcodi, formerly legate in
England, becoming Pope under the title of Clement IV., Bacon
despatched to Rome his favourite disciple, John of London, who
placed in the Pontiff’s hands all his master’s books and instruments,
an examination of which appears to have justified him in the opinion
of his judges. Clement bestowed great marks of favour both on the
master and scholar, and it was at his suggestion that Bacon made
that collection of his chief philosophical views which is known as
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opus Majus</i>. When Jerome of Ascoli himself became Pope
Nicholas IV., Bacon was again imprisoned, but as Wood shows, the
assertion that he died in confinement during the pontificate of
Nicholas is clearly an error, for his death did not take place till 1292,
he having survived the Pope four years, and having before his death
recovered his liberty, and published several theological works.</p>

<p>The only other Oxford Franciscan who must be mentioned in this
place, is Nicholas de Lyra, whose claim to be regarded as a native
of this country is not, indeed, undisputed, though it rests on the
respectable authority of Trithemius, Sixtus of Sienna, and a majority
of writers. The Flemings assert that he was born at Lyre in Brabant,
the French as peremptorily declare him a native of Lyra in Normandy,
and the English author of the <cite>Collectanea Anglo-Minoritica</cite>, will have
it that his real name was <em>Harper</em>, Latinised after the fashion of the
day into <em>Lyra</em>. Equal uncertainty rests on the point whether he
were by birth a Christian or a Jew, the common belief inclining to
the view that he was the son of Jewish parents, though this fact is
hard to reconcile with the assertion of his biographers, that he only
began the study of Hebrew at an advanced age. But whatever doubt
hangs over his origin, none exists as to the position he held among
the scholars of the day. Biblical learning and the study of the
Scriptural tongues had not quite fallen into decay, when the age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
could produce the author of the “Scholastic Postils,” a commentary
upon every part of the Sacred Volume, which was the first commentary
on the Scripture ever printed. Nicholas de Lyra had studied at
the Universities of Paris and Oxford, and if it be true, as is asserted,
that he did not apply himself to Greek and Hebrew learning until
after his entrance into the Franciscan Order, we must allow his
erudition to have been gained in the university schools. Whether
himself a Jewish convert or not, his labours are said to have been
undertaken in the first instance with a view to the conversion of that
unhappy people, a work which, in the thirteenth century, engaged the
attention of the most illustrious divines. By his writings, disputations,
and sermons, Nicholas is said to have converted six thousand Jews
to the faith. But his great work was far from being exclusively
intended for their instruction; it became the Text Book of Biblical
students, an indispensable part of every cathedral and monastic
library, and laid down rules for the safe interpretation of Scripture
based upon the right intelligence of the literal sense. It must be
added, to the honour of English scholarship, that this important
work, which fills five folio volumes, was first published at the expense
of a private London citizen, and that the money paid for copying
it amounted to 670 florins. Its composition occupied the author
thirty-seven years, for, as he himself declares, it was begun in 1293,
and not completed until 1330.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to an Oxford scholar of a different stamp, whose
name, inseparably united to that of St. Edmund, almost closes the
catalogue of our English Saints. Born of respectable parents, who
owned the lands of Burford, near the little town of Wyche, in
Worcestershire, Richard had very early given evidence of a scholar’s
tastes, and the first fact which his biographer, Ralph Bocking,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> records
regarding him, is his determined refusal to be drawn away from his
books to join in any of the village dances and revelries. But a hard
fortune left him little hopes of being able to devote his life to books
and learning. The death of his father, and the mismanagement of
the guardians to whose care he and his brothers were consigned,
reduced the family to extreme poverty. And Richard, with generous
self-devotion, gave up all his own cherished plans, and entered his
elder brother’s service in order, by a life of vigorous labour, to put
the affairs of the family on a better footing. “He served him,” says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
Bocking, “in poverty and abjection, and that for many years; working,
now with the plough and now with the cart, and enduring many
other kinds of hard and humble toil, patiently and modestly.”
Richard’s memory was long preserved and revered in his native
place, and even down to the time of the great Rebellion, the Droitwich
peasantry put on their best clothes on St. Richard’s day, and went
to decorate with boughs and flowers a certain well dedicated to the
Worcestershire saint. Aubrey, who notices this circumstance,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
informs us that St. Richard was a person of good estate, and “a
brisk young fellow that would ride over hedge and ditch;” a description
which, quaint as it is, expresses well enough one feature in
his thoroughly English character. He was not a dreamer or a bookworm;
he did nothing by halves, and his strong, manly nature loved
the practical side of everything. As a Worcestershire farmer he was
just as ready to ride over hedge and ditch when that was needed, as
he was, when bishop, to do his pastoral work in the guise of a poor
beggar. The future chancellor of Oxford began life, in short, as a
simple yeoman. His energy and perseverance had their reward, and
in a few years his brother’s lands, well tilled and managed, began to
yield an ample revenue. But when a prosperous fortune seemed
opening before him, he refused every offer made him by his kinsfolk,
and as soon as his self-imposed task was over, he bade farewell to
his Worcestershire home, and betook himself to Oxford, whence,
after a time, he passed on to Paris. In both universities he led the
hard and mortified life of a poor scholar. For it must be remembered
that this was before the time of colleges; it was the golden age when
Oxford numbered her thirty thousand scholars, most of whom had
scanty means of subsistence. Some were supported by the alms of
private individuals, others by the great abbeys of Eynsham and
Osney, which on certain festival days, bound themselves to regale
the poor scholars with “honest refection.” Others went about begging
and singing the “Salve Regina” at the doors of the citizens, well
content to receive by way of payment a dish of broken meat from
the rich man’s table. Every one will remember the picture drawn,
many years later, by Chaucer, who describes the clerke of Oxenforde
in his threadbare doublet, who would rather have</p>

<p>The account that Bocking gives of St. Richard’s student life is
hardly less graphic. Like the poor Cambridge scholar before spoken
of, who had to run about to keep his feet warm, Richard never saw
a fire. But, unlike him, he was seldom able to afford himself the
luxury of <em>beef</em> or even <em>mutton</em>, then reckoned as ordinary “scholar’s
fare.” “So entirely,” says Bocking, “was he carried away with the
love of learning, that he gave but little thought to the necessities of
the body. For, as he used afterwards to relate, having two companions
with him in his poor chamber, the three had but one tunic
each, and one hooded gown between them. One of them at a time,
therefore, put on the gown and went to hear the lectures, leaving the
other two in their lodgings, after which they in their turn put on the
gown and so went to lecture. Their food was bread, with a very
little wine, and salad, or other such poor sort of viands. For then
poverty did not allow them to eat flesh or fish except on Sundays
and high days, or when any friends were their guests. Nevertheless,
the saint was wont to affirm that no period of his life had ever been
more joyful and delightful.” His love of Oxford induced him to
return thither a second time, instead of taking his master’s degree
at Paris; and for some years after graduating at the English university
he taught in his own school, “liberally dispensing to others
what he had himself acquired.” After a while he repaired to Bologna,
and there spent seven years in the study of the canon law. And in
1235 we find him once more at Oxford, where he was unanimously
chosen Chancellor of the University. He does not seem to have
filled this office for any great length of time, for Robert Grosteste
and St. Edmund of Canterbury were both anxious to draw him to
their respective dioceses, St. Edmund succeeded, and appointed
him his chancellor, and a close friendship sprang up between the
two saints, which is thus eloquently described by Bocking:&mdash;“In all
things,” he says, “Richard had an eye to the peace and quiet of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
lord and archbishop, who, as he knew, had chosen Mary’s better part.
And the archbishop exceedingly rejoiced that by the discreet affection
and loving discretion of his chancellor he was saved from the
tumult of outward business; while the chancellor was in like manner
glad to learn from the holy and heavenly conversation of his prelate.
Each leaned on each, the saint on the saint, the master on the
disciple, the disciple on the master, the father on the son, and the
son on the father. To one who looked on them religiously, they
seemed like the two cherubim stretching their wings over the ark of
the Lord&mdash;the church of Canterbury; each with holy eye gazing on
the other, and touching each other with the wings of holy love;
their faces, that is, their wills, ever turned towards the Mercy-seat.”</p>

<p>Richard followed his friend into exile, and was with him both at
Pontigny and at Soissy, where he died. Up to that time St. Richard
had not given much time to the study of theology, and had only
received minor orders on his appointment to the Chancellorship of
Canterbury. He had made himself known rather as a man of
practical sense than of profound intellect, and the tie that bound him
to St. Edmund drew something of its strength from the very contrast
of their natural characters. But the snapping of that bond was the
heart wound destined to draw St. Richard to yet more excellent
things. The tree must be pierced to give out its most precious
balm, the leaf must be bruised to yield its fragrant odours. The
strong, manly heart of the Worcestershire yeoman was bowed in
anguish over Edmund’s grave; but the anguish softened, refined,
and elevated his nature; it drew heaven nearer to him, and him
nearer to heaven; so that, conceiving a distaste for all secular
studies, he retired to Orleans, and set himself to study theology in
the convent of Dominican Friars.</p>

<p>This was not his first acquaintance with the Friar Preachers, who
had established themselves in the Jews’ quarter of Oxford before St.
Richard’s residence there as Chancellor. The excellence of their
theological schools was therefore well known to him; and after
studying with them for two or three years, and receiving ordination
as a priest from the hands of the Bishop of Orleans, he returned to
England, and for some time exercised the office of parish priest of
Deal. Boniface of Savoy, the successor of St. Edmund in the
primacy, soon found him out, and compelled him to resume the
office of chancellor; but, before doing so, Richard, whose desire was
to lead a poor and apostolic life, took a vow to join the Dominican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
Order, trusting that such an obligation would stand in the way of his
retaining any public dignity. He was never able actually to fulfil
this vow; yet, as Bocking remarks, the after circumstances of his
life may be regarded as a sort of virtual accomplishment of it,
“inasmuch as for many years he led the life of a true Friar Preacher,
preaching Jesus Christ in poverty, and labouring for the salvation of
souls, stripped of all worldly possessions.”</p>

<p>In 1244 the unwelcome news reached him that he was elected
Bishop of Chichester; but king Henry III., enraged that the canons
had rejected his own unworthy minister and nominee, Robert
Passelew, revenged himself by seizing the temporalities of the see;
and when an appeal to Rome resulted in the confirmation of St.
Richard’s election, the new bishop, compelled by obedience to accept
the weighty charge, and consecrated at Rome by the Pope’s own
hand, returned to England to find his manors confiscated and an
edict published forbidding any man to assist him even with a loan.
This may be taken as a fair specimen of the system steadily pursued
by the English kings against the Church, from the Conquest to the
Reformation; and if such examples may be adduced from the policy
of him who was avowedly the most pious and least ferocious of the
Plantagenets, we may judge what sort of measure was dealt to English
prelates by sovereigns of more tyrannic temper. In his younger days
St. Richard might probably have repelled the royal injustice with the
bold courage of St. Thomas; he preferred now to meet it in the
spirit of patient endurance, and taking up his residence with a poor
priest of his diocese, gave England an example no less sublime than
that of her martyred primate. Utterly penniless, and as dependent
on the alms of the faithful as the poorest beggar, St. Richard did not
on that account neglect his flock. Like a true apostle he journeyed
on foot over the downs of Sussex, visiting in turns every remote
village, and exercising the Pastoral office with a vigorous hand that
stood in no need of courtly splendour to enforce its authority. A
poor priest of Ferring, named Simon, gave him hospitality, and there,
in the intervals of his toilsome journeys the bishop recreated himself
with gardening, and displayed the skill in budding and grafting which
he had acquired during his yeoman’s life in Worcestershire. Simon
regarded the plants which the bishop tended as sacred relics, and
was greatly distressed when one of the grafts was destroyed by
a beast which broke through the garden fence. The next time that
Richard visited Ferring he good-naturedly consoled his host by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
putting in another graft, which that same year bore flowers and fruit.
It was during this time of outlawry and humiliation that he published
his Constitutions for the reform of his diocese, in which he made
special provision for the instruction of the poor. At last, about 1247,
king Henry was forced by the threat of excommunication, to restore
the temporalities, and Richard was joyfully welcomed to his Cathedral
city. But his private habits underwent no change. He adhered to
his old Oxford fare of bread and a little wine; he seldom touched
flesh, and if delicacies, such as lambs or young chickens were placed
on his table, would exclaim, “Poor innocents; what have ye done
to deserve death! Could ye but speak, ye would surely blame our
gluttony!” He rose with the lark, to say his office in the silent
early hours; and if it so fell out that the birds had begun their
matin-song before him, it mortified him: “Shame on me!” he would
say, “that I have allowed these irrational creatures to be beforehand
with me in singing God’s praises!” His hand was ever open
to poor scholars, and he would take the silver goblets off his table to
supply their needs. His whole life presents us with a succession of
beautiful, homely, and pathetic scenes, which display to us a character
wherein pastoral firmness, scholarlike acuteness, and rustic simplicity
are blended together, all bound and beautified by the spirit of patience,
humility, and prayer. At one time we find him baptizing a Jew
whom he has converted by his learning; at another, preaching the
Crusade on the Sussex sea-coast to the rough sailors who flock to
hear his simple, energetic eloquence. It was whilst engaged in this
last work that he was called to his reward. He died in 1252 at St.
Mary’s Hospital at Dover, where he had just consecrated a church
in honour of St. Edmund. In his last moments his thoughts wandered
back to the Convent of Orleans, and with his parting breath he
repeated the invocation, which he had so often heard repeated by
the white-robed Friars:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the English Friar Preachers, to whom St. Richard in heart at
least may be said to have belonged, and of their position in the
university, something must now be said. It was on the feast of the
Assumption 1221, that they first arrived at Oxford, and obtained
from the canons of St. Frideswide a settlement in the Jews’ quarter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
of the town, where it was hoped that their learning and their preaching
might win many converts. From Elizabeth Vere, countess of
Oxford, they obtained a piece of ground on which they erected their
first schools, known as St. Edward’s schools, where the first lecturers
were the two friends Robert Bacon and Richard Fishacre, both of
them old pupils of St. Edmund, of whom Matthew Paris says that
England had no greater men living. The resort of scholars soon
obliged them to choose some more commodious site and in 1259
they removed to St. Ebbe’s island in the south suburb, another
adjoining island being occupied by the Franciscans. The extraordinary
popularity enjoyed by the Dominican Order during the first
century of its establishment in England is attested by every historical
document. The lower classes loved them for taking the popular
side in politics, while the nobles were no less forward in appreciating
their merits. It became a coveted privilege to be buried in
their churches, and Wood says that even in his day skeletons and
hearts encased in lead were continually being disinterred from the
ground formerly occupied at Oxford by the Dominican convent,
supposed to be those of devout clients of the order. However, in
spite of all this, they had their enemies, especially among the secular
regents, who were jealous of their privileges, their popularity, and
possibly also of their learning. In 1360 Richard, afterwards Archbishop
of Armagh, being elected Chancellor of Oxford, was despatched
by a certain party of the Oxford doctors to Rome, to lay a formal
complaint before the Pope of the alleged delinquencies of the friars.
One of his complaints was, oddly enough, their perseverance in collecting
libraries; if he was to be believed, no one could now procure
any books at Oxford on canon law, arts, or theology; they were all
bought up by these insatiable friars, a charge which at least sets
them in the light of being favourers of learning. The chancellor’s
mission proved utterly fruitless, a result which Ayliffe attributes to
the fact that “they had money wherewith to purchase the Pope’s
protection.” This last-named writer, in common with most of the
Post-Reformation writers, labours hard to affix the stigma of ignorance
on the mendicant orders, which he denominates as locusts and
caterpillars, who devoured the vital parts of learning, and involved
the Oxford students in a fog of darkness but partly dispelled by
“the daybreak of Wickliffe’s doctrine.” Even their vast libraries
were collected, he assures us, only to lock up the treasures of
knowledge from other men, and to become the food of moths and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
worms. And here is perhaps the place to notice the grave accusations
brought against the Christian schoolmen in general, and the
mendicants in particular, of bringing in a reign of literary barbarism.
Fleury devotes a considerable part of his fifth discourse to this
subject, and the German critics, especially Meiners, can never find
enough to say condemnatory of the scholastic jargon. Hallam
adopts the same line, and assures us that “the return of ignorance
was chiefly owing to those worse vermin, the mendicant friars, who
filled all Europe with stupid superstition.” Whether this is the best
specimen that a man of letters could give of refined and polished
diction may be questioned, but he goes on to remark (in a sentence
which, considering the zeal of its writer for grammatical accuracy,
exhibits a rather remarkable confusion of tenses),&mdash;“the writers of
the thirteenth century display an incredible ignorance, not only of
pure idiom, but of the common grammatical rules. Those who
<em>attempted</em> to write verse <em>have lost</em> all prosody, and <em>relapse</em> into Leonine
rhymes and barbarous acrostics. The historians use a hybrid jargon
intermixed with modern words. The scholastic philosophers wholly
neglected their style, and thought it no wrong to enrich the Latin,
as in some degree a living language, with terms that seemed to
express their meaning.... Duns Scotus and his followers in
the next century carried this much further, and introduced a most
barbarous and unintelligible terminology, by which the school metaphysics
were rendered ridiculous in the revival of literature.”</p>

<p>That the thirteenth century witnessed a great decay of Latinity is not
to be denied, though, as has been before shown, this decay and the
neglect of classical studies had set in before the rise of the mendicant
orders and is in no way to be attributed to them. Oxford enjoyed
the reputation of talking the very worst Latin in Europe, whence
arose the proverb, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oxoniensis loquendi mos</i>. Certainly, if the
grammatical errors condemned in the visitation articles of John of
Peckham, as reported by Wood, were common in the schools, there
is not much to be said in their defence. The prevalence of law
studies, too, helped on the decline of rhetoric, for the diction of the
jurists was, if possible, worse than that of the scholastics; and the
inferiority, apparent during the reign of Edward II., in the schools of
divinity, philosophy, and arts, is attributed by the learned Dominican,
Holcot, to the over-abundance of law lectures. Granting, however, a
full share in the corruption of Latinity to have been the work of the
schoolmen, it is difficult to understand how they can be said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
committed a “wrong” by “enriching the Latin with terms which
seemed to convey their meaning.” It is usually supposed to be the
object of language to convey one’s thoughts, and writers who had to
express the nice distinctions of Christian theology would have been
puzzled had they been bound to confine themselves to the Ciceronian
phraseology. They did, therefore, what Cicero himself had done
before them, and coined words and idioms to express ideas which
were not current in the Augustan age. The writings of the scholastics
must be regarded as in some sort scientific works, in which the
object was not elegance of style, but accuracy of sense. We are not,
therefore, necessarily to conclude that the Latin of Duns Scotus was
an example of the best that the age could produce; on the contrary,
many instances might be cited to prove that even this unfortunate
thirteenth century possessed scholars whose Latin was at least as
pure as the English of some of their critics. Thus the Bull of
Gregory X. for the canonisation of St. Louis, is cited by M. Artaud,
the biographer of Dante, as “a very model of pure Latinity.” Cicero’s
Rhetoric was so far from being devoured by the moths, that it was
almost the very first work chosen for translation into Italian prose,
and appeared in the vulgar idiom in 1257, the translator being
Galeotto, the professor of grammar at the university of Bologna.
But, putting aside all exceptional cases of those who still studied and
imitated the classics, may we not reasonably complain of the narrowness
of that criticism which stigmatises as barbarous everything which
does not belong to one style, or reflect the phraseology of one
arbitrarily chosen period? “It is strange,” observes Rohrbacher,
“that every one supposes and repeats that the scholastics and the
cloisters of the Middle Ages produced no book capable of pleasing
the world and becoming popular; and yet, for centuries past, the
world has read and delighted in a book of scholastic morality,
composed in the Middle Ages by a monkish superior for the use of
his novices, and that this book which has been read, known, and
admired by everybody, is especially a popular book; and has been
translated into every language, and gone through thousands of
editions.” He is speaking of the <em>Following of Christ</em>, which, according
to very probable conjectures, appears to have been composed in the
thirteenth century, by John Gersen of Cabanaco, abbot of the Benedictine
abbey of St. Stephen, at Vercelli.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span></p>

<p>Again: among the writers who displayed such incredible ignorance
as to write Leonine verse were the authors of a sacred poetic
literature which will defy all the attacks of time, and which no
classic revival can ever render obsolete. The “Dies Iræ,” the
“Ave Maris Stella,” the “Stabat Mater,” the “Veni Sancte Spiritus,”
the “Hymns of the Blessed Sacrament,” and those innumerable
sequences so familiar to every Christian ear, owe nothing of their
inspiration to classic sources. It is even possible that they may set
at defiance the rules of Latin prosody; but all sense of harmony
must be destroyed before we can designate the language in which
they are composed as a “hybrid jargon.” And who were the writers
of these exquisite compositions, which gave a voice to popular Christian
devotion, and still preserve, like some choice balm, not merely
the dogmas of the faith, but the very unction of a believing age?
They were, for the most part, monks, schoolmen, and friars, the very
men who stand charged with a conspiracy against literature and
common sense. St. Peter Damian, Adam of St. Victor, Pope
Innocent III., the Franciscan Jacopone, the Dominican St. Thomas,
and we may add, the gifted and unfortunate Abelard, the very type
and representative of the earlier scholastics&mdash;these are the barbarians
to whom we are indebted for that mediæval lyric poetry, much of
which has been incorporated into the office of the Church. In the
seventeenth century France grew ashamed of her ancient hymnology,
and committed the task of liturgical reform to Santeuil, the half-scholar,
half-buffoon, to the Jansenist Coffin, and the Deist De
Brienne. The hymns of Fortunatus and St. Ambrose were then
exchanged for studied imitations of Horace, from the pen of a writer
who boasted that he was ready to be hung up at a lamp-post if he
were detected in writing a single bad verse, though one of his Jesuit
critics has cruelly enumerated no fewer than a hundred and eight.
But whatever be the merit of his poetry, the Catholic sense has long
since passed its verdict on the question, and declared the unction of
the ancient lyrics to be worth the pure Latinity of a thousand such
writers as Jean Baptiste Santeuil.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span></p>

<p>Both orders of Mendicant Friars gave to the English Church
great prelates as well as great scholars; Kilwarby the Dominican and
Peckham the Franciscan, two of the grandest of our English primates,
may be taken as fair representatives of their respective orders. In
the first we see the Oxford and Paris doctor, learned in scriptural
and patristic lore, the “great clerk,” as Godwin calls him, who
“disputed excellently in divers exercises,” and who, as primate,
distinguished himself by his bold, uncompromising resistance to the
tyranny of powerful nobles, and his efforts for the advancement of
learning and the correction of public morals. After filling the see
of Canterbury for six years, “he was obliged to fly from the king’s
anger,” says Harpsfield, and, retiring to Rome, resigned the English
primacy and became Cardinal Bishop of Porto.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> His successor was
the Franciscan, John of Peckham, appointed like himself by papal
provision. How little was there of a worldly spirit in these appointments,
so loudly and captiously condemned, when a Pope could put
aside so powerful a personage as Robert Burnel, the chancellor of
the greatest king of England who had reigned since the Conquest,
in order to promote one, by birth a poor Sussex peasant, whose only
recommendations were his exquisite scholarship and his saintly life!
Peckham’s learned reputation was not indeed of an ordinary kind.
He was a doctor both of Paris and Oxford, and a pupil at the latter
university of St. Bonaventure; he had made the tour of all the
Italian universities, and in the Pope’s own palace had lectured on
sacred letters to a crowd of bishops and cardinals, who were proud
to call themselves his pupils, and who every day as he passed through
their ranks to his pulpit arose from their seats to show him reverence.
Wadding speaks of his singularly noble countenance and graceful
demeanour, and adds that, besides his other learned acquirements,
he was an excellent poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span></p>

<p>His appointment to the primacy being, strange to say, unopposed
by the Crown, he began his administration by calling a Provincial
Synod, among the acts of which is that memorable one which enjoins
every parish priest to explain to his flock the fundamentals of the
Faith, laying aside all the niceties of school distinction, and which
draws out in admirable and lucid terms what may be called an
abridgment of Christian doctrine, under the heads of the Creed, the
Ten Commandments, the Two Evangelical Precepts, the Seven
Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, and those that proceed from
them, the Seven Contrary Virtues, and the Seven Sacraments.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Moreover, we find him appointing parochial schoolmasters in holy
Orders for teaching the children of the poor.</p>

<p>Peckham not only visited his whole diocese, but travelled over the
greater part of England, informing himself of the exact state of
cathedrals, monasteries, clergy, and people, and making war on
pluralism, and every other abuse which be discovered. He also
showed himself very active in reforming the disorders that had crept
into the universities, and at his visitation, held at Oxford in 1283,
condemned a considerable number of false propositions, as well in
theology, as in grammar, philosophy, and logic. His fearless independence
of character did not shrink from presenting a remonstrance
against the tyranny of Edward I., and administering a rebuke to the
great Earl of Warren for allowing his deer and cattle to trample
down a poor man’s field of corn. The immense list of his works, as
given by Pitseus, shows that he was not of the number of those who
neglected the arts. Besides his “Concordance of the Scriptures,”
and his theological and scholastic works, there are poems, treatises
on geometry, optics, and astronomy, others on mystical divinity,
others on the pastoral office intended for the use of the parochial
clergy, and some apparently drawn up to facilitate the instruction
of the poor. Yet this illustrious man, undoubtedly one of the
greatest of our English primates, was never in private life anything
but the simple Friar Minor. “He was stately in gesture, gait, and
outward show,” says Harpsfield, “yet of an exceeding meek, facile,
and liberal temper.” At his own table sumptuously furnished for
his guests, he ate only the coarsest viands, always travelled on
foot, and chose to perform the humblest offices in his cathedral
church, such as lighting the waxen tapers on the altar. It is a
significant fact, that he always retained a prebend attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
see of Lyons, in case he might at any time be forced to fly from
England; and Godwin tells us, that after his time this benefice continued
annexed to the see of Canterbury, in order to provide
against the case of the more than probable exile of the Primates.</p>

<p>Our last specimen of an Oxford Don of the thirteenth century
shall be taken from a different class; no Worcestershire yeoman, or
Sussex peasant boy, but the son of the greatest and noblest of the
English barons, Cantilupe, Earl of Pembroke, marshal and protector
of the realm during the stormy minority of Henry III. Thomas
Cantilupe, his eldest son, was educated first at court, and then at
the universities of Oxford, Paris, and Orleans; and whether at court
or in the schools, he displayed the same piety and delicacy of conscience.
Deeply learned both in canon and civil law, he was raised
by king Henry to the post of Lord Chancellor, and was also elected
Chancellor of the University of Oxford. But on the accession of
Edward I. he obtained leave to resign his dignities, and retired to
Oxford, where he trusted he might spend the rest of his life in the
practice of study and devotion. He took his degree of Doctor of
Divinity in the church of the Dominicans, on which occasion his
old master and spiritual director, Robert Kilwarby, then Archbishop
of Canterbury, was present, and scrupled not publicly to declare
his belief that he had never forfeited his baptismal innocence. He
was then fifty-four years of age. “So help me God,” were the archbishop’s
words, “I believe him to be this day as pure from all
actual sin as on the day of his birth. And if any man ask, let him
know that from his childhood I have heard his confessions, and
read his life and conscience as clearly as a man may read an open
book.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>After attending the second Council of Lyons, he was elected
Bishop of Hereford, and in the government of his diocese found
himself, singularly enough, opposed to his saintly metropolitan, John
of Peckham, who, as he conceived, overstrained his authority as
Primate. Yet though he staunchly defended the rights of his Church,
and was constantly engaged in vexatious disputes with some of the
great barons, no one ever dreamt of charging him with a haughty or
ambitious spirit. The speciality of his sanctity was charity, and it
was said of him that he was never seen angry, save when a whisper
of detraction met his ear.</p>

<p>Such were some of the Oxford doctors and chancellors of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
period, and such the prelates chosen from their ranks. Not indeed
that we would be thought desirous of representing our ancient
universities as exclusively schools of saints; the slightest acquaintance
with the academic annals suffices to show that they were disgraced
by many scandals, and were too often the scenes of lawless outrages
and contentions, which, in our days of higher civilisation, must
naturally excite both wonder and disgust. Moreover, the halls of
Oxford were haunted by a spirit very different from that which pervaded
the cloisters of Jarrow. The world had entered there, with
all its false maxims, and scholars were not ashamed to squabble for
benefices, and often, on the motive of self-interest, to take part with
the Crown against the Church. Still, when all has been said that
impartial candour demands, we cannot doubt that many precious
traditions must have been preserved in the university schools, and
that they moulded many a poor scholar in the old saintly and
beautiful type. Moreover, we are approaching the time when the
most flagrant evils of the universities were about to receive a partial
remedy by the establishment of the collegiate system, which soon
became tacitly accepted as <em>the</em> educational system of England. It
aimed, and to a great degree successfully, at combining the discipline
of the old monastic schools with the larger intellectual advantages of
the universities. The reputed priority is ordinarily assigned to
University College, which, on the ground of its supposed foundation
by Alfred, claims to be the first in point of antiquity of the Oxford
foundations. But its real existence as a college dates only from the
time of William, Archdeacon of Durham, by whose will a sum of
money was assigned for the maintenance of a body of masters, who,
in 1280, were required to live together in one house, and receive a
body of statutes. But Merton College had already received its royal
charter in 1264, and one year previously to that date, John Baliol,
father to the unfortunate Scottish King, had taken some steps towards
the foundation of the college which bears his name. His intentions
were carried into effect by his widow, the Lady Devorgilla, who, at
the instigation of her Franciscan confessor, Richard Stickbury,
founded the college in honour of the Holy Trinity, Our Lady, and
St. Catherine the Martyr. It would be pleasant to present to the
reader the heiress of the ancient princes of Galloway, as she appears
in semi-monastic costume, in her Oxford portrait, or to reproduce
those exquisitely engrossed statutes, which provide that the students
of Baliol shall be present at the divine offices on Sundays and holidays,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
and shall on other days frequent the schools; that they shall
always speak Latin in common, and if they neglect to do so, shall be
served last at table; that a sophism shall be disputed among them
once a week, and that they be allowed a penny a day for their
sustenance, and two pence on Sundays! But as our object is only
to notice those collegiate foundations which in a marked way influenced
the system of education, we shall pass on to Merton, avowedly
the first English college incorporated by charter, and the model on
which most of the subsequent foundations, both of Oxford and
Cambridge were raised. Its founder, Walter de Merton, Bishop of
Rochester and Chancellor of the realm, may be, in fact regarded as
the originator of the collegiate system, and is designated in his
monumental inscription <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unius exemplo, omnium quotquot extant collegiorum
Fundator, maximorumque Europæ totius ingeniorum felicissimus
parens</i>. The immense evils of the university system, which was
practically no system at all, early attracted his attention, and determined
him on making the experiment of gathering a certain number
of scholars from the halls and hostels where they now congregated
subject to a merely nominal discipline, and placing them under the
control of masters and tutors in a spacious building under semi-monastic
rules. What was designed with so much sagacity was
executed with corresponding magnificence, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus Scholarium
de Merton</i> became the curiosity of its age. Architectural splendour
was not at first considered any necessary part of a collegiate foundation,
but the various tenements purchased by Bishop Merton were
reduced to a regular quadrangular form, and a college chapel was
included in the original design, two chaplains being appointed for
“the ministration of Divine service.” In 1265, the parish church of
St. John Baptist was made over to the founder by the monks of Reading,
and granted to the perpetual use of the scholars. Their studies
appear to have differed in no way from those of the other Oxonians,
but Wood considers the appointment of a grammar-master to indicate
that Bishop Merton designed to put some check on the decay of arts.</p>

<p>Among the early benefactresses to this college was one who might
almost be called its co-foundress, Ella Longspée, Countess of
Warwick, and daughter to that other Ella, Countess of Salisbury,
who had obtained the conversion of her ferocious husband, Longspée,
through the instrumentality of St. Edmund.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The friendship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>
of the elder Ella with the saintly archbishop appears to have inspired
both her daughters with a singular goodwill towards Oxford, and
Ella in particular made large donations of lands and endowments
to the Merton scholars. Such was the success of the new foundation
that the king himself recommended it to Hugh de Balsham, Bishop
of Ely, as a model for his proposed Cambridge College of Peterhouse;
and the example once set, was soon taken up by others. The
Benedictines had possessed houses of studies in Oxford from a very
early period, but the proposal was now made to found a regular
college, intended, in the first instance, exclusively for students from
Gloucester Abbey, but the benefits of which were afterwards extended
to those of St. Alban’s, Glastonbury, Tavistock, Chertsey, Coventry,
Evesham, St. Edmundsbury, Winchcombe, and Malmsbury, all of
which contributed to the expense of rearing the necessary buildings.
The real founder of Gloucester College, however, was not an abbot,
but a baron, John Giffard, Lord of Brimesfield, and husband of
Maud Longspée, whose persuasions doubtless had great share in
promoting his munificence. In 1291, a general chapter was held
at Abingdon of the monks of the province of Canterbury, and a tax
imposed on all the Benedictine houses of the province, to raise the
necessary funds.</p>

<p>The result was the erection of a grand and commodious pile
of buildings, some of which remain to this day, and form a part of
the modern Worcester College. The apartments occupied by the
students of the different religious houses were separate one from
another, and distinguished by their arms or rebusses. Thus, we see
the cross-keys for St. Peter’s of Gloucester, a comb and a ton, with
the letter W, for Winchcombe, and so of the rest. Each abbey sent
a certain number of students at a time, who were governed by a prior,
elected by themselves, called the “Prior Studentium,” and who had
a rule adapted to suit their peculiar requirements. They were
enjoined not to mix familiarly with the secular students, to have
divinity disputations once a week, and to practise preaching, both in
Latin and English. A chair of theology was afterwards founded for
their special instruction. In short, Gloucester College was a true
religious seminary, and continued to enjoy a high character for learning
down to the time of the general suppression of religious houses.
Wood gives many interesting particulars of the college, and the good
scholars whom it produced. Whethamstede, abbot of St. Alban’s in
the reign of Henry VI., of whom we shall have hereafter to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
more at length, was at one time the “Prior Studentium,” and afterwards
bestowed such large benefactions on the house as to be called
its second founder. He put in the five painted windows of the
chapel, built a vestiary and a library, and presented many books.
Moreover, he adorned the images of the Crucifix and the Saints with
“deprecatory rhymes.” His dear and learned friend, Humphrey of
Gloucester, likewise enriched the library with several valuable manuscripts.
The first Benedictine of this college who took his doctor’s
degree was William Brok, who graduated in divinity in 1298. The
inception of a university doctor was in those days a stately ceremony,
and on this occasion the Benedictines thought it well to celebrate
the auspicious event with more than ordinary splendour. Six abbots
of the order, therefore, attended the customary procession on horseback,
besides “monks, priors, obedientiaries, and claustral clerks, a
hundred noblemen and esquires,” and most of the Benedictine
bishops of the province of Canterbury. The Durham monks were
not long before they provided themselves with a similar seminary,
and in 1286 obtained lands for the erection of their college from
Dame Mabel Wafte, abbess of Godstow. The endowments of this
establishment were intended half for lay and half for religious
students. They also had their “Prior Studentium,” and the good
repute of their learning induced Richard of Bury, the celebrated
Bishop of Durham, to leave them his magnificent library of books.
The site of this foundation is now occupied by the more modern
Trinity College.</p>

<p>These religious establishments, it is not to be doubted, had a considerable
share in promoting the extension of the collegiate system
now fairly introduced into Oxford. The Merton scholars soon
attracted notice; of whom the most famous was Duns Scotus, who
after leaving the university entered among the Franciscan friars of
Newcastle, and returning to Oxford to study a second time under
the doctors of his own order, won perhaps the highest renown which
attaches to the name of any English divine since the days of Bede.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
The reign of Edward II. witnessed the foundation of two more
colleges. Oriel claims as its founder that unfortunate monarch himself,
who, whatever may have been his faults, was an undoubted
patron of letters. It is probable, however, that he had little more
than a nominal share in the foundation, which was the real work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
his almoner, Adam de Brom. Exeter owes its name to its founder,
Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, and both these were, more or
less, in their statutes and general spirit, copies of Merton. The effects
of the changes thus introduced into the university system are
differently estimated by different writers. By many the diminution
in the number of students which became apparent in the fourteenth
century, is attributed to the increase of colleges. These of course
could only accommodate a limited number, whereas any amount of
students might swarm in the hostels and lodging-houses which were
formerly their only resort. However, if the old adage, that quality
is to be preferred to quantity, is to be held of any force, this can
hardly be said to be a disadvantage. Six thousand students living
under regular discipline were perhaps better than thirty thousand,
containing a large proportion of “varlets;” and although in our days
the collegiate system may be regarded as having a tendency to aristocratical
exclusiveness, this was far from being its intention or result
in the early period of its institution. The endowments were for poor
scholars, and by poor scholars they were mostly enjoyed. It
appears probable also that the successive pestilences which desolated
Oxford in the reign of Edward III., and the troubles occasioned by
Wickliffe and his followers, had a great deal to do with the decrease of
the scholars. Besides which, it must be borne in mind that the rage
for scholastic learning which characterised the thirteenth century,
gave place in England during the fourteenth to a rage for French
conquests. So completely did the brilliant successes achieved by
the two Edwards root this passion in the English mind, that the
cultivation of letters was little regarded, and perhaps after Wickliffe’s
time it was looked on by some with a not unnatural suspicion.
Many of the colleges had become tainted with Lollardism, and
remained under a cloud; the tide of popular favour had set in for
the showy chivalry of the day, and clerks and scholars went somewhat
out of fashion. The close tie which had hitherto knit together
the schools of Oxford and Paris was henceforth totally sundered, nor
is it easy to estimate the injury thus accruing to the English university,
which in the thirteenth century enjoyed the freest intercommunion
with the French and Italian academies. The narrow insular spirit
which thus sprang up, and which was nourished by the anti-Roman
tendencies of English legislation, was fatal to intellectual progress.
Hence the learned renown of our universities certainly declined, but
so far was this from being the result of the collegiate system that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
is evident the noble foundations of Wykeham, Waynflete, Fleming,
Chicheley, and Henry VI., were undertaken with the view of
supplying a remedy to the existing evils, and as a means of effecting
a revival of learning among the English clergy.</p>

<p>The history of these foundations belongs however to a later date.
For the present we must leave our semibarbarous island (for so, under
favour, must baronial England doubtless have been regarded by
dwellers south of the Alps), and see what kind of scholarship was
flourishing in the more classic atmosphere of Italy at the very time
when the first stones were being laid of our ancient Oxford cloisters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> what has hitherto been said of the universities, which in the
thirteenth century had fairly established themselves as the great
organs of education, it has not been possible to convey any just or
satisfactory notion of the exact nature of those studies fostered within
their schools. The reader will perhaps have gathered a general idea
that a great change had been gradually effected since the days of
St. Anselm; that humane letters were becoming neglected, and that
scholastic philosophy and canon law had even threatened at one time
to discourage the cultivation of Scriptural and patristic studies; that
theology, on the other hand, had become digested into a scientific
system by the great scholastic doctors, who had reinstated the study
of the Scriptures and the Biblical tongues, but who had not done
much to restore polite letters; and finally, that the physical sciences
had made a certain sensible advance. This general statement has
in it a fair amount of truth; nevertheless, general statements are such
unsatisfactory things, that the desire rises to one’s mind that some
scholar of our old universities could be put on his examination before
a Royal Commission, and tell us with his own lips what he did, and
what he did not, learn from his mediæval teachers. The wish is not
so extravagant as it might appear. Fortunately for our purpose, one
scholar existed who gathered in himself the learning of Padua,
Bologna, Paris, and Oxford Universities, for he studied successively
at them all, and has left the result in writings, which for six centuries
have been submitted to close critical examination, and are still in
our hands. A glance through their pages promises, therefore, to give
us some information on the point in question.</p>

<p>It was probably some time in the reign of Edward I., that among
the 30,000 students who crowded the inns and hostels of old Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
there appeared an Italian of middle age, of whose previous career at
other universities we know no more, than that at Padua and Bologna
he had addicted himself to moral and natural philosophy; that at
Paris he was held to be a first-rate theologian; and that returning
thither a second time, after political troubles had driven him into
exile, he had held a disputation against fourteen opponents, had
taken his bachelor’s degree, and was only prevented by an empty
purse from graduating as master; and finally, that both at Paris and
elsewhere he had evinced a marked predilection for the mystical
interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. These are all the traces that
he has left behind him in the schools, and yet how well we know
him! The countenances of Shakespeare or Byron, or Sir Walter
Scott, are not more familiar to us than the grand and melancholy
features of Dante Alighieri, whom we claim as an Oxford student,
on the authority of John de Serraville, Bishop of Fermo, a writer who,
as he lived only a century later than the poet, may be supposed to
have derived his information from contemporary sources.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Plain in
dress, temperate in his habits, polished and dignified in his manners,
which were, however, dashed with more than a touch of sarcasm,&mdash;a
man of few words, given to long fits of abstraction, his form a little
stooping, his sight early impaired by excessive application to his
books; something of an artist, and such a lover of music that, as he
tells us, it had power to soothe him even in the worst of times, an
exquisite caligrapher, as they attest who have seen his writing, and
describe it as <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">magra e lunga, e molto corretta</i>, a close and curious
observer of nature, and above all, of the phenomena of the starry
heavens, a perfect scholar, yet, withal, a soldier too, well skilled in
all the martial exercises that became his rank&mdash;such was he whom
we have ventured to select as the representative man of the Catholic
universities as they existed before that new era of taste and literature
which was ushered in by his countryman Petrarch.</p>

<p>Dante is acknowledged by all critics to have been the most learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
of the poets, not excepting Milton, the character of whose genius so
closely resembles his own. His learning was characteristic of his age:
the extraordinary prominence given in his poem to the scholastic
theology and philosophy tells us at once in what century it was
composed. Aristotle, Christianised and interpreted by St. Thomas,
is the master whom he follows;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> yet perhaps he is not quite so
exclusive an Aristotelian as most scholastics of his time, for it is
evident that he had studied Plato with almost equal attention,
specially the Timæus of that philosopher, to which he frequently
refers. He, however, invariably gives the preference to Aristotle,
whom he calls, “the master among the wise;” whereas Petrarch
assigns the first place to Plato. But “Dante the Theologian,” as he
is called in his epitaph, had other masters besides the Greeks. He
who had won his bachelor’s degree in fair fight against fourteen
opponents, a reminiscence to which he refers in his poem, had to be
furnished with arms from the scholastic arsenal. Accordingly, when
he describes himself as undergoing the questioning of the Apostles
on the subject of Faith, Hope, and Charity, he gives his answers in
the language of the Master of the Sentences, as well as of St. Denys
the Areopagite, and St. Augustine. His diction is thickly sown with
the phraseology of the schools, with “quiddities,” “syllogisms,”
“propositions,” “demonstrations,” and the like; yet when he comes
to make his profession of faith, how sublimely does he rise above
these technicalities, and declare that his belief rests neither on physical
nor metaphysical proof, but on the testimony of the Holy Ghost, on
Moses, the Prophets, the Psalms, and the Gospels.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Elsewhere he
appeals to the teaching of St. Jerome, St. Isidore, St. Gregory, St.
Bernard, and most of the other Latin Fathers, and names with
loving reverence not a few of those monastics and schoolmen with
whom we have made acquaintance in the foregoing pages, such
as Bede and Rabanus, St. Peter Damian, Peter Comestor, Hugh and
Richard of St. Victor, and Albert the Great. But above all these
appear St. Thomas and St. Buonaventura, the former of whom is,
beyond all doubt, the guide of Dante in philosophy and theology,
and whom he introduces in the thirteenth canto of the Paradiso,
speaking in his own person, and using the scientific phraseology of
the schools.</p>

<p>The political opinions set forth by Dante are no less characteristic
of the mediæval university student than his theological views.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
Born of a family attached to a party of the Guelphs, he himself kept
aloof for some time from either faction, and, as Chief Prior of
Florence, aimed at holding an even balance between them. This
line of conduct gave little satisfaction to the Neri, as the Florentine
Guelphs were called; and they accused him, as it would seem not
without cause, of concealing, under the show of impartiality, a secret
leaning towards the Ghibellines. On occasion of a popular insurrection,
the Priors agreed to banish the leaders of both parties; on this
the Guelphs leagued to call in the assistance of Charles of Valois,
Captain-General to Pope Boniface VIII. This appeal to the
protection of the hated lilies of France moved Dante to an act of
severity which proved his own ruin. The banished chiefs of the
Bianchi were recalled, while those of the Neri remained in exile.
Driven to extremity, the Guelphs despatched an envoy to Rome,
entreating the Pope to put the pacification of Florence into the hands
of Charles of Valois. Dante hastened to Rome to oppose this
demand, but in his absence another popular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeute</i> broke out, the
Neri triumphed, their exiles were recalled, and in their turn decreed
banishment and loss of goods against their enemies. The original
document is still preserved, in which, to the sentence of confiscation
is added that of <em>burning alive</em>, decreed against Dante and fourteen
other citizens, should they ever again set foot in Florence.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>It must be admitted that if the writings of Dante exhibit after this
time all the bitterness of “Ghibelline bile,” there was some excuse to
be made for him. Almost against his own will he had been thrown
from his position of theoretic impartiality into the arms of the
Ghibelline faction. Not that he ever entirely embraced their cause;
he had good sense enough to admit that truth is seldom to be found
in the ranks of party, and owned in after years that it was hard to say
whether Guelph or Ghibelline were most to be blamed for the evils
which their animosities had brought upon Italy.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> He felt for the
sufferings of his country scarcely less than for his own; and the only
remedy which he saw for the miseries resulting from the rage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
factions was the establishment of a firm monarchical government,
such as was presented in the theory of the Holy Roman Empire.
This fancy he dwelt on and idealised till he came to believe that
Empire a thing of divine institution, applying to it the words of the
Apostle, “There is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.” The
extravagances into which he suffered himself to be led on this subject
are not entirely to be referred to the influence of his university
studies, yet it is certain that the principles current in all the great
academies offered nothing to correct the absolutism of his political
creed. Bologna had received her “Habita” from the Emperor
Frederic II., in reward for the good services which her lawyers had
rendered him in supporting his claims against the Italian Communi.
Paris was on the very eve of supporting the sacrilegious enormities of
Philip le Bel. At Oxford, the greatest law school north of the Alps, the
imperial jurisprudence formed the favourite study; and though, with
that happy <em>inconsequence</em> which is the national characteristic, the
English would none of it for practical purposes, yet they learnt
enough from their law studies to induce them to support a course
of legislation, the ultimate result of which was the establishment of
a royal supremacy.</p>

<p>In all these academies the supremacy of the temporal power was,
in one form or other, the favourite political dogma, and the tendency
of their teaching was, perhaps, more directly anti-Papal than that of
the Italian poet, for Dante’s Ghibellinism, bitter and resentful as it
was, never clouded the instincts of his faith. He regarded Boniface
VIII. as his personal enemy, and attributed to his intervention the
revolution that had driven him into exile. With the terrible anger
of his silent nature which suppressed every outward demonstration
of passion, he pursued and made war upon him with his pen; yet
the hatred he felt for the man never blinded him as to the character
of his office. When he comes to speak of the outrages committed
against him at the instigation of Philip le Bel, he forgets that it is
his enemy who is being thus dealt with, and gives expression to the
deep religious sense of a child of Holy Church in lines for ever
memorable. He beholds Christ once more mocked and derided in
the person of His Vicar, he sees the gall and vinegar renewed, execrates
the cruelty of the new Pilate and the new thieves, and weeps
over the sufferings of the Church, whose woes are now, he says, the
theme of every prayer.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Indeed, in all save his politics, Dante reflects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span>
the spirit of the ages of faith. The grim grotesqueness which mingles
with his most terrible pictures breathes the identical character to be
found in the illuminations and sculptures of the same period, evincing
an intense sense of certain grave realities which the mediæval
artists never shrank from picturing to the mind and eye. The liturgical
spirit, too, is there, reminding us almost at every page that we
are reading the words of one who lived when the office of the Church
was still the Prayer Book of the faithful, and when university
students, like St. Edmund, or Jordan of Saxony, were accustomed to
rise at midnight and attend the singing of Matins in their parish
church.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Some of the most exquisite passages of his poem owe their
beauty to the skill with which he has woven into his verse passages
and phrases from the Psalms, the Breviary Hymns, and other devotions
of the Church. Yet Dante was very far from being exclusively
a theologian and a scholastic. His writings offer sufficient evidence
that the scholars of the thirteenth century were familiar with other
Latin than that of Duns Scotus. He had closely studied all the
Latin poets, and sometimes translates or paraphrases entire lines from
Virgil. His mind was so steeped in the history and mythology of
the ancients, that many of his pages, if translated, might be taken
for quotations from Milton; for like him he possessed the art of
stringing together a series of classic names and allusions, the melody
of which makes us willing to pardon their pedantry. One example
may suffice, which shall be given in its English dress, the better to
convey the resemblance which it bears to kindred Miltonic passages.
It is the poet Virgil who is speaking to Statius, and describing the
state of the good heathen in limbo:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span></p>
<p>Every one of the names here named are Greek, and it is clear that
Dante was well acquainted with the stories of the Greek poets; but
was he also acquainted with their language? This is a question
fiercely debated by his commentators, and considered to be still an
unresolved problem. In his prose work, the “Convito,” he has
criticised an erroneous translation from Aristotle, and in one of the
finest passages of the “Purgatorio” introduces a Greek word, which
alone has furnished matter for a voluminous controversy.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> These
and other passages have led many to give him credit for being
possessed of Greek scholarship. The point is not decided, but the
probability appears to be that his knowledge of the language was at
any rate not very profound. In the same way he may be said to
have been not totally unacquainted with Hebrew and Arabic, for
several explanations of Hebrew words occur in his works, and the
mysterious words which he places with so tremendous and dramatic
an effect in the mouth of Nimrod,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> are declared by one critic to be
Arabic, and by another to be Syriac; but are more probably, as
Bianchi observes, a jumble of sounds chosen from the Oriental
dialects, and intended to convey a notion of the confusion of tongues,
and to startle the ear with their uncouth cabalistic sound. Without
claiming for our poet the merit of Hebrew and Oriental learning,
we may at least gather from such passages that he had studied
in schools where these tongues were not entirely unknown, where the
decree of Clement V. was probably carried out, and professors were
to be found who could furnish him with enough of Eastern erudition
to serve his purpose. On other points his acquirements were, however,
far less superficial. The trivium and quadrivium in all their
branches are easy enough to be traced through his writings. He is
known to have been a proficient in music. He refers to the quadrature
of the circle and other problems of geometry, but astronomy
was evidently his science of predilection, and occupies a very
considerable place in his poem. He wrote at a time when the
Pythagorean system was the only accepted theory, and his scientific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span>
allusions can of course only be explained according to its supposed
laws. But he did not draw all his ideas from the books
of the ancients. In his “Convito,” after giving the various explanations
of the Milky-way furnished by Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and
others, some of them sufficiently absurd, he decides in favour of
the opinion that there is a multitude of fixed stars in that part of the
heavens, so small (or, as we should now say, so distant), that we
cannot separately distinguish them, but which cause the appearance
of whiteness. The other views, he observes, seem devoid of reason.
The astronomer, Ideler, was the first to point out that Dante’s
description in the opening canto of the “Purgatorio” of the four
stars,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> which he makes symbolic of the four cardinal virtues, betrays
a knowledge of the constellation of the Southern Cross, of which he
may have heard from the Genoese and Pisan mariners who had
visited Cape Comorin, and which he may even have seen depicted
on that curious globe constructed by the Arabs in 1225, where it
was distinctly marked. He had attentively studied geography, and
notices many such points as find a place in our manuals of the globes,
such as the intersection of the great circles, as they are exhibited
on the armillary sphere; and reminds us that within the torrid zone
at certain seasons no shadows fall, on account of the sun being then
directly overhead.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Tiraboschi gives him credit for anticipating a
supposed discovery of Galileo’s, that wine is nothing but the heat of
the sun mingled with the juice of the grape; and Maffei comments
on the “marvellous felicity” with which he expresses his scientific
ideas. The theory of the attraction of gravitation<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> is stated as
distinctly in his pages as in those of Vincent de Beauvais; and his
allusions to the nature of plants and the habits of animals, and
particularly of birds, seem to evince, not merely a familiarity with
the works of Albert the Great, but the observant eye of a real
naturalist.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> His artistic feeling appears in a thousand passages,
which were afterwards given a visible shape by Orcagna, and so
many other painters of the early Florentine school; as well as in
some wonderful landscape-painting in words, which, as Humboldt
says, “manifest profound sensibility to the aspect of external nature.”
Such is his description, imitated by so many later Italian poets, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
the birds beginning their morning songs in the pine forest of Chiassi,
of the dawning light trembling on the distant sea, of the goatherd
watching his flocks among the hills, and of the flowery meadow illuminated
by a sudden ray of sunlight darting through the broken
clouds.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> He never directly alludes to those grand creations of
Christian art, the cathedrals, most of which were coeval in their
rise with the European universities. Yet he continually reminds us
that he lived when religious artists were carving the sacred sculptures
on their walls, or filling their windows with a mystic splendour, and
that he had felt the power of those vaulted aisles, which he had,
perhaps, visited as a pilgrim.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Enough has been said to indicate the nature of Dante’s learning,
which was undoubtedly the learning of his time. It differed from
that of his contemporaries in degree, but not in kind. When Mr.
Berington gives expression to his delight at having at last found a
man who could admire Virgil, he shows not only a very imperfect
appreciation of the acquirements of mediæval scholars, but even of
the poet whom he condescends to praise. Dante’s aim was avowedly
to write a <em>popular</em> poem; he desired to be read, not merely by the
learned, but by the mass of his countrymen; and it was with this
object that he sacrificed his first intention of writing in Latin verse,
and chose the rude Italian vernacular, not without a certain regret,
but with the design of being more widely intelligible, for, to use his
own words, “we must not give meat to sucklings.” We may safely
dare to affirm that had not the Latin classics been freely admitted into
the Christian schools of the thirteenth century, Dante would never
have ventured to have chosen Virgil as his representative of Moral
Philosophy. And if the world to which he addressed himself had not
known something&mdash;perhaps a good deal&mdash;of classical history and
poetry, his poem could not have achieved the popularity at which he
successfully aimed. But it is probable that on this point things were
not greatly changed from what they had been in the days of his
ancestor Cacciaguida, when, as he tells us, the ladies of Florence, as
they sat with their maidens,</p>

<p class="noindent">Certain it is that the erudition of the “Divina Commedia” proved
no obstacle to its popularity. There is nothing in the history of
literature that can be at all compared with the instantaneous conquest
which it achieved over the Italian public. Within thirty years of the
poet’s death an Archbishop of Milan appointed a carefully-chosen
commission of learned men to write a commentary on the poem;
Florence, which had cast him out of her walls when living, now
founded a public lecture to explain his works; and in 1373, called
on Bocaccio to deliver this lecture in the Church of St. Stefano, at
the annual salary of a hundred florins.</p>

<p>We are not, however, concerned with the literary history of Dante,
who is only here spoken of as the representative scholar of his times.
His profound learning has never been disputed; yet it is worthy of
remark that if it be good criticism to measure a man’s scholarship
solely by the style of his Latin compositions, we should have to
number the author of the “Divina Commedia” among the other
writers whose “incredible ignorance” disgraced their age. His
prose treatises, <cite>De Monarchia</cite> and <cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite>, in substance
learned and full of acute observation, are declared to be rude and
unclassical in style; a fact which suggests doubts how far this
standard of criticism is a just one. It was fortunate indeed that he
abandoned his first purpose of writing his poem in the Latin tongue,
and chose rather that vernacular idiom which he raised to the dignity
of a language. How he dealt with it is the real marvel; he built up
his verse, much as the Athenians constructed their walls in the days
of Themistocles, laying hold of any material that came in his way,
quarrying words and phrases out of the Latin at his pleasure, filling
up chinks and vacancies with verbs and adjectives which, whatever
may have been their plebeian origin, became ennobled by his use;
and creating many a good strong word of mighty meaning which it
would have been well if his countrymen could have persuaded
themselves to retain. After his time the formation of the Italian
language rapidly developed, and the majestic mass which had been
hewn into shape by Dante, received a finer and softer polish from
Bocaccio and Petrarch.</p>

<p>Of the latter poet we now have to speak; for any sketch of mediæval
scholarship would be imperfect without some notice of him who is
commonly regarded as the restorer of polite letters. The father of
Petrarch had been banished from Florence at the same time with
Dante; and when a child, he himself had once beheld the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span>
poet, whose fame he was in some respects destined to surpass. When
he was nine years old his parents removed to Avignon in France,
where the establishment of the papal court drew many Italians.
There for four years he learnt as much grammar, logic, and rhetoric
as the schools of Avignon and Carpentras could teach, and that does
not appear to have been much. However, even at this age his
classic tastes betrayed themselves. Whilst his comrades were still
reading Æsop’s fables and the verses of Prosper, he studied the
works of Cicero, which delighted his ear long before he understood
their sense. Then came another four years at Montpelier, after
which he went to Bologna, and there studied civil law for three years
more. But as soon as he found himself removed from his father’s
watchful eye the study of jurisprudence somewhat languished. “It
was thus,” he says, “that I spent, or rather wasted, seven years; and
if I must say the truth, disgusted with my legal studies, I spent
my time mostly in reading Cicero, Virgil, and the other poets. My
father learnt this, and one day he unexpectedly appeared before me.
Guessing at once the object of his coming, I hastily hid the great
Latins, but he drew them from their hiding-place, and threw them
into the fire, as if they had been books of heresy. At this sight I
cried out as though I myself had been burnt. My father, seeing my
affliction, drew out two volumes half-scorched with the flames, and
holding one in his left and the other in his right hand, he said,
“Here, this is Virgil, take it, and it will comfort your soul a little&mdash;and
here is Cicero, you may have him too, for he will teach you how
to plead.” Somewhat consoled by this, I ceased my lamentations.”</p>

<p>But a lawyer Petrarch was determined never to become. In 1327,
having lost both his parents, he returned to Avignon, put on the
ecclesiastical dress, and received the tonsure; but he had no more
serious intention of following the clerical than the legal profession.
He cared only for a life of literary ease, and the “graceful indolence”
which has been declared to form one of the charms of his verses,
was the predominant feature in his character. It was at this time
that he formed that attachment to Laura de Sade which inspired the
400 sonnets, and other “Rime,” which have made the celebrity of
their author. At once to soothe his grief and to satisfy his curiosity,
he undertook a voyage through France and Germany. He visited
Paris, and describes its University as “a basket filled with the rarest
fruits of every land.” The French, he says, are “gay of humour,
fond of society, and pleasant in conversation; they make war on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span>
care by diversion, singing, laughing, eating, and drinking.” He
visited Toulouse, and was introduced to the famous academy of the
<em>Gaie Science</em>, established in 1324, of which Laura de Sade was herself
a member. Seven poets, with a chancellor at their head, held their
meetings in a palace surrounded by beautiful gardens, and solemnly
granted the degrees of bachelor or doctor to the candidates for
Parnassian honours, the prize for the best poem produced at the
floral games of the month of May being a golden violet. At last he
returned to Avignon, and, retiring to a country house in the solitude
of Vaucluse, composed, amid its woods and fountains, some of his
sweetest Italian sonnets, some Latin prose treatises, and his heroic
Latin poem of “Africa,” on which he bestowed immense labour.
Great, indeed, would have been his own surprise could he have
foreseen that posterity would have cared nothing at all for the
classical imitations which procured him his laurel crown from the
hands of the Roman Senate, and that his immortality as a poet
would rest on those careless rhymes which he calls the unpremeditated
songs of his juvenile sorrows, and which, being written in the
despised vernacular tongue, he counted as of little merit. It was as
a Latin writer that he desired to be remembered, and it was the fame
of his “Africa” that induced the Senate of Rome and the University
of Paris to offer him their honours on the same day. Petrarch’s
classic predilections, and his intense love of his native country,
determined him to give the preference to Rome; and after a three
days’ examination, which was presided over by the learned King
Robert of Naples, he was crowned on the Capitol, on Easter-day,
1341, and hung up his laurel wreath in the Basilica of the Apostles.</p>

<p>The rest of his life was chiefly spent in Italy, where the reigning
princes of the Visconti, the Este, the Scaligeri, and the Gonzaga
vied one with another in doing him honour. He devoted himself
with a sort of passionate eagerness to the enterprise of seeking out
copies of the neglected classics, and his correspondents in all parts
of Europe assisted him in his labours. Cicero was his literary idol,
and when the strangers who crowded round him asked him what
presents they could send him from their distant lands, his reply was
ever, “Nothing but the works of Cicero.” He rescued from oblivion
some of the epistles of his favourite author, and was once possessed
of a copy of his treatise <cite>De Gloria</cite>, now lost to the world. He had
almost an equal zeal in collecting and preserving medals and ancient
monuments of art, and severely reprehended the practice, so common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span>
among the Romans, of destroying the venerable remains of antiquity,
in order to procure building materials at an easy rate. Though
never able to master the Greek language, he had the consolation of
witnessing the first steps which ushered in the revival of that study.
In 1339, Barlaam, a Calabrian monk who had for many years been
a resident in Greece, was despatched to Avignon on a mission to
Pope Benedict XII., from the Emperor Cantacuzenus. Petrarch
took some lessons in Greek from him, but had too little perseverance
to profit much from his master’s lessons. Barlaam is declared by
Bocaccio to have been a treasury of every kind of learning, and
superior to any other scholar of the time. He wrote on theology,
astronomy, and mathematics, and was well acquainted with the
ancient Greek poetry. And so, after all, the Greek literature was
restored to Europe through the instrumentality of a <em>monk</em>! For it
was one of Barlaam’s disciples, by name Leontius Pilate, also a
Calabrian, who afterwards visited Petrarch at Venice, and from
whom Bocaccio acquired a knowledge of Greek. The latter scholar
persuaded the Florentine magistrates to appoint Leontius Greek
professor in their city, and in 1361 the first Greek chair was erected
in the West, and curious crowds flocked to listen to lectures on the
“Iliad” and the “Odyssey,” delivered from the lips of one whose
outward appearance was that of an uncouth savage. He wore the
philosopher’s, or rather the beggar’s, mantle, his countenance was
hideous, his beard long and uncombed, his manners rude, and his
temper gloomy. He remained at Florence three years, and then
returned to the East to search for manuscripts; but such was his overbearing
insolence that, in spite of his treasures of classic erudition,
Petrarch would have nothing to say to him when he proposed a
second visit to Italy. Leontius, however, embarked on board a
vessel with the intention of returning to Florence, but was overtaken
by a tempest, and struck dead by lightning. Petrarch was concerned
at his loss, and yet more so by the fear that his books had perished
with him. “Inquire, I beseech you,” he wrote to Bocaccio,
“whether there were not a Euripides or a Sophocles among them,
or some other of the books he promised to bring me.” He had
already procured from Nicholas Sigeros a Greek Homer, which he
prized, though unable to read it. “Your Homer,” he writes, “is
dumb to me, and I am deaf to it; nevertheless, the sight of it consoles
me, and I often kiss its cover. I beg of you send me Hesiod,
send me Euripides.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521"></a>[521]</span></p>

<p>It was not only by the Italian dukes and princes that Petrarch
was cherished; the Popes&mdash;Benedict XII., Clement VI., and Urban
V.&mdash;all testified their sense of his merit, and enriched him with many
benefices, and Urban is said to have been somewhat influenced in
his determination to revisit Rome by the arguments of the poet.
For whilst Petrarch allowed his pen the most unwarrantable freedoms
in censuring the conduct of the papal court, he had nothing more at
heart than the restoration of the Popes to their ancient capital, and
on this point he shared the sentiments of Dante. Neither were the
middle and lower classes at all behind their betters in the enthusiasm
with which they regarded the great scholar. A certain grammar-master
who had grown half-blind and wholly crippled, hearing that
Petrarch was at Naples, determined to go thither to see him, and
made his son carry him there on his shoulders. By the time they
arrived the poet had departed for Rome. However, the old man
declared himself ready to journey to the Indies if he could only
come up with the object of his search, so they took the road to
Rome; again too late, they proceeded to Parma, and there, to the
inexpressible consolation of the venerable grammarian, he saw “his
Petrarch,” and causing his son to lift him up, he reverently kissed
the head that had conceived so many noble thoughts, and the hand
that had written so much good Latin.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> In one of his familiar
epistles, Petrarch relates the story of a certain goldsmith of Bergamo
who, having exchanged the pursuits of trade for those of literature,
was possessed with such a passing great admiration of the author of
the “Rime,” that he declared he should not die content unless he
were once suffered to receive him in his house. Petrarch gave him
that satisfaction but the delight of the goldsmith was so excessive,
that his servants feared he would go mad with joy, and his guest had
some difficulty in freeing himself from his troublesome attendance.
Petrarch affected to treat these demonstrations of popular homage
with studied contempt, but whilst he talked and wrote of the charms
of solitude, it was evident that he was not a little intoxicated with
the vapours of gratified vanity. Whatever pains he took to express his
indifference to the world, he lost no opportunity of letting his friends
know that the world was not indifferent to him. “Whenever I leave
my house,” he wrote from Milan, “a thing that happens very rarely,
I bow right and left, and stop to speak to no one. I am more
esteemed here than I deserve, and far more than suits my taste for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522"></a>[522]</span>
quiet. Not only do the prince and his court love and honour me,
but the people respect me far beyond my merits, and love me without
so much as seeing me, for I rarely appear in public.” His letters
are filled with passages of this kind, which sufficiently betray that
the would-be philosopher, who had written long treatises on the
Solitary Life, and on Contempt of the World, was secretly devoured
by a hungry egotism. His notions of the joys of Solitude attained
to nothing more sublime than lying under a tree with a book in one’s
hand, and no one would have been less pleased than he, if his
admirers had taken him at his word and ceased to pester him. Yet
the homage of the world had no power to soothe the restlessness
that devoured him, and in the midst of all his outward successes,
fortune failed not to deal him many a cruel blow. The great plague
of 1348, which desolated all Europe, and which was so powerfully
described by the pen of Bocaccio, carried off Laura de Sade among
its first victims, and Petrarch recorded his sorrow on the blank leaves
of his Virgil. Other losses followed, and in the midst of these private
griefs, Petrarch, who had given his confidence to the celebrated
Rienzi and had dedicated a noble sonnet to one whom he fondly
trusted would have been the restorer of his country’s greatness, felt
the fall of the great Tribune as a personal misfortune. “Some,” he
exclaimed, “can still rejoice in riches, some in intellect, and some in
health; but for me, I see not what anything in the world can
henceforth give me, save tears.” A sad avowal for the greatest
scholar of his age, but a scholar whose character, whatever may be
said of his genius, was utterly hollow and superficial. The mere
man of letters&mdash;and whatever may have been his sincere regret for
the graver irregularities of his youth,&mdash;we must add, the unworthy
ecclesiastic, ever sensible in the midst of his literary triumphs of a
want and a weariness, is a poor exchange indeed, with all his erudition,
for the race of Christian scholars with whom we have hitherto
been engaged. His last residence was fixed at Arqua, near Padua;
and there, on the 18th of July 1374, he was found dead in his
study, with his head leaning on an open book. He had been struck
by epilepsy, and so, as has been said, passed from the quiet of his
library to the quiet of the grave. He had been the first to inaugurate
a vast intellectual revolution, and the restoration of classical studies,
begun by him, was carried on in the following century by Poggio and
his contemporaries. For Italy, at least, the age of mediæval darkness,
had passed away for ever, and with it passed away also not a few of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523"></a>[523]</span>
the old Christian traditions of thought, art, and taste. The mind of
the coming generations was to be formed on pagan models, and from
this time, as Hallam remarks, it became the main, if not the exclusive,
object of an educated man, to write Latin correctly, to understand the
allusions of the best classic authors, and to learn at least the rudiments
of Greek. That the revived taste for ancient letters did eventually
bring about a certain anti-Christian reaction in art and literature
cannot be denied; and the character of many of those who became
distinguished among the leaders of the Renaissance was such as
scarcely entitled them to be numbered among “Christian Scholars.”
Yet it would be most unfair to include under any sweeping censure
all those who originated, or took part in, the classical revival, or to
suppose that the movement was exclusively favoured by an irreligious
party. The Augustinian friars and the Camaldolese monks of
Florence were among the first encouragers of the new studies; and
one of the earliest institutions of the nature of a literary academy,
was that established in the Augustinian convent of the Holy Spirit
at Florence. This convent adjoined the house where Giannozzo
Manetti, then a mere boy, resided; and he contrived to make a door
through the partition wall, by means of which he was able to enter
the convent whenever he liked, and attend the conferences on
literary subjects held among the brethren; the subjects of which
were every day posted up in some conspicuous part of the cloister.
Among the Camaldolese the same studies were introduced even
before the death of Petrarch, and the monks of St. Mary of the
Angels had among them men like Zenobio Tantino, who corresponded
with all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i> of the day in poetical epistles. So heartily
did they take part in the literary movements of their times that
Ambrose Traversari, of whom Roscoe says that he had the best
pretensions of any man of his age to the character of a polite scholar,
was exclusively given up by his superiors to learned pursuits for the
space of thirty years. Some, indeed, were to be found who dreaded
the possible effects of reviving the study of Gentile writers, and it
was scruples such as these which drew forth a graceful reply from
Coluccio Salutati, the friend of Petrarch and the learned chancellor
of Florence, whose achievements as a Latin poet won him the laurel
wreath which was placed, not on his brow, but on his coffin, and
whose unblemished life secured him a yet nobler reward in the friendship
of St. Antoninus of Florence. He justly protested against the
narrowness of supposing that a man could not be walking in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a>[524]</span>
ways of God because he read the poets, and argued that in literature,
as in all besides, we may find God, because all Truth and all Beauty
is from Him, and to Him alone are they to be referred. That the
restoration of good models, those same models which, as the historian
Socrates informs us,<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> had been studied by Christians from
the very first centuries of the Church for the sake of grace of
elocution and the culture of the mind, was in itself lawful and
desirable, does not appear a point requiring proof. Nevertheless,
it is evident that the revolution effected in the studies of Christendom
by the introduction of this new element, was one which demanded
very powerful safeguards both on the side of faith and morals; and
falling, as it did, under the direction of a race of captious and greedy
professors, it resulted at last in grievous excesses which threatened
little short of an extinction of Christian ideas altogether.</p>

<p>Already we begin to see the tide of learning dividing its waters
into two streams, running in contrary directions. The close of the
fourteenth century was illustrated, it is true, by a crowd of saintly
men, who endeavoured to establish schools of sacred art and literature
in the convents which they established or reformed. At Fiesole,
St. Antoninus of Florence passed through his noviciate, in company
with Beato Angelico, whilst, contemporary with them were St.
Bernardine of Sienna, and St. John Capestran, the two Franciscan
apostles, the former of whom drew half the Florentine grammar-masters
to listen to his eloquence, while the latter terrified the
fashionable ladies who thronged to his sermons into sacrificing
their perfumes, dice, and false hair, of which he had the satisfaction of
making several bonfires. An attentive study of the monuments, as
well as of the literary history of the times, will, however, reveal significant
tokens of the existence of a very different element from that which
appears in the paintings of Angelico. It is remarkable that he formed
no school, and found none to inherit his ideas. After his time,
Christian art, the faithful exponent of the popular mind, daily lost
something of the chaste severity of former times; there was a growing
disposition in favour of more florid ornamentation in architecture, of
a freer naturalism in painting, and of a capricious effeminacy even in
sacred music, which destroyed the solemn religious character of the
ancient chant. This latter abuse was severely reprehended by Pope
John XXII. in his Bull, entitled <cite>Docta Sanctorum</cite>, wherein he complains
of the innovations introduced by “certain disciples of a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span>
school, who, employing their whole attention in marking time,
endeavour, by new notes, to express airs of their own invention to
the prejudice of the ancient chants.” In this, as in everything else,
the mischief was chiefly effected by the professors, who were gradually
assuming a sort of dictatorship in literature and the arts, and
who, whether they lectured, sang, or painted, sought as their main
object, not the solid instruction of their hearers, or the symbolism
of divine truths, but merely the display of their own talents.</p>

<p>The literary movement did not at first extend itself very rapidly
beyond the Alps, and in France particularly many circumstances
combined to check for a time the progress of letters. King Charles
V. had indeed a taste for the sciences, and founded a royal library
at the Louvre containing 900 volumes, and forming what his accomplished
biographer, Christine de Pisa, calls “une belle assemblée de
notables livres moult bien escripts, et richement adornés.” She was
the daughter of his Venetian astronomer, the authoress of fifteen
volumes in prose and verse, and was, as Tiraboschi affirms, well
acquainted with Greek. The king, however, found few among his
courtiers to share his learned tastes. The knights and nobles who
fought at Creçy piqued themselves on their ignorance of letters as a
sign of their gentle blood, and it is no uncommon thing to find a
formula like the following attached to public deeds of the fourteenth
century:&mdash;“Lequel a déclaré ne savoir signer, attendu sa qualité de
gentilhomme.” Eustache Deschamps, who wrote during the reigns
of John and Charles V., bitterly complains of the ignorance of the
upper classes as contrasted with those of an earlier generation.
Formerly, he says, nobles studied the liberal arts until their twentieth
year, before receiving knighthood; now they begin their education
on horseback, abandon learning to men of meaner birth, and give
themselves up to gaming and profligacy. He praises the older days
of chivalry, when knights loved truth, virtue, and loyal love, and were
not ashamed of being thought clerks, “car meilleur temps fut le temps
ancien.” Alain Chartier, another writer of the same period, makes
similar complaints. “Gentlemen live now,” he says, “as if they were
only made to eat and drink; and everywhere you hear the ridiculous
saying that it is unbecoming for a nobleman to know how to read and
write. It used not so to be in the days when men held an ignorant
king to be a crowned ass.” Nor are the accounts of the actual state
of the University of Paris much more satisfactory. The schools were
filled with teachers who introduced both philosophical and theological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
errors, and the Latinity of the Parisians is said to have been worse
than that of their English neighbours. Discipline too was beginning
to flag, and in 1366 the Faculty of Arts had to publish a decree of
reformation, from which it appears that the regents had begun to open
their schools at a later hour, and to introduce the hitherto unknown
luxury of benches in place of the time-honoured bundles of straw.
With the exception of a few great names, such as those of Gerson and
Nicholas Oresme, this period is a dreary and barren one in the
literary annals of France. And the sterility of her schools at this
precise epoch is a remarkable and significant fact. It was exactly
the period when the peculiar political doctrines of the Paris doctors
appeared to have won their triumph. Adapting the principles of the
old imperial jurisprudence to the circumstances of Christian Europe,
if they did not actually identify the offices of Emperor and Pontiff,
they yet put forth doctrines which virtually implied a species of royal
supremacy. Gerson’s teaching on the same subject, if less absolute,
was not more orthodox, and tended to make men regard the Pontifical
dignity as a human thing which could be legislated for according
to principles of human policy. National vanity came in to swell the
pretensions of the Parisian doctors. France was the centre of
Christendom, and the heart of France was the University. “Not
Rome, but France,” said Nicholas Oresme, in his oration to Urban
V., “is the country beloved by God. Charlemagne transplanted the
liberal sciences from Rome to Paris, whose doctors may be compared
to the stars of the firmament and the voice of many thunders; and
on that <em>holy soil</em>, therefore, and not at Rome, ought the Pope to reside.”
This sort of eloquence was continually reproduced in the treatises on
the temporal and spiritual powers which poured forth from the pens
of the Paris legists, who were the first to adhere to the Antipope,
Clement VII., thus involving France in the guilt of the Great Schism,
and whose influence, fifty years later, at the Schismatical Council
of Basle, obtained the pretended deposition of Eugenius IV., and the
election of another Antipope, Felix V. Nay, so thoroughly was the
University of Paris in love with schism, that when, in 1438, King
Charles VIII. ordered all his subjects to acknowledge the authority
of Eugenius, she alone refused to obey: the Antipope had been a
creature of her own fabrication, and she obstinately clung to his
fortunes.</p>

<p>On schools which had thus deliberately cut themselves off
from the source of benediction the blessing of fertility could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span>
rest.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> No dew fell on them, and it was as if the clouds had been commanded
that they should rain no rain upon them. Moreover, the
frightful wars that desolated France for 150 years were adverse to the
spread of letters. In them even Protestant historians have recognised
the marked and terrible retribution of sacrilegious crime. The long
struggle between Philip le Bel and Pope Boniface VIII. terminated,
in 1303, in what seemed the complete triumph of the Crown. Not
only had Philip firmly asserted the independence of the temporal
power, but to secure his victory he had calumniated the Vicar of
Christ by accusing him before all Europe as a sorcerer, a heretic, an
infidel, and a simonist. His two infamous satellites, William de
Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna, had entered Anagni with the banner
of France displayed, crying aloud, “Death to the Pope, and long
live the King of France!” They seized the venerable old man of
eighty-six, as he sat awaiting them, with passive courage, on his throne,
with the cross in his hand and the tiara on his brow, and treated
him with indignities which hastened, if they did not actually cause,
his death. And then the seat of the Popes was transferred from
Rome to Avignon, a calamitous event which weakened their independent
power, and eventually plunged the Church into schism.
Respect for the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff declined apace in
the schools of France, and it became fashionable for her lawyers and
doctors to discuss the question how far that authority extended, and
to affix limits to it of their own devising. All this was doubtless a
great victory, and seemed to be something very like the triumph of
the secular over the spiritual power. But it was a triumph terribly
avenged. At the time when these fancied successes crowned the
daring policy of Philip le Bel, he was in the flower of his age,
surrounded by his three sons, all inheritors of their father’s beauty,
and promising to carry on the glories of his race to distant generations.
But the King, in the forty-seventh year of his age, was killed
by a wild boar; his sons, one by one, followed each other, heirless,
to the tomb; at one and the same time the disgraceful crimes of
their three wives were published to the world; and the crown passed
from his family&mdash;and <em>to whom?</em> To the son of Charles de Valois,
the friend and captain-general of Boniface VIII., who had refused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
to take part in his brother’s crimes, and always remained loyal to the
injured Pontiff. But this was not all. A daughter of Philip le Bel
still survived, the she-wolf of France, who, after dyeing her hands in
the blood of her husband, King Edward II. of England, left to her
son, Edward III., those fatal claims which brought upon France the
outpouring of the cup of vengeance. Those golden fleurs-de-lys,
which Dante had beheld borne in triumph through the gates of
Anagni, were rolled and trampled in the dust for a century and a half
by English descendants of that very king who had fondly thought to
establish his royal power on the humiliation of the Vicar of Christ.
France was brought to the very lowest abyss of ignominy, and had
to witness the coronation in her capital of an English conqueror, who
quartered those same dishonoured lilies on his shield. What more
need be said? History teaches many lessons, but there is one which
she repeats through all ages with unvarying fidelity. It is vain for
the kings of the earth to stand up against the Lord and against His
Christ. It is idle for them in their mad presumption to dash themselves
against the Rock of Peter; for “whoso falls on that Rock
shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him
to powder.”</p>

<p class="pfs90">ENGLISH EDUCATION IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1300 TO 1400.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the French wars were hardly less injurious to the cause
of polite learning in England than in France, the reigns of Edward
III. and his successors are not without a peculiar interest in the
history of our popular education. One after another those magnificent
foundations were rising at the universities, the commencement
of which has been noticed in a previous chapter; and the English
collegiate system was taking root and attaining maturity. The
threefold pestilence of Lollardism, the Black Death, and a rage for
military glory, offered, it is true, some serious checks to the progress
of letters; yet in spite of every such disadvantage, this epoch, so
brilliant in the annals of chivalry, was hardly less important in those
of English literature, which in Chaucer and Mandeville produced
its first writers in prose and verse. And, indeed, if the reign of
Edward III. was not a splendid literary era the fault is not to be
charged to the deficient education of the sovereign. His great
natural powers had been cultivated with extraordinary care under
the direction of Richard Angervyle, or, as he is commonly called,
Richard of Bury. The most learned scholar of his age, Richard was
also a very great man as far as dignities could make him so:
Archdeacon of Northampton, Prebendary of Lincoln, Salisbury, and
Lichfield, Dean of Wells, and finally Bishop of Durham; Lord High
Chancellor and Treasurer of the Kingdom, and Envoy Plenipotentiary
for concluding the peace with France. Posterity, however, has
forgotten his honours, and remembers him rather as the patron of
learning, the correspondent of Petrarch, the founder of the Angervyle
library at Oxford, and the author of the <cite>Philobiblion</cite>, a book in the
compilation of which he was largely assisted by the learned Dominican
Robert Holkot, and in which he gives full expression to that devouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
passion for books, wherewith, says Harpsfield, “he was mightily
carried away.” His library was the first public one ever founded in
England. He bestowed it on Durham college, which he completed
and partly endowed, and made the inheritor of his books, of which,
says Wood, he had more than all the other bishops of England put
together. All his palaces were crammed with them, and the floor
of the room where he sat was so strewn with them that it was no easy
thing to approach him. He kept three collectors constantly employed
for him in France, Germany, and Italy. In his palace a staff of
writers, illuminators, and binders were constantly at work under his
own eye, and he gives ample details in his work of the incredible
pains and expense he was at to complete his collection. It was
undertaken in no light or capricious mood, but as a serious and
solemn duty. “Moved,” he says, “by Him who alone granteth and
perfecteth a good will to man, I diligently inquired what, among all
the offices of piety, would most please the Almighty, and most profit
the Church militant. Then before the eyes of our mind there came
a flock of chosen scholars in whom God, the artificer, and His handmaid
Nature, had indeed planted the roots of the best manners and
sciences, but whom penury so oppressed that they were dried up and
watered by no dew; and so they who might have grown up strong
columns of the Church were obliged to renounce their studies.
Deprived of the writings and helps of contemplation they return, for
the sake of bread, to base mechanical arts. And the result of our
meditation was pity for this humble race of men, and the resolution
to help them, not only with the means of sustenance, but also with
books for the prosecution of their studies; and to this end our
intention ever watched before the Lord. And this ecstatic love so
moved us that, renouncing all other earthly things, we applied
ourselves to collect books.”</p>

<p>In his bibliographical researches the still unplundered monasteries
afforded him an inexhaustible mine of literary treasures. Whenever
he visited towns where there existed religious houses, his first visit
was paid to their libraries; and he was not slow in examining their
chests and other repositories where books might lie concealed. Often
amid the greatest poverty he found the rarest stores; and the richest
in this kind of wealth, as well as the most liberal in dispensing the
use of it, were the Friars Preachers. Sometimes, however, he had
complaints to make of the carelessness and indifference of those
possessed of books, which he often found “turned out of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>
interior chambers and secure depositories, and given over to destruction
for the sake of dogs, birds, and those two-legged beasts called
women.”</p>

<p>No catalogue of the Angervyle collection now exists, and at the
Reformation it was dispersed, and in great measure destroyed by
the Protestant plunderers, who saw a vision of Popery in every
illuminated manuscript. But there can be little doubt that it was
rich in works of high literary value. For the good bishop was one
of those who esteemed the liberal arts above the study of law, and
he expressly tells us that he provided his students with Greek and
Hebrew grammars. He gave them also very quaint and pithy
directions how to use his books. They were to take care how they
opened and shut them, not to mark them with their nails, or write
alphabets on the margin of the leaves. He criticises the bad habits
of indolent and careless youths, who lean both their elbows on their
books, put straws and flowers to keep their places, and eat fruit and
cheese over the open pages; and he exhorts those into whose hands
his treasures may fall, to wash their hands before reading, and to take
a little more care of their books than they would of an old shoe.</p>

<p>Several other prelates imitated the laudable example of Richard
of Bury, and endeavoured to make provision for the wants of poor
scholars by the foundation of public libraries. It is probable, however,
that most of these collections were extremely limited in their
range. The English universities were at this time almost exclusively
resorted to by lawyers and ecclesiastics, or, in other words, by those
who had chosen the calling of <em>clerks</em>. They were not, as they afterwards
became, and as they continue to be in our day, places of
liberal education for the sons of the gentry; and hence the education
given in them had a certain professional narrowness; a defect
which was further increased at this particular period, by the presence
among the students of a very large proportion of beneficed clergymen,
who having been appointed from an inferior class to fill up
the vacancies caused by the ravages of the Black Death, were often
found so ignorant as to render it necessary for their diocesans to
require their spending a certain time at the universities, in order
to acquire just so much learning as was actually indispensable for
their office. Men of this sort, of course, spent little time on polite
literature, and the influence of such a class of students was,
naturally enough, to pull down the academical studies to a very low
standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span></p>

<p>It will occur to every reader to inquire where the sons of the
gentry received their education, if they were not as yet in the habit
of frequenting the universities and public schools. And to furnish a
reply, we must call to mind the habits which prevailed in feudal
society, according to which every great baron or prelate presided
over a huge household, including, besides his domestic servants and
chaplains, a crowd of knights, esquires, and pages, among the last of
whom a certain number of noble youths were always admitted, in
order to receive the training suited to their rank. Chivalry, it will
be remembered, was not an accident, but an institution, and one
which was furnished with a rigorous system of graduation. A man
who aspired to the profession of arms, had to be trained for it
according to fixed rules, and to go through each successive degree
with as much precision as the bachelors and masters in the schools.
Indeed, the feudal castles may not unfitly be called schools of
chivalry, and in them alone could the future knight be instructed in
the duties of his state. As page in a baronial household, a youth
was able to acquire an education far more suited to his future
position in the world, than he could possibly have received at the
universities. There he would have been chiefly called on to
attend lectures on the Sentences, or on civil and canon law; but as
page to a great lord, spiritual or temporal, he learnt how to serve
and carve at table, to fly a hawk, manage and dress a horse, bear
himself in the tilt-yard, and handle his arms. Noble youths generally
began their education at the age of seven, when they were
admitted to the service of the ladies of the family, and were styled
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Damoiseaux</i>. They were under the immediate control of the lady
of the house, and learnt from her at once their Christian doctrine
and the laws of courtesy.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> I say, the <em>laws</em>, for the teaching of this
virtue was reduced to a science, and had a literature of its own. By
the fair virtue of courtesy our forefathers understood something
more than the mere outside polish of worldly refinement. The
author of the “Lytylle childrene’s lytylle boke” informs us that
according to cunning clerks&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">“Alle vertues are closide yn curteseye,” he says, “and alle vices in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533"></a>[533]</span>
vyllonie;” and he goes on to teach his pupils that they must love
God and their neighbours, speak the truth, keep their word, and
neither swear, quarrel, nor be idle. They are not to be proud or to
scorn the poor, and are to speak honestly whether it be to the lord
or to his servants. If his directions how to behave at table are
somewhat homely, it cannot be denied that they are much to the
point, and Dame Curtesye forgets not to remind her scholars that
before eating they should think of the poor, because a full stomach
wots little what the hungry ails.</p>

<p>As the boy grew older he came under the training of the seneschal
and the chaplain. The first, who was generally some old veteran
knight, taught him his martial duties, while the other imbued him
with a reasonable amount of book-learning in Latin and Norman-French.
The ignorance of French knights in Du Guesclin’s time
must not be held to disprove this latter statement, for it is plain
that ignorance was opposed to the older traditions of chivalry, and
was commented upon as a sign of decay by writers of the time.
Knights were certainly expected to know how to read and write, for
the youthful aspirant to chivalric honours, who, in the twelfth
century, wandered from land to land seeking goodly adventures, was
always required to carry tablets, and note down the deeds which he
witnessed most worthy of remembrance and imitation. He was
required to know something of the tuneful art, whether the plain
song of the Church, or the lays of the troubadours, and, as a matter
of course, every well bred man was well instructed in the abstruse
science of heraldry. Chaucer, in describing his squire, takes care
to let us know that besides sitting his horse, carving at table, and
jousting in the lists, he could sing, write songs, dance, “and wel
pourtraie and write.” The education of his mind, then, was not
entirely neglected, and still less was that of his manners. He was
“courteous, lowlie, and serviceable;” and elsewhere the same
authority informs us, that the young squire was often charged to be
wise and equitable, godly in word, and reasonable, to be courteous
in salute, and to abstain from all words of ribaldry, “and fro all
pride to keep him well.” The last words are worthy of notice, for
this eschewing of pride is greatly insisted on by all chivalric writers
as one of the special characteristics of a gentleman. It is a point
on which Chaucer constantly loves to dwell:&mdash;</p>

<p>Exactly in the same spirit does the good king Perceforest in the
old romance instruct his knights: “Si me souvient d’une parolle
que ung hermite me dist une fois pour moy chastier. Car il me dist
que si j’avois autant de possessions comme avoit le roy Alexandre,
de sens comme le sage Salomon, et de bravoure comme le preux
Hector de Troy, seul orgueil, s’il regnoit en moy, destruieroit tout.”
And in a book of instructions on the duties of Chivalry, we find the
following: “Louange est reputée blâme en la bouche de celluy qui
se loe, mais elle exaulce celluy qui ne se attribue point de louange,
mais à Dieu. Si l’ecuyer a vaine gloire de ce qu’il a fait, il n’est pas
digne d’étre chevalier, car vaine gloire est un vice qui destruit les
merites de chevalerie.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> In the same Treatise the virtues of chivalry
are declared to be the three theological and the four cardinal virtues,
and a good knight will hold the opposite vices in horror; he must
keep himself from villanous thoughts, and be unstained within and
without, and must withal be modest, “the first to strike on the
battle-field, but the last to speak in the hall.”</p>

<p>Schools in which maxims such as these prevailed, and in which
the duties of religion were strictly enforced, must be admitted to fill
an important place in the system of Christian education. It may be
doubted, too, whether Eton or Rugby could bestow a more careful
polish than was inculcated by that minute etiquette which chivalric
usage demanded. The grace and manliness, the “pluck” and spirit
which Englishmen prize so highly, and purchase at so dear a rate,
were certainly not disregarded; but they were tempered with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535"></a>[535]</span>
certain admixture of lowliness which has not retained an equal
place in our esteem. Despite all the extravagances of Chivalry, and
the exaggerated and injurious effect of some of its maxims, such as
those which inculcated a heathenish sensitiveness on the point of
honour, it enforced a law of self-restraint, a polite diction and
etiquette, and a government of the exterior man, in all which
the education of our own day is fatally defective. “One of the
essential principles of chivalry,” says Godwin, speaking of the
education bestowed on noble youths in these baronial households,
“was, that no office was sordid that was performed in aid of a proper
object. It was the pride of the candidate for knighthood to attend
upon his superiors, and perform for them the most menial services.
The dignity of the person assisted raised the employment, and the
generous spirit in which it was performed gave it lustre and grace.
It was the office of a page or an esquire to spread the table, to carve
the meat, to wait upon the guests, to bring them water to wash, and
conduct them to their bed-chamber. They cleaned and kept in
order the arms of their lord, and assisted him in equipping himself
for the field. There is an exquisite beauty in offices like these, not
the growth of servitude, not rendered with unwillingness and constraint,
but the spontaneous acts of reverence and affection performed
by a servant of mind not less free and noble than the honoured master
whom he serves.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The truth and justice of this observation will be
readily admitted, and we stop and ask ourselves what substitute has
our increased civilisation furnished for this beautiful element in the
education of the Middle Ages? Where, except among the fags below
the fifth form, does a noble youth of our day learn anything of these
“lowly and serviceable” courtesies; and are they there performed
in that spirit of “spontaneous reverence and affection,” which
renders them not sordid, but illustrious? We must leave it to our
public schoolmen to reply.</p>

<p>Such an education as has been described above, taught exactly
what a secular youth of good birth now goes to the universities to
acquire&mdash;it taught him to be a gentleman. And it is probable that
in these chivalric households he received the culture suited to his
position with more safeguards to faith and morals than would have
been found in the schools of Paris or Oxford. In those days the
government of the family was the active, earnest business of the lord
and lady; noble rank was not held to dispense a baron and a baron’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536"></a>[536]</span>
wife from seeing to very homely details with their own eyes; and the
everyday habits of their retainers were regulated by them in a way
which put into their hands a vast parental power. Doubtless this
“wondrous middle age” had plenty of barbarous violence, and was
disgraced by much gross immorality; nor do we aim at painting it
other than it was. But, whatever were its failings, it had one merit,&mdash;the
Family Life was then a reality and not a name.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Most readers
are familiar with the beautiful picture of the household of Sir Thomas
More, which all his biographers agree in holding up as a model and
pattern, though possibly an exceptional form of excellence. It was
exceptional, however, only in its extraordinary cultivation of letters;
in every other respect it did but present the old Catholic type, of
which we might adduce innumerable specimens both in earlier and
later times. Let us see what sort of rules were drawn up by a
French earl of the fourteenth century for the regulation of his household,
just premising that this is not an exceptional case, but that any
acquaintance with mediæval literature will convince the reader that
Elzear de Sabran ruled his family as many a good knight of France
and England besides him were doing at the same period. Elzear
had the greatest of all blessings, a good mother, whose piety and
charity had earned her the golden title of “The Good Countess.”
When he was born she took him in her arms and offered him to God,
and had him educated by his uncle in the abbey of St. Victor’s at
Marseilles. But he did not become a monk or a clerk: on the
contrary, he lived as a great baron, fought as a brave soldier,
administered justice to his feudal retainers, and was employed as
ambassador from the King of Naples to the court of France. He
was at the head of the State Council of Naples, and fought two
pitched battles against the Emperor Henry VII., so that I think we
need have no mistaken notion as to his being a mere pious recluse.
Like other nobles of the time, he received a number of youths into
his house, among whom was the eldest son of King Robert himself:
Duke Charles of Calabria, a circumstance which induces us to think
that a certain instruction in letters must have been given to the
pages, for this King Robert was the same who acted as examiner to
Petrarch, and was used to say that if he must choose between his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537"></a>[537]</span>
crown and his studies, the latter should have the preference. Surius
tells us that Elzear took great pains with the duke’s education,
explaining to him the principles of piety, justice, and clemency,
making him frequent the Sacraments, and advising him to keep
flatterers at a distance. His wife, Delphina of Glandeves, was
worthy of directing a Christian household; she looked to all things
with her own eye, banished brawls and tale-bearing, and was honoured
by her servants as a mother and a saint. When first they began to
keep house at Puy-Michel, in Provençe, Elzear drew up rules for the
regulation of his family, of which the following is a short abridgment:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Every one in my family shall daily hear Mass. Let no one curse,
swear, or blaspheme, under pain of chastisement. Let all persons
honour chastity, for no impure word or deed shall go unpunished in
the house of Elzear. The men and women shall confess their sins
every week, and communicate every month, or at the least at the
chief festivals, namely, Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, and on the
feasts of our Lady. No one shall be idle, but in the morning, after
prayers, let all go to their work, the men abroad, the women at
home. The life of the pious woman is not merely to pray, but to
ply her work, and take care of her household. Therefore, the
ladies shall read and pray in the mornings, and afterwards spend
their time in useful work of some kind. Every evening all my
family shall assemble for a pious conference, in which they shall
hear something said for the salvation of their souls. And let none
be absent on pretence of attending to my affairs. I have no affairs
so near my heart as the salvation of those who serve me. I will
have no playing at dice or games of hazard; there are plenty of
innocent diversions, and time passes soon enough without being
thrown away: yet I do not wish my castle to be a cloister, nor my
people hermits. Therefore, let them be merry, but without offending
God. If any quarrel fall out, let not the sun set before it be
appeased. And I strictly command all under my jurisdiction to
hurt no man in goods, honour, or reputation. I will not have my
coffers filled by the emptying of others; we shall be wealthy enough
if we fear God.”</p>

<p>The nobles educated in such households are often spoken of in
after-life as evincing a certain love of polite letters, such as Count
Capranica, whom Petrarch describes as living in his feudal castle,
“governing his vassals with justice and love, cultivating the Muses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538"></a>[538]</span>
and seeking the society of the learned.” Ordinarily speaking, however,
the merits of the mediæval system of education for the upper
ranks lay less in its intellectual than in its moral training. It is true
indeed that all great barons and their wives were not Elzears and
Delphinas, but it is probable that the families usually chosen as
homes for the young were those which were held in highest repute
as virtuous and well-ordered. And in such families we are justified
in saying that, as a general rule, the grand Christian traditions were
certainly upheld; that children were taught to be subject to parents
and governors, and parents were held bound personally to superintend
the education of their children; that there was a real parental
rule, that priests were had in worshipful honour, the poor regarded
as the members of Christ, women treated with respect and courtesy,
and elders had in reverence. The domestic virtues were taught after
another fashion than among ourselves, and whilst the education of a
gentleman aimed at making him brave, clement, courteous, and
devout, a high-born lady was trained to a life of vigorous practical
utility. She learnt to fill the responsible office of head of the family,
which demanded in those days no small capacity of government.
She was instructed in a hundred details of domestic life, which ladies
are now-a-days content to entrust to their servants. No great variety
of accomplishments was of course expected of her; and the
author of the “Advice to Ladies,” written in 1371, enumerates
reading, church music, embroidery, confectionery, and surgery as
among the most useful branches of female education. As to writing,
he considers it superfluous, and thinks it better if women
“can nought of it.”</p>

<p>In the same spirit the good housewife is addressed in the
“Menagier de Paris,” and exhorted to take both pains and pleasure
in her household duties. She is expected to know something about
gardening and tillage, to be able to choose grooms, porters, and
other servants, and look after labourers, pastrycooks, bakers, shoemakers,
and chambermaids; to see that the sheep and horses are
taken care of, and the wines kept clear. Moreover, she must know
what to order for dinner and supper, and must understand how to make
all manner of ragôuts, and pottages for the sick. Much account was
made of early rising in all the books of instruction addressed to
ladies. The “Menagier” humorously complains of those sluggards
whose Matins are, “I must sleep a little longer,” and their Lauds,
“Is breakfast ready yet?” But in general it was the habit to rise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span>
with the lark, and give the early hours, as in Elzear’s household, to
prayer and reading. Thus an old French poet describes it&mdash;</p>

<p>Such homely duties as those enumerated above might seem to
leave but little room for cultivation of letters. Probably the writers
of these treatises made the most of their subject, but it is quite clear
that the “Valiant women” of olden time were not mere homely housewives,
innocent of intellectual culture, and with no ideas beyond their
distaffs and their confectioneries; on the contrary, many of them were
learned in their way, like the saintly Isabel of France, sister to St.
Louis, who was an excellent spinster, but was also well read in
St. Augustine. Froissart incidentally lets us know that many of the
noble ladies he names in his Chronicle were lovers of learning; such
as Mary de Bohun, the first wife of Henry Bolingbroke, who, as he
tells us, was well skilled in Latin and Church Divinity. And the
character of not a few of those grand heroic women, whose names so
beautify the page of history, might be summed up in the words with
which Gabrielle de Bourbon is described by the biographer of Bayard.
“She was,” he says, “devout, religious, chaste, and charitable; grave
without haughtiness, magnanimous without pride, and not ignorant
of letters, specially delighting in reading and hearing read the Sacred
Scriptures.” The considerable part taken in the foundation of the
English Colleges by noble ladies of the fourteenth century shows
that they were, at any rate, not indifferent to learning. I have
already spoken of Ella Longspée and the Lady Devorgilla, and in
the following century their noble example was followed by Philippa
of Hainault, the foundress of Queen’s College, Oxford, and Mary de
St. Pol, the widowed countess of Pembroke, who founded Pembroke
College, Cambridge, and was chosen on account of her virtue and
learning to direct the education of Queen Philippa’s daughters.
No one can study the histories of those times without being
frequently struck by the superiority which appears in the characters
of their illustrious women. Their education, however slender it may
have been in a merely literary sense (and, if less showy, it was
perhaps quite as solid as what finds favour among ourselves),
evidently fitted them to take an active and intelligent part in domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
and social life. The old chroniclers often allude to the happy
influence exerted over their lords by such queens as Eleanor of
Castile, and the Good Queen Maud. Not a few English countesses
merited the praises bestowed on Ildegard by the historian Donizzo,
who calls her <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docta, gubernatrix, prudens, proba, consiliatrix</i>. The
practical mind of Philippa of Hainault was employed in introducing
useful arts into England, just as, a few years later, the intelligence
and commanding powers of Margaret, “the Great Countess” of
Ormonde, were similarly exercised in Ireland, where she planted
weavers and other artisans, built schoolhouses, and “was ever showing
herself liberal, bountiful, and devout.” They who would understand
the character of a true Catholic household, presided over by a
wise and intelligent mistress, may find it depicted in countless beautiful
pictures, both of history and romance. Thus, in one of the works
translated by Caxton, the Knight of the Tower holds up for the
imitation of his daughters the example of the Lady Cecily of Balleville,
whose daily ordinance was to rise early and say matins with her
chaplains, and then to hear High Mass and two low Masses, “saying
her service full devoutly.” Then she walked in her garden, and
finished her other morning devotions, and betimes she dined. After
dinner she visited sick folk, and caused her best meat to be brought
to them, and spent her day in other charitable and useful works.
After hearing vespers she went to supper, and betimes to bed,
making great abstinence, and wearing haircloth on all Wednesdays
and Fridays. In the same volume we find that the maxims of
courtesy and humility which found place in the training of a gentleman
were equally inculcated on noble ladies. The Knight of the
Tower reminds his daughters that courtesy is to be shown to persons
of low degree as well as those of gentle blood, and even more
scrupulously, and he gives his reasons. “Courtesy shewn to those
of low estate,” he says, “is more honourable than that shewn to the
great, because it the more evidently proceedeth from a frank and
gentle heart.” He cites the example of a certain great lady whom
he once saw in company with some fine knights and ladies, and who
humbled herself to curtsey, as she passed, to a poor tinker; and when
her gay companions asked her why she did so, she replied, “I would
rather miss shewing such courtesy to a gentleman than to him.”
And this, he says, is what all understand and practise who know the
laws of true courtesy.</p>

<p>What has been said of the character of domestic life in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
Middle Ages will doubtless seem a partial view to those who consider
that we ought to gather our notions of the state of society
then prevailing from the debased literature of the jongleurs and troubadours,
which is universally acknowledged to have been exceedingly
bad. It will be remembered, however, that the “goliardi,” as they
were called, were a distinct class in society, the dead branches of the
universities, men who followed no profession save that of buffoonery,
and had gathered just so much education in school as enabled them
to give point to a licentious song or story. They wandered about
from city to city and from castle to castle; and in days when no
places of public amusement existed, there were plenty of knights and
nobles ready to receive such guests, and to while away the dulness
of a winter’s evening by listening to their narratives. The appetite
for recreation in an unregenerate world is hardly less clamorous in
its demands than the appetite for food, and the goods which are
produced to supply such a demand, are seldom, even in our own
more refined age, of the choicest description. But to take the
offensive literature produced by a corrupt and excommunicated class,
for such the “goliardi” really were,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and draw thence any conclusions
respecting the manners of the higher classes in ancient times,
is about as fair as it would be to judge of the state of society among
ourselves by the plot of a “sensation” novel or a French vaudeville.
Even allowing the character of their fictions to be taken as evidence
of the existence of widespread scandals, at least equal weight must
be attached to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</i> historical descriptions of households such
as those of Elzear or Charles the Wise, of whom Christine de Pisa
says that he suffered no pernicious book to remain in his palace for
a single day; nor any person whose language was not pure and
innocent. Mr. Wright expresses his surprise at the inconceivable
corruption of a society which could endure the goliardic tales to be
recited in its presence. But it would be easy to match the instances
which he brings forward with others which show us the domestic
circle amusing itself in a very different manner, like that in the
castle of Count Charles of Flanders, who entertained three monks,
doctors of theology, that they might daily, after supper, read and
explain the Scriptures to his family; or like that again, of the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
king named above, who always kept readers in his palace to relieve
the winter evenings by reading aloud “les belles ystoires de la sainct
Escripture, ou des fais des Romains, ou moralitées de philosophes,
et d’autres sciences;” and examples of this sort are by no means
exceptional.</p>

<p>What, however, we are chiefly concerned with, is not so much the
practice of this or that individual, as the character of the education
by which they were trained. Our inquiry is what were the principles
and the standard of morals enforced in the chivalric system of education.
And the fact that this standard was far higher than what
exists among ourselves, has been acknowledged by writers whose
sympathies are all in another direction. Thus, M. Guizot, whose
study of European civilisation has certainly not been superficial,
expresses his admiration at “the moral notions, so delicate, so elevated,
and above all so humane, and so invariably stamped with a
religious character,” which are to be found in the oaths and obligations
imposed by the laws of chivalry. “Crimes and disorders abounded
in the Middle Ages,” he says, “yet men evidently had in their minds
lofty desires and pure ideas. Their principles were better than their
acts. A certain high moral ideal always soars above the stormy
element.” He goes on to remark that this pure tone of morality
which prevails in the laws of chivalry must be traced to the influence
of the clergy, who, though they did not invent that institution, made
it an instrument for civilising society and introducing “a more enlarged
and vigorous system of morality in domestic life.” Expressions like
these, which are abundantly confirmed by a study of the ancient
monuments, justify us in claiming for the mediæval system of education
the merit of at least presenting to the world a lofty standard
of right and wrong. That the acts of the pupils often fell far below
their principles, is saying no more than that they were men. But it
cannot be supposed that society could be permeated with a high
moral ideal, and that the strict obligations of that class to which
every man of gentle blood belonged, should be redolent of a spirit at
once “delicate, scrupulous, and humane,” without effecting some
practical results. The young were trained to reverence a whole class
of virtues which popular writers declare must be regarded in our own
day as “dead.” The system of education which prevailed, presented
them with a high ideal of moral excellence, a lofty standard of
thoughts and desires, precisely that, the loss of which among ourselves
is so bitterly deplored. And what is all education but the formation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543"></a>[543]</span>
of such an interior standard? A teacher can do little more than
grave on the soul principles which may survive many practical shortcomings,
and may eventually recall a wanderer to better things.
This is a point which non-Catholic writers can hardly be expected to
appreciate as it deserves, bound up as it is with a class of ideas, and
even of dogmas, to which they are necessarily strangers. But whilst
acknowledging the contrast too frequently observable between the
profession and the practice of Christians in the Middle Ages, another
remarkable feature in those extraordinary times ought not to be overlooked,&mdash;I
mean those numerous episodes in history which exhibit
its great criminals in the light of great penitents. There had been
early impressed on those fierce hearts a fear of God, a sense of sin,
and a living faith in the possibility of obtaining pardon; nay, we
will add, a certain capacity of self-humiliation, which evoked grand
heroic acts of contrition from many whose previous lives had been a
tissue of enormities; and thus a man like William Longspée needed
but the look and the word of a saint to feel all the old teaching
reawaken in his soul, and with a rope about his neck “to abhor
himself in dust and ashes.”</p>

<p>To return from this digression, which is yet intimately connected
with our subject, let us proceed to examine a little more closely the
actual schools for rich and poor existing in England in the fourteenth
century. Besides the universities and monastic schools, there were,
as we have already seen, others presided over by independent
masters. Schools of greater or less pretension were attached to
most parish churches, and the scholars assembled either in the
church, or the porch, or “parvis.” Thus in 1300 we read of children
being taught to sing and read in the “parvis” of St. Martin’s,
Norwich. Endowed schools in connection with hospitals and
colleges were also springing up, of which we shall speak more fully
in another chapter, and in all these schools, as well as in the universities,
the studies, up to the latter part of the reign of Edward III.,
were carried on in Latin and French. Ralph Higden, a monk of
Chester, who wrote his <cite>Polychronicon</cite> somewhere about the year 1357,
informs us that in his day French was the only language which
schoolboys were allowed to use, except Latin. The passage as
translated by John de Trevisa in 1387 is as follows: “Children in
scoles agenst the usage and maner of all other nations beeth compelled
for to leve thir own language, and for to construe thir lessons
and thinges in Frenche. Also gentylmen children beeth taught to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span>
speke Frenche, from the time that they beeth rokked in thir cradel.
And uplondish men (<em>i.e.</em> country people) will lyken hymself to
gentylmen and soundeth with gret besynesse for to speke Frenche
to be told of.” When Ralph was protesting against this custom its
knell was about to sound. In 1362 the celebrated statute was passed
which ordained that all pleadings in the Royal courts should now
be made in English instead of French, a change for which we stand
indebted to the spirit of nationality called forth by the continental
wars. By the time therefore that John of Trevisa wrote his translation
of the <cite>Polychronicon</cite>, a great revolution had taken place, so that
he thought it necessary to introduce this correction into the body of
his work: “This maner (the use of the French language) is now
som dele ychaungide: for John Cornwaile, a maister of gramer,
chaungide the lore in gramer scole and construction of Frensch, into
Englisch, and Richard Pencriche lerned that maner of teching of
him, and other men of Pencriche; so that now the yere of oure
Lord a thousand thre hundred foure score and fyve, of the secunde
king Rychard after the conquest, in alle the gramer scoles of England,
children leveth Frensch, and construeth and lerneth in Englisch,
and haveth therby avauntage in one side and desavauntage in
another. Ther avauntage is, that thei lerneth ther gramer in lasse
tyme than children were wont to do; desavauntage is, that now children
of gramer scole knoweth no more Frensch than knows thir
left heele; and that is harm to them, if thei schul passe the see and
travaile in strange londes, and in many other places also: also
gentylmen haveth now myche ylefte for to teche thir children
Frensch.” It is evident that John of Cornwaile and Richard Pencriche,
were, like the author himself, Cornish men. John of Trevisa
was a Cornish priest, one of the earliest students at Exeter College,
or, as it was called at that time, Stapleton Hall, Canon of Westbury
in Wiltshire, and Vicar of Berkeley. His translation of the <cite>Polychronicon</cite>
was undertaken at the request of his Patron, Thomas Lord
Berkeley, and was afterwards modernised and continued by Caxton.
At the request of the same noble friend he is said to have undertaken
an English translation of the Old and New Testaments. Warton,
and after him Craik, have stated that no account of this work is
known to exist, and doubts have even been raised whether it were
ever really written. One antiquarian, quoted by Lewis in his History
of the Translations of the Bible, assures a “learned friend” that
Trevisa translated no more of the Scriptures than certain sentences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545"></a>[545]</span>
painted on the walls of Berkeley Castle, which sentences turn out
to have been painted in Latin and French. But the existence of
the translation is uniformly alluded to by early writers as a well-known
fact, and Dr. Ingram informs us in a note appended to his
<cite>Memorials of Oxford</cite> that in 1808 he was actually presented with a
copy of the work.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>There was the less excuse for the English gentry having eschewed
the use of the national tongue, from the fact that the language
had long since been redeemed from the character of a barbarous
idiom by the labours of the monks. Their rhyming chronicles
and a vast quantity of beautiful and pathetic poetry, attributed by
critics to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, must be regarded as
the real first-fruits of English literature; and the adherence to what
Chaucer lets us know was exceedingly bad French, in preference to
good English, was simply a remnant of Anglo-Norman pride. Chaucer
himself had to apologise for his use of the vulgar idiom, and in the
prologue to one of his prose treatises, he protests against the speaking
of “poesy matter” in French which, in the ears of Frenchmen,
is about as agreeable as a Frenchman’s English. “Let Frenchmen
endite their quaint terms in French,” he says, “for it is kindly to
their mouths; but let us show our fantasies in such words as we
learned of our dames’ tongues.” His example, of course, had great
influence; yet such was the force of this sentiment of gentility, that
at the universities the Oxonian and Cantabrian French (which was
not much better than that spoken at “Stratford-atte-Bowe”) held
its ground for some years; but in the primary schools the English
tongue asserted its supremacy, and primers and grammars began to
be divested of their foreign clothing. A great many fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546"></a>[546]</span>
English school literature exist belonging to the fourteenth century,
some of which may furnish amusement to the reader. All perhaps
may not have a very clear idea of what an ancient <em>Primer</em> really
was. It was something very different from the school books to which
we ordinarily give the name. For in the dames schools, of which
Chaucer speaks, children were provided with few literary luxuries
and had to learn their letters off a scrap of parchment nailed on a
board, and in most cases covered with a thin transparent sheet of
horn to protect the precious manuscript. Hence the term “horn-book”
applied to the elementary books in use by children. Prefixed
to the alphabet, of course, was the holy sign of the Cross; and so
firm a hold does an old custom get on the popular mind that down
to the commencement of the present century alphabets continued to
preserve their ancient heading, and derived from this circumstance
their customary appellation of “the Christ-cross row,” a term so
thoroughly established as still to find its place in our dictionaries.
The mediæval primer is, however, best described in the language of
the fourteenth century itself. The following passage occurs in the
introduction to a MS. poem of 300 lines, still preserved in the British
Museum, each portion of which begins with a separate letter of the
alphabet:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the difficulties of the primer had been overcome, a great
deal of elementary knowledge was taught to the children, as in
Saxon times, through the vehicle of verse. For instance, we find a
versified geography of the fourteenth century, of which the two
following verses may serve as a specimen, though it must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547"></a>[547]</span>
owned the second is not very creditable to our mediæval geographers:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following grammar rules are of rather later date, and belong
to the fifteenth century:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is something in this last fragment very suggestive of the
rod. What would have been the fate of the unhappy grammarian,
if in spite of this solemn counsel he had failed to have his ablative
case in his mind, we dare not conjecture. Our forefathers had strict
views on the subject of sparing the rod and spoiling the child.
Thus one old writer observes of children in general:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Who spareth the rodd all virtue sette asyde</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet the strictness was mingled, as of old, with paternal tenderness,
and children appear to have treated their masters with a singular
mixture of familiarity and reverence. And it is pleasant to find
among the same collection of school fragments a little distich which
speaks of peacemaking:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is good reason for believing that schoolboys of the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548"></a>[548]</span>
century were much what they are in the nineteenth, and fully possessed
of that love of robbing orchards, which seems peculiar to the
race. Chaucer has something to say on this head, but Lydgate’s

</div>

<p>I must, however, add a few school pictures of a graver and sweeter
character. Chaucer, who painted English society as he saw it with
his own eyes, has not forgotten to describe the village school where
“an hepe of children comen of Christen blood,” acquired as much
learning as was suitable to their age and condition:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">And among these children he describes one, “a widewe’s lytel sone,”
whom his pious mother had taught whenever he saw an image of
Christ’s Mother, to kneel down and say an Ave Maria; and he goes

<p>He was too young, however, to understand the meaning of the

Our Lady.</p>

<p>In these parochial schools, as we have elsewhere seen, children of
the lower orders, even from St Dunstan’s time, were taught grammar
and church music gratuitously. It has been very constantly affirmed
that the education here spoken of was exclusively given to those
intended for the monastic and ecclesiastical states. But there is
direct evidence, that the parochial schools were frequented by the
children of the peasantry indiscriminately, and by those of the very
lowest and poorest condition. The proof of this is to be found in
the statutes of the realm. About the year 1406 a law was passed,
wherein, after complaint being made that in opposition to certain
ancient statutes, a vast number of the children of husbandmen, <em>who
laboured with cart and plough and had no lands</em>, were apprenticed to
handicraft trades, and thereby induced a great scarcity of husbandmen
and labourers in many parts of the country, it was enacted that
henceforth no one should be allowed so to apprentice his child
to any trade, unless he rented land to the annual value of twenty
shillings. The object of this blundering and tyrannical piece of
legislation was, of course, to keep down the lower orders from endeavouring
to raise themselves in the scale of society, and to oppose
that upward movement which had been one of the results of the
enfranchisement of so large a number of feudal serfs in the reign of
Edward III. But whilst decreeing that day-labourers <em>with the cart
and plough</em> should thus be kept back from advancing, or helping their
children to advance, in point of station and wealth, the very same
statute encourages them to <em>send their children to school</em>. “Every man
or woman, of whatever state or condition they be, shall be at liberty
to send their son or daughter to take learning in any kind of school
that pleaseth them within the realm.” This clause seems to have
had reference to a petition which had been presented to parliament
by certain lords in the reign of Richard II., to the effect that children
of serfs and the lower sort might not be sent to school, and particularly
to the schools of monasteries, wherein many were trained as
ecclesiastics, and thence rose to dignities in the State. The statute
aimed at appeasing the jealous pride of the nobles, who regarded
with dismay the prospect of bondsmen and husbandmen emerging
from their state of servitude; whilst at the same time, the influence
of the ecclesiastical body was strong enough to preserve for the lower
classes their hitherto undisputed right of receiving such education as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550"></a>[550]</span>
circumstances placed within their reach. I need not pause to comment
on the light which such a passage of history sheds on the
supposed solicitude of monks and clergy to check the spread of
learning for the furtherance of selfish ends. But it is clear that the
permission formally granted by this statute would have been a simple
mockery, unless schools existed adapted to the class in question;
and it may satisfy us of the fact that village schools, in Chaucer’s
time, were really frequented by much the same class of scholars as
in our own; and that not merely in special and more populated
localities, but in remote rural districts. William Caxton, who was born
about the time of the passing of this statute, tells us that he learned
his English in the Weald of Kent, a tract of country which, fertile as
it now is, was, even a century later than Caxton’s time, a waste
wilderness, thinly inhabited, save by herds of deer and hogs, and a
few adventurous men who undertook to clear the forest and break
up the land with the plough.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Yet in this wild country Caxton
learnt his English, “a broad and rude English, as is anywhere spoken
in England.” And in after-life, apologising to his readers for the
plain unadorned style which his “simple cunning” uses, he speaks
of his early education, “whereof I humbly and heartily thank God,
and am bounden to pray for my father’s and mother’s souls, who in
my youth sent me to school.” His education, we know, was carried
on in London at a later date, but it must have been begun in some
very primitive parochial school of Kent, where his companions could
only have been rustics. The teaching in such schools was, doubtless,
simple enough, but however small may have been the amount of
secular learning acquired by the scholars, all received instruction in
Christian doctrine, and learnt their prayers; the duty of providing
such instruction for the poorer members of their flocks being
earnestly pressed on the parish priests in the visitation articles and
synodal decrees of John of Peckham and other English prelates.</p>

<p>Prayers and instructions, both secular and religious, were often
taught to those who could not read, in a versified form, as had been
the custom in Saxon times. Thus there is a curious poem of this
period addressed to “Those who gete their lyvynge by the onest
craft of masonry,” in which the young mason is instructed, rather
minutely, how to behave himself when he comes to the house of
God. Wherever he works, he is to come to Mass when he hears
the bell. Before entering church he must take holy water, and is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551"></a>[551]</span>
understand that in doing so devoutly, he quenches venial sin. Then
he must put back his hood, that is, uncover his head, and as he
enters the church, look to the great Rood, and kneeling down on
both knees “pull up his herte to Christe anon!” He must stand
and bless himself at the Gospel, and avoid carelessly leaning against
the wall; and when he hears the bell ring for the “holy sakerynge,”&mdash;</p>

<p>Versified instructions of this kind were capable of being remembered
by many who never learnt to read, and were evidently in very
common use. We find them in all languages and on all subjects.
Thus the old French treatise entitled “<cite>Stans puer ad mensam</cite>,”
selected by Caxton for one of his translations, and another called
“<cite>Les contenances de la table</cite>,” which exists in a great variety of forms,
give excellent rules for behaving at table and saying grace:&mdash;</p>

<p>Teaching of some sort the peasantry certainly received, whatever
means may have been used to convey it; they probably knew little of
grammatical analysis, or the relative lengths of the European rivers,
but it may be doubted whether, with all our cumbrous machinery
of State education, we have hit on any system which is likely to form
the Christian character so successfully in the hearts of our people
as that which existed in the days of St. Anselm or Chaucer. “The
majority of husbandmen are saved,” writes the former, “because
they live with simplicity, and feed the people of God with their hands;
and therefore they are blessed.”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> And the poet who never paints a

by some means received a thoroughly Christian education, even though
he may never have learnt to read or write, and were wholly innocent
of grammar?</p>

<p>I must not be tempted to enter on the endless theme of school
sports and customs. But it is proper to mention that English schoolboys
had their patron saints, of whom St. Gregory the Great was one.
So we learn from the&mdash;shall I call it poetry?&mdash;of the Puritan, Barnaby
Googe, who tells us that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">St. Gregory lookes to little boyes to teach their a, b, c,</div>

<p class="noindent">On his feast the boys were called into school by certain songs;
presents were distributed, to make them love their school, and one
of their number was made to represent the bishop. But a yet more
universally acknowledged patron was St. Nicholas of Myra, in honour
of whom schoolboys of all ranks and conditions elected their boy-bishop,
and played pranks in which jest and earnest were strangely
blended together. The “childe bishope” preached a sermon, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553"></a>[553]</span>
afterwards received welcome offerings of pence. And this custom
was one of those to which the people clung with the greatest tenacity,
so that it continued to survive down to the close of Elizabeth’s reign.</p>

<p>The character of the studies followed at this time in the higher
English academies, may perhaps be best gathered from an examination
of the kind of learning displayed by the poet already so often
quoted. If Chaucer is to be taken as in any way a fair representative
of an educated Englishman of his time, it is plain that there was,
in a certain sense, no want of learning in the English schools, though
his critics acknowledged that however varied and extensive his reading
may have been, it was loose and inaccurate. In this respect the
English were far behind the Italians. I am not aware that Dante
has ever been convicted of a blunder in his classical allusions, but in
Chaucer such solecisms abound. “All through the poem,” says
Craik, in his critical examination of the <em>House of Fame</em>, “there
runs the spirit of the strange, barbarous, classical scholarship of the
Middle Ages. The Æneid is not wholly unknown to the author, but
it may be questioned if his actual acquaintance with the work extended
much beyond the opening lines. An abridgment, indeed, of the
story of Æneas follows, but that might have been got at second-hand.
The same mixture of the Gothic and the classic occurs throughout
that is found in all the poetry of the period, whether French, English,
or Italian.” He proceeds to quote lines, in which “the harper <em>Orion</em>”
is made to do duty for <em>Arion</em>; Mount Cithæron is supposed to figure
as the individual “Dan Citherus;” the musician Marsyas, who was
flayed alive, appears as “Mersia, that lost <em>her</em> skin,” and so on. However,
it is agreed that Chaucer was, in a certain inaccurate way,
familiar with the stories of the Latin classics, and possessed of whatever
learning was to be acquired in the schools of London and the
universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris, in all of which, according
to Leland, he had “gained great glory.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> At the universities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554"></a>[554]</span>
moreover he had learned men for his cronies; his two most familiar
college friends were John Gower and Randolph Strode, both of whom,
like himself, afterwards attained poetic fame. It is to them that he
dedicated his <cite>Troilus and Creseide</cite>, addressing them as “the philosophical
Strode” and “the moral Gower.” The name of Gower is
too well known to require any comment, but all readers may not be
equally familiar with that of Strode, so we will briefly state that he
was a Scotchman by birth, a fellow of Merton, afterwards a pilgrim
to the Holy Land, and the author of a poem in the vernacular,
entitled “Phantasma,” which critics scruple not to place on a level
with Chaucer’s verse. He finally entered the Dominican Order, and
greatly distinguished himself in the controversy against Wickliffe,
thereby earning the distinguished honour of some very coarse abuse
from the pen of Bale.</p>

<p>Chaucer was educated for the law, and Speght records the doubtful
tradition that he was at one time a member of the Inner Temple, at
which period of his career he is said to have been fined two shillings
for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet Street. At any rate, his
education was that of a “clerk,” and the office he eventually filled
under the Crown was that of Comptroller of the Customs and Subsidies
of wool, skins, and tanned hides in the port of London&mdash;an
office about as suitable to him as that of gauger was to Robert Burns.
He seems to have felt its incongruity with a poet’s sensitiveness, and
its necessary “reckonings” are often alluded to in his verses as sad
trials of patience. He was perfectly at home in the French tongue,
and his familiarity with Italian is stoutly maintained by some, and as
vehemently denied by others. Lydgate says that he translated Dante,
but no fragment of such a work is known to exist. He was an
incessant reader, as he is never weary of letting us know. When he
had done his “reckonings,” his manner was to go home to his house
and sit at his books, “as dumb as any stone,” and read till he was
half blind. Once, he tells us, he spent a whole day reading Cicero’s
<cite>Somnium Scipionis</cite>, from the Commentary of Macrobius. He had a
great liking for old books, and expresses it sweetly enough&mdash;</p>

<p>He seems to have had a decided taste for mathematical and
scientific pursuits. The writings and example of Roger Bacon had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555"></a>[555]</span>
given a great stimulus to these pursuits in England, and Hallam
mentions the names of several Englishmen of the fourteenth century
who distinguished themselves as mathematicians, such as Archbishop
Bradwardine, the profound Doctor, as he was called. Among
Chaucer’s prose works is a Treatise on the Astrolabe, written for
the instruction of his youngest son, Lewis, who was studying at
Oxford under a tutor. He dedicates the work to his boy in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lytel Lewis, my sonne, I perceive well by certaine evidences
thine abilitie to learne sciences touching numbers and proportions,
and also wel consider I thy busie prayer in especiall to learne the
Treatise of the Astrolabie ... therefore I have given thee a
sufficient Astrolabie for an orizont, compounded after the latitude of
Oxenford.” He has compiled it, he adds, because the charts of the
Astrolabe that he has seen were “too hard for thy tender age of ten
yeares to conceive,” and he has written it in English, “for Latine
ne canst thou nat yet but smal, my lytel sonne.”</p>

<p>In one of his poems he gives an exposition of the theory of gravitation,
and appeals to Aristotle and “Dan Plato” in confirmation of
his philosophy. He also explains the propagation of sound, which
he declares to be produced by a series of undulations of air like
those that appear when you throw a stone into the water. He was
familiar with the jargon of the astrologers and alchemists, and his
commentators assure us that he displays a very considerable knowledge
of the real science of chemistry as well as of its quackery,
which last does not escape his lash. For quacks of all sorts indeed
he has no indulgence, and spends his humour on the doctor of
physic, whom he describes as “well grounded in astronomy,” able
to help his patients by his knowledge of magic, no great reader of
his Bible, which was not a very fashionable study with the followers
of Averrhoes and Avicenna, but on excellent terms with his apothecary,
and ready to help him to get rid of plenty of drugs and
electuaries. It will be remembered that at the time when Chaucer
wrote, the “Doctor of Physic,” though a graduate of the universities,
and a very important person in his way, had no great claims to the
character of a man of science. John Gaddesden, a fellow of Merton,
and court physician to Edward, wrote a book called the “Rosa
Anglica,” on his great and successful method of treating patients for
the smallpox, which consisted in hanging their rooms and enveloping
their persons in <em>scarlet cloth</em>! He informs us that, with the blessing
of God, he purposes writing another book on Chiromancy, or fortune-telling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556"></a>[556]</span>
by the hand, condescends to give directions to the court
ladies for preparing their perfumes, washes, and hair-dyes, and
interlards his quack recipes with scraps of original verse.</p>

<p>In his treatment of religious subjects Chaucer represents the tone
of feeling which prevailed among a very large class of Englishmen
in his day. He was a political partisan of John of Gaunt, and therefore
gave the Lollards a certain kind of support. To a man of free
life and coarse humour it was both tempting and easy to exercise
his wit on fat monks and lazy friars, and to grumble like a true
Englishman at their demands on his purse. Doubtless there were
plenty of unworthy representatives of both professions to stand as
the originals of his poetical caricatures, and broadly enough did he
paint their unseemly features. But that was all; and his biographer,
Godwin, admits that, so far from sharing any of the heretical opinions
of the Lollards, his poems unmistakably prove his adherence to the
Catholic dogmas, especially those which they most malignantly attacked,
namely, the Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist;
while his devotion to the Blessed Virgin is expressed in a thousand
passages, such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Contemporary with Chaucer, the father of our poetry, was Sir
John Mandeville, who commonly enjoys the credit of being the
father of English prose, and whose travels let into the popular mind
a glimmering light as to the whereabouts of Tartary, Persia, Armenia,
Lybia, Chaldea, and Ethiopia, all which he visited, besides some
Eastern lands that he calls by the name of “Amazoyn,” “Ind the
Less and the More,” and “many isles that be abouten Ind.” In his
“Itinerary” he describes his visit to Jerusalem and the Holy Land,
apologising for possible inaccuracies by reminding the indulgent
reader that “thynges passed out of long time from a man’s mynd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557"></a>[557]</span>
turnen soon into forgetting; because that the mynd of man ne may
not be comprehended ne withholden for the freelty of mankind.”
The “Itinerary” was written in Latin, and translated by the author
first into French, and from thence into English, and enjoyed great
popularity. And the publication of these travels, together with
those of Marco Polo, stimulated an interest in the study of geography,
so that we begin to find more frequent mention in the catalogues of
monastic libraries of maps and charts. The whole science of map-drawing,
it may be observed, had developed in the cloister; the
German monks showing themselves indefatigable in improving this
branch of science. About the year 1370 Prior Nicholas Hereford
of Evesham Abbey, after collecting a fine assortment of books,
caused a great map of the world to be executed, at the cost of six
marks, for the use of his convent. And a certain Camaldolese monk,
named Fra Mauro, made use of the information derived from the
writings of Marco Polo, and produced a grand Mappamondo, wherein
he depicts the sea rolling round the southern extremity of Africa.
On the margin of his map appear some learned notes, referring the
phenomena of the tides to the moon’s attraction&mdash;a piece of natural
philosophy, however, which, as we have seen, was not unknown to
Bede.</p>

<p>It has been already said that during the reign of Edward III. the
English universities had to sustain the twofold attack of Lollardism
and the Black Death, by the united effects of which they were reduced
to so low a condition, as at one time to have ceased to be regarded
as seats of learning. Nine tenths of the English clergy are said to
have been swept away by the terrible plague, together with the
population of entire cities, and the necessity of the case obliged the
bishops to fill the vacant benefices with men of inferior education, a
practice which for the moment told severely on the state of the
schools. But the effects of the pestilence were less fatally disastrous
than those caused by the heresy of Wickliffe. When in 1361, that
celebrated man, then master of Baliol College, Oxford, first made
himself notorious by his attacks on the mendicant orders, he seems
to have done little more than repeat the old threadbare calumnies
of William de St. Amour and Richard Fitz Ralph. His views were
of course exceedingly relished by the secular doctors, and his <ins class="corr" id="tn557" title="Transcriber’s Note—“teputed talents induced the primate” changed to “reputed talents induced the primate”.">reputed talents induced the primate</ins>,
Simon Islip, to offer him the wardenship
of Canterbury Hall, then newly founded, partly for secular and
partly for monastic students. In order to make room for him, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558"></a>[558]</span>
former warden, Woodhal, a Canterbury monk, had to retire, and
three other monastic students who held scholarships in the college
were at the same time removed. Langham, the successor of Islip,
pronounced these proceedings irregular, and restored Woodhal to
his post. The matter was referred to the decision of Pope Urban
V., who decided in favour of Woodhal, and from that day Wickliffe
became the deadly enemy of the papal power. The university, or
rather the secular regents of the university, immediately took part
with him against the Pope and the Friars, and in 1372, to mark
their adherence to his cause, elected him Professor of Divinity. He
succeeded, moreover, in obtaining the powerful support of John of
Gaunt, and on occasion of a congress, held at Bruges, to settle
various points in dispute between the English Government and the
Holy See, the name of John Wickliffe appears in the list of Royal
Commissioners. All this time there had been no whisper of heresy,
nor was it until after his return to England, when he was promoted
to a prebend in the collegiate church of Westbury, and a little later
was presented by John of Gaunt to the rectory of Lutterworth, that
he began to disseminate his pernicious doctrines. Besides his
peculiar views regarding the possession of property, he had started
views on the subject of predestination, analogous to those afterwards
embraced by Calvin, and attacked the supremacy of the Pope, and
the doctrines of penance, indulgences, the worship of the saints and
of holy images, and prayer for the dead. He and his followers
propagated their opinions by a sort of popular preaching suited to
the tastes of the common people, and accompanied by a certain low
buffoonery, in all ages specially attractive to rude audiences of the
Anglo-Saxon race. The coarse invectives levelled against the clergy
found eager reception among such hearers; for there is perhaps
to most men an irresistible fascination in doctrines which aim at
bringing down any dominant class of society to a lower level. The
English commons were at this period seething in a chronic state of
insurrection, and the Lollard denunciations of the priests and land-holders
were extremely to the taste of the Socialists of the fourteenth
century. It is therefore quite easy to understand how it was that
Hob Miller and Colin Lout should have thought it an excellent
joke to ridicule and despise their betters; but that Wickliffe should
have found warm supporters in the university of Oxford is a fact that
may well surprise and startle us. But Lollardism had a double
aspect, its theological heresies were at first as little relished at Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559"></a>[559]</span>
as at Rome, but its enmity to the religious orders happened to chime
in with the views of the secular faction, and therefore they gave it
their support. An appeal had already been made, not to Rome, but
to Parliament, for a law to prohibit any member of the university
joining a religious order before his eighteenth year, and the Oxonian
divines were not ashamed to accept, together with the desired statute,
a prohibition to carry the matter to Rome. They next established
the rule that no religious, whether monk or friar, should be admitted
to graduate in arts, while at the same time, by the university statutes,
no one could fill a theological professorship without so graduating.
The monks appealed to the Holy See, and obtained a dispensation
from this unjust law, and thus increased the ill-will of their thwarted
and malicious adversaries. The struggle was at its height when
Wickliffe raised his cry against the mendicant orders, whom he
declared to be Antichrist, and proctors of Satan; and he at once
found plenty of grave divines who were willing to regard him as a
useful ally, and forgive both his heresies and his nonsense for the
support he furnished to their side of the quarrel. Hence, in 1377,
when Gregory XI. sent Bulls to the Archbishop of Canterbury the
Bishop of London, and the university of Oxford, calling on them to
take active measures for the condemnation of the heresiarch, we are
assured by Walsingham that the heads of the university deliberated
whether or no they should receive the Bull, nor does it appear
certain that it ever was received. At last, however, in 1381, Wickliffe
startled even his Oxford allies by his attack on the doctrine of the
Holy Eucharist, and a decree was drawn up, and signed by William
de Burton, the chancellor, and twelve of the chief divines, condemning
his errors, and forbidding them to be promulgated in the university.
Hereupon Wickliffe scrupled not to appeal to the Crown and Parliament,
but the English people were not yet quite prepared for such a
step, and the act caused general scandal. Even John of Gaunt, who
had hitherto, from political motives, given him his countenance, now
withdrew his protection, and declared his teaching on the Sacrament
of the Altar to be a “doctrine of devils.”</p>

<p>Oxford, however, had not yet entirely given up his cause. In
1382, when Courtenay, Archbishop of Canterbury, set on foot
vigorous measures for the eradication of the new heresies, he met
with stout resistance from Rigge, who had succeeded De Burton in the
office of chancellor of the university, and who flatly refused to silence
a Lollard professor. Courtenay at last obtained a royal mandate, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560"></a>[560]</span>
virtue of which Wickliffe and his most obstinate adherents were
expelled the university, a good number of professors purchasing
immunity, however by a ready recantation of their errors, for few
evinced any desire of becoming martyrs in the cause.</p>

<p>The steps taken by Courtenay vindicated the authority of the
Church but they were far from being sufficient to purge the university
from the heretical leaven, or remedy the evils caused by these
internal troubles. So far is Ayliffe’s statement that the Wickliffites
restored sound learning at Oxford, from possessing a shadow of truth,
that the period when this heresy was rampant among her doctors
was precisely that when her schools had confessedly sunk to their
very lowest state of decay. The authorities were themselves perfectly
aware of the fact, and represented it as one of the unhappy effects
produced by papal provisions. But the statutes of Provisors, passed
in the reign of Edward III., by which all such provisions were forbidden
under severe penalties, instead of applying a remedy to this
evil, only hastened the decline of learning. It was found that the
Crown was far less disposed to promote men of learning than the
Popes had been; and, to quote the words of Lingard, “experience
showed that the statutes in question operated to the depression of
learning and the deterioration of the universities.” Accordingly in
the year 1399 petitions were presented to Convocation from Oxford
and Cambridge, setting forth that <em>while the Popes were permitted to
bestow benefices by provision, the preference had always been given to
men of talent and industry</em>, and that the effect of such preference
had been to quicken the application and increase the number of the
students; but that since the passing of the Act against Provisors,
their members had been neglected by the patrons of livings, the
<em>students had disappeared</em>, and the schools were nearly abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
Sixteen years later the House of Commons awoke to a sense of the
suicidal character of their own policy, and petitioned King Henry
V. that, <em>to save the universities from destruction</em>, he would suffer the
statutes against Provisors to be repealed. The King referred the
matter to the bishops, who, however, had no wish at all to interfere
with the existing legislation, and contented themselves with passing
a law in convocation obliging every patron of a benefice for the next
ten years to present a graduate of one of the universities.</p>

<p>These facts may serve as sufficient reply to the vaunted “restoration
of learning” achieved by the Lollards. The effect of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561"></a>[561]</span>
influence in the universities, coupled with that of an anti-Roman
course of legislation, had been to bring those institutions to the very
verge of ruin, and that in spite of the extraordinary efforts which
were being made by private munificence to enlarge and perfect the
collegiate system of education. Indeed, though Wickliffe himself
was a man of undoubted ability, the attempt to convert him into a
restorer of humane letters, savours of the absurd.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> His learning
was precisely the same which, when found in the possession of friars
and other scholastics, earns for them such bitter taunts and gibes as
“locusts,” who devoured all the green things in the land, and darkened
it with bad Latin and captious logic. Wickliffe’s Latin was not better
than that of his adversaries, and his logic was of that true Oxonian
temper which Wood qualifies as “frivolous sophistry whereby scholars
could at any time be for or against anything proposed.” The well-known
ballad in which an Oxford student puzzles his simple-minded
parent by proving a pigeon and an eel pie to be convertible terms,
seems hardly a caricature when we read the shifts, or, as Wood terms
them, the “screws” by which the Lollard chief sought to prove that
he meant the precise contrary of what he had been convicted of
saying. “He so qualified his doctrines with conditions,” says
Lingard, “and explained them away by distinctions, as to give an
appearance of innocence to tenets the most mischievous. On the
subject of the Holy Eucharist he intrenched himself behind unintelligible
distinctions, the meaning of which it would have puzzled
the most acute logician to detect.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> And Rohrbacher observes that
instead of appealing to the Scriptures explained by the Fathers, he
took refuge in “arguments and dialectic subtleties, wrapped up in
an obscure and barbarous phraseology;” in other words, he exhibited
precisely the same description of learning, the display of which has
earned so many hard epithets for the academic “locusts.”</p>

<p>Wickliffe’s literary fame rests chiefly on his translation of the Bible
into the vulgar tongue, often incorrectly spoken of as the earliest
English version. It is not clear that he himself ever translated more
than the Gospels, for of the various manuscripts which bear his name,
some are now admitted to have been the production of later Lollard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562"></a>[562]</span>
writers. His English is declared by Mr. Craik to be “coarse and
slovenly,” and far more harsh and obscure than that of Mandeville
or Chaucer. His version was made the vehicle for conveying his
peculiar tenets, by means of corruptions of the Sacred Text, and
was accompanied by certain Prologues or Glosses, explaining it in
an heretical sense. On this account it was enacted by Archbishop
Arundel, in a Provincial Synod held in 1408, that “no one should
hereafter translate any text of Holy Scripture into English by way
of a book, and that no such book, <em>composed lately, in the time of
Wickliffe, or since his death</em>, shall be read.” This decree has been
erroneously interpreted as a prohibition to the laity to read the
Scriptures. But its real meaning is very clearly explained by the
Canonist Lyndwood,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> a contemporary of Arundel’s, as being, first, a
prohibition to any private person to translate the Scriptures into
English without authority; and secondly, a prohibition to use or
read any such unauthorised and incorrect versions. And he expressly
adds that from the terms “newly composed, in the time of
Wickliffe, or since his death,” it is evident that the Lollard versions
only are prohibited, but that every one is still at liberty to read those
formerly translated from the text of Scripture into English or any
other modern idiom. Lyndwood died in 1446, and was living when
the decree in question was first published. His testimony as to its
meaning as then understood and interpreted, as well as to the fact
that other earlier versions did exist at that time, cannot therefore be
called in question. Moreover, Fox the Protestant martyrologist,
tells us, on the authority of Polydore Vergil, that this same Archbishop
Arundel, who is so often accused of prohibiting the reading
of the Scriptures, preached the funeral sermon of Queen Anne of
Bohemia, and mentioned among other things in her praise that she
was a diligent reader of the Four Gospels written in Bohemian, English,
and Latin, with divers expositions, which book she had sent to
him to be viewed and examined.</p>

<p>If this account be correct, it equally vindicates Arundel from the
charge of prohibiting the Scriptures, and Queen Anne from that of
Lollardism on the ground of reading them, for it will be observed
the copy she used had been first submitted to the archbishop’s
approval, and his formal permission had been obtained. We have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563"></a>[563]</span>
also another interesting testimony to the existence of these earlier
versions, and an explanation of the decree against those of the
Lollards, in the words of Sir Thomas More, who, in his Dialogue,
notices the prohibitory Constitution of Arundel in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ye shall understand that the great arch-heretic, Wickliffe (whereas
the Holy Bible was long before his time by virtuous and well-learned
men translated into the English tongue, and by good and godly
people, with devotion and soberness, well and reverently read) took
upon him, of a malicious purpose, to translate it anew. In which
translation he purposely corrupted the Holy Text, maliciously planting
therein such words as might in the reader’s ears serve to the
proof of such heresies as he went about to sow; which he not only
set forth in his own translation of the Bible, but also in certain
prologues or glosses, which he made hereupon. So that after it
was perceived what harm the people took by the translations, prologues,
and glosses of Wickliffe’s, and also of some others who after
him helped to set forth his sect, then, for that cause, it was at a
council holden at Oxford provided, upon great pain, that no man
should henceforth translate the Scriptures into the English tongue
<em>upon his own authority</em> by way of book or treatise, nor no man should
read such books as were newly made in the time of Wickliffe, or
since, or that should be made any time after, <em>till the same translation
were by the Diocesan or Provincial Council approved</em>. But that it
neither forbade the translations to be read that were already well done
of old before Wickliffe’s time, nor condemned his because it was <em>new</em>,
but because it was <em>naught</em>, nor prohibited new to be made, but only
provided that they shall not be read if they be made amiss, till by
good examination they be amended; except they be such translations
as those of Wickliffe and Tindal, which the malicious mind of
the translator hath so handled that it were lost labour to go about to
mend them.”</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he has seen, and, if necessary, could show,
copies of English Bibles, “fair and old,” approved by the Diocesans,
which have been left with lay men and women, and used by Catholic
folk with soberness and devotion, and that the clergy never kept any
Bibles from the laity save those that were “naught,” and not so
approved; that is, those in which heretical corruptions of the text
had been introduced, or to which were attached the pernicious
Lollard glosses. And he explains how it was that no printer had yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564"></a>[564]</span>
ventured to print an English Bible, a great and expensive undertaking,
which might, after all, have been unsaleable, through the question
which might have been raised whether it were printed from a version
made before or since the days of Wickliffe. The whole passage is
sufficiently explicit, both as to the fact of approved English versions
of the Scriptures existing before the time of Wickliffe, and also as to
the received interpretation of Arundel’s decree. We have the very
explicit testimony of Cranmer to the same effect. “It is not much
above a hundred years,” he writes, “since Scripture hath not been
accustomed to be read in the vulgar tongue within this realm; many
hundred years before that it was translated and read in the Saxon
tongue, and when that language waxed old and out of common usage,
because folks should not lack the fruit of reading it, it was translated
again into the newer language.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> It is, however, by no means easy
in all cases to distinguish these early versions from their later
imitations. All the translations of the Scriptures preserved in
manuscript in the Oxford libraries have been commonly assigned to
Wickliffe, although Dr. Thomas James is of opinion that a close
examination of some of them would show them to be of much more
ancient date. He is also disposed to think that one of the prologues
ordinarily assigned to one of Wickliffe’s disciples belongs to an earlier
translation. Lewis, in his “History of the English Translations of
the Bible,” supposes this prologue to have been written in 1396 by
John Purvey, one of Wickliffe’s most learned followers; but its
allusions to the care taken to consult St. Jerome, and the gloss of
Nicholas de Lyra, do not seem to harmonise very well with this theory.
Dr. James considers that the copies preserved in the Bodleian
Library, and in Christ Church Library, are of ancient Catholic
versions, that in Queen’s College Library alone being properly
assigned to Wickliffe. Lewis opposes this view, yet he admits that
the Bodleian and Queen’s College versions are different from that of
Christ Church. Warton claims one of these for John of Trevisa,
and Weever assigns one to the Venerable Richard of Hampole, an
Austin hermit, who lived about the year 1349, near the Monastery
of Hampole in Yorkshire, and, according to Camden, wrote many
books full of “heavenly unction,” and whose translation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565"></a>[565]</span>
Psalter is still preserved. Whatever may be the real history of these
three versions (and it is evident that critics are by no means unanimous
as to their authorship), several fragments exist of different
books of Scripture which are admitted to be of ancient date. In the
library of Bennet College, Cambridge, a translation is preserved of
two of the Gospels and St. Paul’s Epistles, with a gloss, written in
the English spoken after the Conquest. In Sydney Sussex College
are portions of the Old Testament commented on in like manner.
A translation of the Psalter, with a gloss, is in the Harleian Library,
besides the Psalter of Richard of Hampole, mentioned above, to
which is prefixed a prologue, in which the author explains that he
has sought no strange English, but only that which was commonest
and easiest, and has been careful to consult the holy doctors. There
are also, according to Lewis, other translations extant of the Psalter,
the New Testament, and the Church Lessons and Hymns, all made
before the time of Wickliffe. It must be borne in mind that the
manuscripts preserved in our libraries are mere fragments accidentally
saved from destruction, and can scarcely be taken as evidence of
what existed in England before the Reformation. The pious visitors
of Edward VI., in their zeal to purify the university of Popish
service books, destroyed every manuscript they could lay hands on,
which exhibited illuminations or other ornaments, without the slightest
reference to its contents. Whole libraries were then sold for waste
paper, and bought by bakers to feed their ovens, or for other base
purposes. But among the scanty relics that escaped the hands of
these worse than Vandals, stray leaves are to be found of sermons,
treatises, and mutilated hymns, many of which are in the vernacular
English of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. One of these
interesting fragments has been printed by Messrs Wright and
Halliwell in the <cite>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</cite>, and is assigned by them to the
fourteenth century. The preacher appears to have been familiar
with some English version of the Canticle of Canticles, and introduces
a passage which may be quoted as a beautiful specimen of our ancient
English idiom:&mdash;“Behold my derlyng speketh to me; arys, come
nerre my beautiful, now wynter is passid; that is, the coulde wynd
of worldly covertise that mad me hard y-froze as yse: the floures
scheweth them on erth, the voys of the tortel is herd in our herber;
that is, the soule that the kyng of heven has y-lad to his vyne celler,
syngeth chast songes of mornyng for hir sinnes and for deth of Christ
hir mate: she will no more sette on grene bows lovynge worldlye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566"></a>[566]</span>
things, bote fedeth hir with love of Christ, the clene white corne,
and fleeth up to the holes of His five woundes, lookyng with sympel
eyne into the cler waters of holie writ.”</p>

<p>From what has been said, it may be gathered that before the time
of Wickliffe, the Scriptures were in no sense shut up from the laity;
that considerable portions of them were rendered into English, and
are known to have been actually in the possession of lay persons, and
that it was not until the corrupt versions and glosses of the Lollards
were made instruments of disseminating pernicious errors, that any
decrees were made on the subject. Even then the restrictions were
not prohibitions: the laity were still allowed to read approved
Catholic versions: though it is very probable, that at a time when so
large a portion of the population was infected with Lollardism, and
when there was a disposition to make the Sacred Text, interpreted by
each man’s whim, the rule of each man’s belief, the private reading of
the English Scriptures by lay persons was not greatly encouraged.
In fact, prohibitions or restrictions of this sort were never promulgated
by the ecclesiastical authorities, until rendered necessary by
the perverse misuse of the Sacred Volume by heretics. Thus, in
France no such restrictions existed until 1229 when the extravagant
doctrines which the Albigenses pretended to adduce from
Scripture, obliged the Council of Toulouse to forbid the translation
of the Sacred Books, the use of which had, up to that time,
been freely permitted. In no case was the <em>Latin</em> Bible withdrawn
from the laity,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and it must be remembered that in those days the
majority of those who could read at all, could read Latin. Lewis,
indeed, would have us believe that before Wickliffe’s time, even the
Latin Bible was not allowed in common use; and gravely assures
us, that the monks and friars collected copies and laid them up in
their libraries, not (as one might suppose) for the obvious purpose
of reading them, but “to imprison them from the curates and secular
priests, and so prevent them from preaching the Word of God to
the people.” Nonsense of this sort is scarcely worth refuting, though
it finds a place in very grave writers, and by certain readers is often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567"></a>[567]</span>
enough believed. Bibles were, of course, comparatively rare and
expensive books, and not within reach of every poor curate’s purse.
But so far from any conspiracy existing to make them rarer, it was
a common devotion among those who possessed such a treasure, to
bequeath it by will to some public church, there to be set up and
chained, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad usum communem</i>. This practice is often supposed
to have originated with the Reformers, and a modern artist has
depicted, with great skill, the grey-haired peasant approaching the
chained Bible set forth by order of his sacred majesty king Edward
VI., and turning over its pages with pious awe. It was, however, a
good thought stolen from the ancients, as there is abundant evidence
to show. Thus, in 1378 a Bible and Concordance were left by will
by Thomas Farnylaw, to be set up and chained in the north aisle of
St. Nicholas’ Church, Newcastle; and in 1385, a Bible and Concordance
were to be found chained in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor.</p>

<p>These Bibles were, of course, copies of the Latin Vulgate, for it is
not pretended that any effort was made to place a version of the
Scriptures, in the vulgar tongue, at the command of the unlettered
laity. The Catholic system of education did not aim at enabling
every poor man to read his Bible, but rather at making him know
his faith. Nevertheless, so true is it that a strong Scriptural element
has always predominated in the teaching of the Church, that the
first attempts to provide the poor with cheap literature of any sort
were called <cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite>, or the Bibles of the poor. They were
rude engravings of Scriptural subjects, or stories of the saints, taken
off carved wooden blocks, and accompanied with texts of Scripture,
or pious verses. These were known as block-books, and were reproduced
at a much cheaper rate than books written out by hand. Of
course they were not Bibles, but they show that even in the age most
tainted by the Lollard heresy, there was a disposition on the part of
Catholic teachers to supply the people with instruction into which a
certain Biblical element had been infused. The block-books were
likewise used to strike off small school manuals of grammar, and a
book of this sort was technically called a “Donatus.” If the grammars
were welcome boons to schoolboys, the Bibles of the poor were
not less convenient for the use of preachers, who could not carry so
cumbrous a volume as a whole Bible into the pulpit, and were often
glad to help their memory by a selection of suitable texts. Specimens
of these block-books are preserved as curiosities by modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568"></a>[568]</span>
bibliopolists, and the contrivance seems to have been the immediate
forerunner of the more important invention of printing. But in
mentioning them we are somewhat departing from the order of time,
as they can hardly be assigned an earlier date than the beginning of
the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class="pfs90">THE RED AND WHITE ROSES.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1386 TO 1494.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> close of the fourteenth century witnessed the establishment in
England of two new schools, the importance of which caused them
to be regarded as models for all subsequent foundations of a similar
kind in this country. These were William of Wykeham’s twin
colleges at Oxford and Winchester the first of which, opened in
1386, may be said to have perfected the collegiate system of our
universities, while the second, which was not completed till seven
years later, laid the foundation of another system, more peculiarly
national&mdash;that of our English public schools. The object of these
two institutions was to furnish a complete course of free education
to two hundred scholars, who were to be led from the lowest class
of grammatical learning, to the highest degrees of the various faculties.
And at the same time that their intellectual training was thus
amply provided for, they were subjected to a strict rule of discipline,
and the religious element of education was given a much larger
development than it had received in any collegiate foundations which
had yet appeared. Chapels had, indeed, in some cases been
attached to colleges before the time of Wykeham, though they do
not seem to have been regarded as any essential portion of such
institutions; but now the choral office and the magnificent celebration
of ecclesiastical rites were provided for with no less scrupulous
care than the advancement of studies; and thus the founder set his
seal to one great principle of the earlier monastic education, namely,
that habits of devotion, and those too of a certain liturgical character,
ought to be infused into the training which is given to the
children of Holy Church. And in many ways these foundations
reflected the spirit of more ancient times, in what regarded discipline.
When the universities began to be frequented in place of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570"></a>[570]</span>
those monastic and cathedral schools, which up to the twelth century
had been the chief academies resorted to by students, clerical or lay,
no provision at all had been made for the government of the
scholars; a fact which sufficiently explains the scandals and disorders
which fill up the early history of Paris and Oxford. Nor need the
want of such provision excite any surprise, if we bear in mind that
the first universities were not institutions, founded at any particular
period according to some sagacious scheme; but that they sprang
up of themselves out of small beginnings, and developed, like the
grain of mustard seed, into a mighty tree. Scholars and professors
came first, and it was not till they had insensibly grown into a population,
and had committed the excesses of which most lawless
populations would be guilty, that authority stepped in with statutes
and decrees, and endeavoured to give shape and method to the
unwieldy mass. The collegiate system, as we have seen, semi-monastic
in its character, and undoubtedly formed in partial imitation
of the religious houses of study, was called into being in order
to struggle with the monster evils which had arisen out of the university
system; it was an attempt to return, in some measure, to the
ancient paths, and to reassert the principle that intellectual education,
when separated from moral and religious training, is no education
at all. Wykeham adopted this principle in all its fulness, and
herein lay the special value of his work. But with an admirable
discretion he contrived so to adapt it to the wants, the feelings, and
the habits of his age, that it assumed the appearance, not of a retrogression
but of an advance: nay more, he managed so thoroughly to
root his system in the English mind that it stood the brunt of many
revolutions, and even in our own day obtains a traditionary kind of
honour, encrusted as our old foundations have become with the
overgrowth of three Protestant centuries.</p>

<p>The Wykehamist colleges were not only the most splendid
academies of learning founded at this time, but they opened the way
to other foundations of a similar description; and a kind of fashion
set in for founding schools and colleges, which, during the reigns of
our Lancastrian kings, multiplied over the land. The alarm excited
by the spread of Lollardism had something to do with this movement,
and it is remarkable that one Oxford college, that of Lincoln, was
founded by a prelate, Richard Fleming, who at an earlier period had
taken part with Wickliffe, but who, thoroughly startled out of his
partisanship, hastened to make amends for his fault by raising what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571"></a>[571]</span>
hoped would become a nursery of learned divines, who should confute
the errors of the wily heresiarch. That Fleming was thoroughly
in earnest in his change of views was manifested at the Council of
Constance, when we find him distinguishing himself by a very able
opposition to the Hussites.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> His kinsman, Robert Fleming, travelled
into Italy, and there studied in the school of the young Guarini.
He was one of the earliest English scholars who took part in the
revival of classical learning, and during his foreign travels collected
great store of books for Lincoln College, some of which he transcribed
and illuminated with his own hand, being in fact a very skilful limner.
He was the author of a Greek and Latin dictionary, as well as of a
Latin poem entitled, “Lucubrationes Tiburtinæ.” In 1438, Chichele,
Archbishop of Canterbury, who had already shown himself a patron of
learning by the erection of a free school at Higham Ferrars, and of
St. Bernard’s College at Oxford for the use of the Cistercian students,
laid the foundation of his noble college of All Souls, most liberally
endowed, and furnished with books, chapel furniture, and every
requisite for the use of the students. And in 1448 William of Waynflete,
Bishop of Winchester, obtained the royal grant empowering
him to erect his college of Magdalene, in which the collegiate system
was more perfectly carried out than in any previous or subsequent
foundation.</p>

<p>Besides these Oxford colleges, those of Eton, and King’s at Cambridge,
owed their foundation to the zeal of Henry VI., being in
avowed imitation of the plan, already adopted by Wykeham, of uniting
a public school to a house of higher studies at the university, thus providing
an entire course of instruction for elder and younger scholars.</p>

<p>Having elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> given a more particular account than space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572"></a>[572]</span>
will here admit of the foundations of Wykeham, Waynflete, and
Henry VI., so important in the history of English education, it will
not be necessary to dwell on them more at length in this place; but
it should be remembered that these, if the most splendid, were very
far from being the only educational institutions of the period. Our
ancient school-system had ramifications which extended into every
grade of society and we are, generally speaking, but little familiar
with the method by which that system was worked, because we are
equally unaccustomed to study the grand system of our ancient
Catholic charities. A class of magnificent foundations formerly
existed in England, of which there only remain such scanty ruins as
escaped the rapacity of Henry VIII. and the Protector, Somerset,
but the multitude and real nature of which is hardly appreciated. I
refer, of course, to the hospitals and collegiate establishments, which
administered a vast revenue, voluntarily made over by private charity,
for the discharge of all the works of mercy.</p>

<p>Some amongst my readers may be able to look back to early days,
whose first associations are blended with the thought of a venerable
pile, which seemed altogether out of proportion in size and magnificence
to the purposes of a simple parish church. On Sunday
afternoons when the psalm has been unusually long, or the preacher
unusually drowsy, their childish fancies have, it may be, been busy,
among the bosses of the fretted roof, speculating as to the possible
meaning of its wondrous embellishments, and perplexed to account
for the fact that they should be summoned week after week to worship
in what had the outward grandeur of a cathedral, whereas the town
or village clustered round the minster walls seemed wholly undeserving
of such a dignity. Attached to the church there is probably a
school, as at Ottery, or Southwell, or Crediton, or Doncaster, or
Shrewsbury; and if tourists come that way to inspect the encaustic
pavement, or to take rubbings of the fine old brasses, and wonder to
find so huge a building in so insignificant a locality, they are content
to receive the information given them by their guide book, that “the
church was once collegiate.” How vast a meaning may be enclosed
in a simple phrase! “The church was once collegiate!” Yes: it
was attached to one of those creations of Catholic piety which did
the work of almshouse, schoolhouse, workhouse, hospital, and parish
church, or rather, which did a great deal more than any or all of
those put together, and did it with a magnificent profuseness of
liberality, which strikes one dumb with astonishment and admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_573"></a>[573]</span>
Thus, the great Lancastrian College at Leicester, known as the
Newark, or College of St. Mary’s the Greater, the remains of which
still cover many acres of ground, was originally founded for a dean,
twelve secular canons, twelve vicars, three clerks, six choristers,
fifty poor men, as many poor women, ten nurses, and other officers
and attendants, all plentifully provided for. It had, according to
Leland, an exceedingly fair “college church, large and fair cloisters,
some pretty houses for the prebendaries in the college area, and
stately walls and gates,” much of all which is still standing.
That of St. Cross at Winchester was founded by Henry de Blois,
Bishop of Winchester, for the maintenance of thirteen poor men, and
the daily feeding of a hundred others, who were to enjoy their loaf
of good wheaten bread, weighing three pounds, their three quarts of
good small beer, and two messes either of fish or flesh, as the day
should require, in the Hundred-mennes-hall; and as the allowance
was more than any ordinary capacity could dispose of at table, the
statutes judiciously permitted them to carry home what they could
not eat. Cardinal Beaufort enlarged this noble foundation by
providing for the maintenance of thirty-five additional brethren, and
appointing three religious sisters to attend the sick, and bestowed on
it the beautiful title of the “Almshouse of Noble Poverty.” Here,
too, we find a grand collegiate church, with a warden, four chaplains,
thirteen clerks, and seven choristers, for whose instruction provision
was made by keeping up a school. Sometimes the school appears
as the chief object of the foundation, as in the College of Ottery St.
Mary’s in Devonshire, which Bishop Grandison erected in 1337, for
a warden, eight prebendaries, ten vicars, a master of music, a grammar-master,
two parish priests, eight secondaries, eight choristers, and two
clerks. Sometimes the corporal and spiritual works of mercy were
blended together, as at the hospital of St. Leonard’s at York, which
maintained a master, thirteen poor brethren, four secular priests,
eight sisters, thirty choristers, two schoolmasters, two hundred and
six bedesmen, and six servitors. The whole was governed by semi-monastic
statutes under the rule of St. Austin. Most of the smaller
hospitals of York had likewise schools attached to them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, as at Beverley and Ripon, the magnificent
collegiate establishments seem principally designed for the celebration
of the divine offices with a splendour which could not be carried out
in parochial churches; and the schools and other charities attached
to these foundations were not the primary idea. The same seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574"></a>[574]</span>
to have been the case in the great college of Stoke-by-Clare, the
statutes of which are so very precise and rigorous as to the quality of
the plain chant to be sung in choir; but here, too, there was a
school in which boys were to be taught “grammar, singing, and good
manners.” The endowments are not always on so sumptuous a
scale as in these last-named colleges; yet often in very remote
villages and rural parishes we find a modest hospital designed for the
support of a few bedesmen of honest life, and a grammar-school,
wherein, as in St. Gabriel’s Hospital at Brough, in Westmoreland,
the chaplain was required to teach grammar and singing to the
children of the place. Thus, too, at Ewelme, in Oxfordshire, De la
Pole and his duchess had founded an almshouse, called God’s House,
wherein a priest was appointed as schoolmaster to teach their
grammar to the children of the Ewelme tenantry; and a very similar
foundation existed at Bentley, in Derbyshire, where the family of
Mountjoy erected a small college for seven old servants of the lordship,
who were to have pasture for seven cows, wood from the lord’s
manor, and a new gown and hood every third year, on condition of
their saying our Lady’s Psalter twice a day for the founder in the
chapel of the hospital. This last item in the constitutions sealed its
fate at the time of the Reformation, and it was abolished, as being
mixed up with “superstitious observances.” In foundations of this
sort, which were exceedingly numerous, the great proprietors educated
the children of their own tenantry at the same time that they provided
for their superannuated servants.</p>

<p>There is much in the character of these ancient institutions that is
suggestive and instructive to ourselves. What a vast machinery,
what an enormous disbursement for, comparatively speaking, small
results! Surely thirteen poor brethren could be fed and clothed
without its being necessary for Dame Isabel Penbridge to found that
great college of Tonge, in Shropshire, with its establishment of clerks,
and chaplains, and choristers, and to supply them with that body of
solemn statutes which regulates their community life and choral
office with the exactness of a religious rule! Turn again to St.
Giles’ Hospital at Norwich, and reckon what endowments it must
have taken<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> to support a master, deacon, and subdeacon, eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575"></a>[575]</span>
chaplains, wearing the habit of St. Austin’s canons, four lay brothers,
and seven choristers, who were to be scholars likewise; together
with four religious sisters, in order to take care of eight infirm folk
and a few poor superannuated priests, and daily to entertain thirteen
non-resident poor at the common table. A liberal foundation, it
may be said, for a few insignificant paupers; but it is clear the
founder had in his mind the celebration of High Mass and the
choral office; and that providing for the celebration of holy rites with
becoming solemnity was reckoned then a good work as pleasing to
God as the feeding of the poor.</p>

<p>Again, in what a beautiful light were the poor themselves regarded.
They were not “paupers,” but “brethren.” They were not kept
alive with water gruel, but fed with meat and ale, and good
“mostrell.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> They were not assigned a narrow bench in a distant
corner of those grand collegiate churches, but often enough had
stalls like so many canons. Such stalls are still to be seen, or at
least were so a few years since, in St. Mary’s Hospital, Chichester,
and, I am glad to say, were still occupied by their lawful owners&mdash;the
thirteen poor brethren. The church was <em>their</em> church; its
numerous staff of clerks and choristers were assembled <ins class="corr" id="tn575" title="Transcriber’s Note—“there to sing the divine offoe” changed to “there to sing the divine office”.">there to sing the divine office</ins> for <em>them</em>; they were honoured, not despised; and
in their turn they felt an honest pride in wearing that reverend garb&mdash;the
black gown or overcoat, with its red, white, or silver cross&mdash;such
as may still be seen in the hospitals of Winchester or Worcester.</p>

<p>And, as to the schools attached to such foundations, what must
have been the effect produced on the mind of the scholars whose
earliest and most abiding lesson was, that nothing was too great or
too good to give to God or the poor! For God, the stately minister,
the magnificent vestments, and the solemn chant, which made up the
daily business of a whole college of priests, clerks, and choristers.</p>

<p>And for the poor, a home in their old age, the care of religious
women in time of sickness, generous maintenance, kindness, honour,
and respect. What a prodigious amount of moral and religious education
was conveyed in schools for the young, annexed to such hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576"></a>[576]</span>
and colleges, wherein the two duties of prayer and almsdeeds made
up a portion of the daily life, and in which the instincts of reverence
must have become a sort of second nature!</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century we find these foundations rapidly multiplying,
and their scholastic character assuming a larger development.
To the masters of grammar and singing is now frequently added a
third for <em>writing</em>; the grammar-master is not unfrequently provided
with an usher, which seems to argue that the scholars were becoming
more numerous, and the salary of the masters is fixed higher than
that of the other priests. In the College of Bradgate in Kent no
chaplain was to be admitted who had not three qualifications&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bene
legere, bene construere, et bene cantare</i>. The great English prelates
had a special love for founding colleges of this description
in the places of their birth. Thus Thomas Scott, Archbishop of
York, founded the college and school of Rotherham; and Kempe,
Archbishop of York, and cardinal, who was a poor husbandman’s son,
converted the parish church of Wye, his native place, into a college
for the education of youth, and for perpetual prayer to be made
therein “for the sowles of them that set hym to schole.” And
Chichele of Canterbury, as has been already said, founded the college
of Higham Ferrars in Northamptonshire. This formerly occupied a
grand quadrangle with two great wings. The schoolhouse, in the
florid style of Gothic architecture, is, I believe, still standing; but the
remainder of the stately and beautiful buildings were a few years
since laid waste by the steward of a noble earl, and the site occupied
by barns and hunting stables. Choral schools appear moreover to
have been attached to the private chapels of great households. Thus
there was a “Maister of the childer” among the officers of the Earl
of Northumberland’s chapel, and the eight children belonging to
King Edward IV.’s chapel had likewise their “Maister” who was to
draw them not only to the study of prictsong, but also to that of
their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facet</i> or grammar, “and suche other vertuous things.” Moreover
his household accounts contain the pay and livery of the “Scholmaster’s
teaching, given in the house.” Besides this choral school
the same king maintained a sort of Palatine Academy at his court,
formed of six or more young gentlemen, or <i lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">henxmen</i>, as they are
called, whose master was to teach them “to read clenely and surely,
to learn them their harness;” and moreover to teach them “<em>sundry
languages</em>, and other vertuous learnings, such as to harp, to pipe,
to sing and to dance, each to be trained to that kind of vertue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577"></a>[577]</span>
that he is most apt to learn, with remembrance dayly of Goddes
Service.”</p>

<p>Another proof of the increasing interest which was being felt in
the work of education, is the occasional transformation of charitable,
into educational, institutions. Reading school was originally one of
those numerous hospitals which the lordly abbots had established in
their town. It was designed for certain poor women serving God
day and night, who prayed for the king’s estate and the soul of the
founder, the good abbot, Hugh. They had a fair chapel for divine
service, bread, meat, and drink from the abbey, and an annual sum
of money and outfit of clothing. The sisters were widows of
respectable persons in the town who had fallen into poverty; they
had a <em>quasi</em> religious character, and the formulary of their admission
included prayer, sprinkling of holy water, the blessing of the veil and
mantle, and the giving of the kiss of peace. In 1446, Abbot Thorne
suppressed this hospice, though as he applied its revenues to the use
of the almoner, we will hope that they were expended in charity.
“On a tyme, however,” says an anonymous and rather discontented
writer, “Kyng Edward IV. cam through Redyng to Woodstock,”
and expressed himself much displeased that “Saint Johny’s House,”
as well as another house for lazars, had been diverted from its
original purpose. He commanded Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury,
to institute a reform, but he was unable to do so, and departed “ful
ylle content.” However, some years later, at the suggestion of
Henry VII., the hospital was re-endowed as “a fre scole,” and
although when the nameless author, above quoted, wrote, there was
as yet “neither scole, nor man, nor woman, nor chyld, relieved there,”
yet in due time the master and usher were appointed, and the school
attained no inconsiderable renown as a place of learning. It is
remarkable that among the privileges of the abbots of Reading was
that of granting school licenses. No one was permitted to open a
school of any description in the town without the approbation of the
Abbot and Convent, who exercised within certain limits the same
authority as a diocesan chancellor.</p>

<p>At Bury, again, the abbots had so early as 1193 founded in the
town a free school for forty poor boys. The building was near the
present shire house whence the street still retains the name of School
Street. This school was still flourishing in the reign of Henry VI.,
for we find a letter addressed by Abbot Curteys, a great friend of
that amiable and scholar-loving king, to Master William Farceaux,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578"></a>[578]</span>
graduate in grammar and arts, and master of the School of Bury.
And not to weary the reader with the enumeration of names and
places, I will only add that all the large abbeys appear to have maintained
not one, but several of these endowed free schools in various
parts of their domains.</p>

<p>The greater variety of seminaries now existing was gradually introducing
a greater separation of classes; hitherto students of all ranks
had mingled under the same master, but now aristocratic distinctions
began to be made. Eton soon became the favourite resort of the
sons of the gentry, though not a few continued to be prepared for
the universities at the monastic schools, especially at Glastonbury
and Pollesworth. The latter was found in an admirable state of
discipline at the time of the suppression, when the commissioners
testified to the fact that the town which had sprung up round the
monastery was almost entirely peopled, by “artifycers, laborers, and
vitellers, that lyve by the said house, and the repayre and resorte that ys
made to the <i lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">gentylmennes children and studiounts</i> that doo ther lif to the
numbre of xxx. or xl. and moo, that ther be right vertuously brought
upp.” At Hyde Abbey eight noble youths were received as students,
who always ate at the abbot’s table. Winchcombe likewise retained
its character for learning, and Abbot Kidderminster, by his wise
government and encouragement of good letters, is said to have made
his school flourish so much that it became equal to a little university.</p>

<p>If we put together the different classes of schools enumerated
above, it will, I think, appear that in the fifteenth century England
was quite as amply provided with the means of education for rich
and poor as she is in the present day. There were, it seems, two
large public schools for the gentry, other schools for the upper
classes attached to monasteries and the larger colleges; monastic
and collegiate schools for the middle classes, and other endowed
free schools of a similar grade, and schools attached to smaller
hospitals, evidently for a yet humbler class, such as the children of
the neighbouring villages, or the tenantry of the founder; and lastly,
there were the priests’ or parish schools, usually governed by a dame.</p>

<p>A more general interest was being felt in the work of education
among all classes, and an attentive study of the household accounts
of noble families of this period will discover among the items of
expenditure a more frequent mention of “pennes,” “ynke,” and
“bokes.” Hallam notices that the Paston letters, all written by
members of a private family during the reigns of Henry VI., Edward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579"></a>[579]</span>
IV., and Richard III., are not only grammatical, but fluent and
elegant in their style, and he remarks that it is a proof how unfairly
we should measure the refinement and education of an age merely
by its published literature. England in the fifteenth century was in too
troublous a state for men to have much leisure for writing books;
and hence though there was evidently an increased relish for literary
pursuits under our Lancastrian princes, we are not surprised to find
few additions to our national literature during this period. Yet some
writers there were, such as the poets Occleve and Lydgate; the
former a disciple of Chaucer, and author of a poem on the education
of princes; whilst Lydgate, the monk of Bury, enjoyed an immense
reputation in his own day, and in ours has been equally undervalued.
He was educated at Oxford, and was a man of varied learning,
familiar with the literature of France and Italy, both which countries
he had visited, a mathematician and a classical scholar, and altogether
well qualified to fill the post of professor in his own abbey.
Here he taught the sons of the nobility “the art of versification,
<em>elegancies</em>, poetry, rhetoric, geometry, astronomy, and theology.” He
was equally esteemed by the pious king Henry VI., who visited him in
his monastic cell, and by the London goldsmiths and citizens, who
employed him in writing verses, and contriving quaint devices for
their May games and city pageants. Of his two hundred and fifty
poems none have been judged worthy to find a place in the various
collections of the British poets, published during the last century.
Halliwell has published a selection of his minor pieces, but his
“Court of Sapience,” a noble poem extending to several hundred
stanzas, remains still in MS., or in the early Caxton editions. The
student of English literature is often perplexed to understand the
principles which appear to have directed the choice of our modern
editors. With the exception of Chaucer and Gower, whose claims
were too great to be disallowed, no ante-reformation poets are
admitted into the collections of Southey or Chalmers, with the
exception of Hawes and Skelton, whose doggerel is tolerated, possibly
on account of its scurrility. Even Occleve, though but a second-rate
versifier, is better than these, but Lydgate’s “Court of Sapience”
is incomparably superior to anything that appeared between the
times of Chaucer and Spenser. Its tone, however, is essentially
Catholic, and even theological, and this, together with the monkish
titles of some of his works, such as <cite>the Lyf of our Ladye, and the
Legende of St. Edmund</cite>, seem to have occasioned his exclusion by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580"></a>[580]</span>
collectors, who have not been ashamed to rake together all the
rubbish, and worse than rubbish, of our Restoration and Georgian
periods. If the ancient religious poetry of this country should ever
find an editor, readers who are accustomed to suppose that intelligible
English dates from the time of Spenser, would be amazed at
the power and pathos possessed by earlier writers. When we examine
such poetical fragments as are still preserved, the wonder perhaps
ceases, that they should have found small favour from modern editors.
For the most part they are devoted to celebrate the glories of the
Blessed Virgin, or the Mysteries of the Passion. The first subject
has, of course, no chance of indulgence from a Protestant public,
and the second is hardly more popular when treated precisely in the
same spirit as it is presented to us in the prayers of St. Bridget, or
the devout productions of antique Christian art. To Catholics, however,
it is a joy and a solace to look back into past centuries, and
remember that there were days when our poets drank of a purer fount
than that of Castaly; and made it their pride to celebrate in their
verse, not Dian, nor Proserpine, but the Immaculate Queen of
Heaven. Of Chaucer’s devotion to this theme I have already
spoken, but other poets before his time delighted in dedicating their
verses to her who, as she has inspired the most exquisite designs of
the artist’s pencil, has also claimed not the least beautiful productions
of the poet’s pen. Thus, one sings of her as “Dame Lyfe,” and describes
how</p>

<p>Another class of poems is dedicated to the sorrows of Mary;

“The Lamentation of the Blessed Virgin,” I extract but two verses,

<p>A great number of the Church hymns and other devotions are
also to be found translated in a versified form for the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583"></a>[583]</span>
laity, such as the <cite>Veni Creator</cite>, the <cite>Popule mi, quid feci?</cite> and other
portions of the Holy Week office. These fragments, which are
mere indications of the rich stores of religious literature possessed
by our ancestors, must not be lost sight of when studying the
subject of popular education. Were we to credit the majority of
writers on ancient manners, the poetry of the Middle Ages was
exclusively furnished by the profane and licentious <em>jongleurs</em>, whose
productions have been very diligently sought out and republished
for the edification of the curious, whilst the very existence of a vast
body of popular religious poetry is systematically ignored. Yet the
one class of writings is surely as characteristic of the age to which
it belongs as the other; and we are bound not to condemn the
morals of our forefathers from the study of that portion of their
literature which is corrupt and reprehensible, without also receiving
the evidence furnished by poetry of a totally opposite description.</p>

<p>We must not conclude our notice of the English writers of the
Lancastrian period without briefly noticing the names of two learned
monks. The first was John Capgrave, author of the <cite>Legenda Sanctorum
Angliæ</cite>, which Leland says was chiefly derived from an earlier
collection of saints’ lives by John of Tynemouth, a monk of St.
Alban’s, who died in 1370. Capgrave also produced other learned
works, a MS. copy of one of which, a commentary on the Book of
Genesis, is preserved in the library of Oriel College, and contains
in its initial letter a portrait of the author presenting his book to
Duke Humphrey, whose autograph is at the end of the volume.
The other religious writer was Walter Hilton, a Carthusian monk of
Shene. His “Scale of Perfection,” an invaluable spiritual treatise,
which formed the favourite study of Sir Thomas More, has been
reprinted, but a considerable number of his other spiritual works
exist in manuscript in the British Museum, and yet await an editor.</p>

<p>If the English did not compose many books at this period, they
bought and transcribed them with great diligence. More books
were copied during the first half of the fifteenth century than during
any previous century and a half. Book collectors were enterprising
enough to take journeys into Italy, and returned laden with literary
treasures; among whom, besides Fleming, already noticed, were
Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, the friend of Pius II.; John Free, a
British ecclesiastic, afterwards Bishop of Worcester; Millyng, Abbot
of Westminster; and Sellynge, Prior of Canterbury; all of whom
had studied the classical literature at Padua, or in Guarini’s Florentine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584"></a>[584]</span>
school. In the household accounts of Sir John Howard, founder
of the house of Norfolk, is a bill for the transcribing, illuminating,
and “flourishing” of books. Enormous sums were spent by literary
dandies on bookbinding. Edward IV. is said to have spent as
much on binding a book as was then the price of an ox, and “caused
thereafter to be delivered to his binder six yards of velvet, ditto of
silk, besides laces, tassels, and gilt nails.” The Lancastrian princes
were all patrons of letters: Henry V., as we know, was a scholar of
Queen’s, though, judging from his life after leaving the university, we
can hardly suppose him to have been at that time much of a reading
man. At a later period, however, he seems to have had literary
tastes, and in order to gratify them he did not always return the
books he borrowed. After his death, petitions were presented from
the Countess of Westmoreland and the Prior of Christchurch, praying
that certain books borrowed of them by the King might be restored.
Those lent by the Prior consisted of the works of St. Gregory. His
son, Henry VI., was the very type of a scholar; whilst his uncle
Beaufort, Cardinal and Bishop of Winchester, and his two brothers,
the Regent, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
were all distinguished as men of learning. Duke Humphrey was
beyond all doubt the most munificent patron of letters that had yet
appeared in England, and did his best to redeem her schools from
the charge of barbarism brought against them by Poggio and the
other classic scholars of Italy. He was a great book collector, and
the copies he caused to be transcribed were all of the most costly
and splendid description, written on vellum and adorned with
illuminations: 129 such manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> were bequeathed by him to
the University of Oxford, of which <em>one</em>, and one alone, remains. All
the others were destroyed by the pious visitors of Edward VI., who
considered that everything that was enriched with illuminations must
be a popish missal, and therefore only fit to be cast to the flames.
The solitary survivor is a copy of <cite>Valerius Maximus</cite>, the index to
which is written by the hand of Humphrey’s dear and learned friend
Whethamstede, Abbot of St. Alban’s.</p>

<p>Humphrey’s patronage was not confined to English scholars.
Heeren prints a Latin epistle, addressed by him to the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585"></a>[585]</span>
Decembrio, who had presented him with a translation of Plato <cite>De
Republica</cite>. He employed several learned French and Italian translators,
and to him Leonard Aretino dedicated his version of Aristotle,
the presentation copy of which is preserved in the Bodleian. Pope
Pius II., in a letter written about the middle of the century, mentions
the fact that the duke had sent into Italy and procured several professors
to explain the Latin poets and orators in his own country.
And Vossius speaks of a certain master from Ferrara, to whom he
gives the name of Titus Livius, and who, he says, came into England
by the invitation of the Duke of Gloucester, and while there wrote
a life of Henry V., and dedicated it to his son Henry VI. This
life has been republished by Heeren. The real name of the author
is unknown, and he probably assumed that of the Latin historian to
indicate that he imitated his style.</p>

<p>Duke Humphrey’s chief assistant, however, in his literary labours
was the learned abbot named above, John Whethamstede of St.
Alban’s. He was originally a monk of Tynemouth, in Northumberland
(which was a cell of St. Alban’s), whence he removed to
Gloucester Abbey; then he was made prior of Gloucester College
at Oxford, in which office he had every opportunity for indulging
his taste for study and his equally characteristic liberality; for he
spent a considerable sum in the erection of a new library, on which
he bestowed many books prefixed with verses, warning off the fingers
of pilferers. He also adorned the college with painted windows, set
up inscriptions under the Crucifix and other holy images, and
poured out so many other benefactions on the house that he was
formally declared to be its second founder.</p>

<p>He was elected Abbot of St. Alban’s for the first time in 1420, and
having resigned his office in 1440, was elected a second time in
1451. It would be no easy matter to catalogue all his good deeds,
for Whethamstede was a great reformer and builder, and setter to
rights of decayed offices. In fact, he united in a very uncommon
degree the literary and the practical gifts, and while busy with his
books and libraries, did not forget the repairing of brew-houses and
enclosing of kitchen gardens; in spite of which services, the monks
very unjustly accused him of neglecting their affairs, and giving all
his time to study. Weever enumerates all the multifarious decorations
in the shape of painted windows, gilded and illuminated verses,
and other ornaments which he set up in his abbey. “Our Lady’s
Chapel,” he says, “was very curiously trimmed and depicted, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586"></a>[586]</span>
letters dispersed therein in gold.” The north part of the abbey
church being somewhat dark, he made it glorious with new windows,
introducing, with taste more classical than suitable, the figures of
such heathen philosophers as had testified of Christ. He also
expended great sums in books for the abbey library, “as well for
the use of the brethren of the cloister as for the scholars;” an
expression which shows that the monastic school was still kept up.
These books exceeded eighty-seven in number, besides which he
caused to be begun the copying of Nicholas de Lyra’s great commentary
on the Bible, and employed Lydgate to translate the metrical
life of St. Alban into English verse. He also added many of his
own compositions, such as his <cite>Granarium</cite>, a sort of theological
commonplace book, in five volumes, dedicated to Duke Humphrey.
The duke was fond of visiting the abbey, to which he was a great
benefactor, and employed Whethamstede in collecting books for him;
and after his death, St. Alban’s was very fitly chosen as the place of
his interment.</p>

<p>We must now for a time leave the company of princes and abbots,
and take our way through the streets of London&mdash;a city which, even
in the days of Henry II., was thickly populated with schoolboys, and
which, thanks to his pious namesake Henry VI., kept up its name
as a place of good learning in the fifteenth century. We have
already seen something of the university and domestic education of
Old England, but we have yet to make ourselves acquainted with the
schools and scholars of the middle class. The English Commons
were at this precise period fast rising in wealth and importance, and
the number among them who sought a good education for their
children was every year on the increase. The London citizens
particularly were men of intelligence and enterprise, fully conscious
of the weighty position they held in the State, and perfectly well
qualified to fill it. Nor let the fastidious reader scorn the idea of
scholarship as associated with that of a community of mercers and
fishmongers; for it is a fact of which England has no cause to be
ashamed, that many of her greatest public men, and not a few of her
best scholars, have risen from the mercantile and working classes.
Lord mayors and aldermen have not unfrequently spent the wealth
they have amassed by trade in foundations of charity or learning.
Thus, Elsing Spittal, at Cripplegate, was founded in 1329, by a
London mercer, for the sustentation of a hundred blind men; St.
Lawrence’s College, in 1332, by Lord Mayor Poulteney; St. Michael’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587"></a>[587]</span>
College, by Sir William Walworth, of Wat Tyler-slaying celebrity;
and Leadenhall College, by Sir Simon Eyre, another lord mayor and
draper, who provided that a school should be attached to his college
under the care of three schoolmasters and an usher. His wishes do
not seem to have been carried out, but in 1446 his beautiful chapel
was given over to the newly-established confraternity of the Holy
Trinity; and some of the priests belonging to this society, says
Stowe, celebrated divine service in this chapel every market day for
the market people.</p>

<p>So again in 1418, William of Sevenoaks, who from a foundling
had made his way to civic honours, built and endowed a college in
his native place, and a free school for the townsmen’s children; and,
not to multiply examples, the renowned Sir Richard Whittington,
mercer and Lord Mayor of London, after founding his noble College
and Hospital of St. Michael’s Royal, and repairing St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, built at his own expense the great library of the Grey
Friars, and expended a considerable sum in furnishing it with reading
pews, and causing to be transcribed a fair copy of Nicholas de Lyra
for the friars’ use. Men of this stamp were solicitous to see their
city provided with good schools, and in 1446 we find a petition
presented to Parliament by four city priests, begging the honourable
Commons to take into consideration the great number of grammar-schools
that had formerly existed in the metropolis, and the fact that
many of them had lately fallen into decay. The petitioners go on to
say that many persons now resort to London to be informed of
grammar, through lack of good schoolmasters in the provinces,
“wherefore it were expedient that in London were a sufficient number
of scholes and good informers in grammar; for where there is gret
number of lerners, and few techers, the maisters wax rich of money,
and the lerners poorer in cunning, agenst all virtue and order of weal
publik.” They entreat therefore that schools may be opened in each
of their parishes, and persons learned in grammar set over them
“there to teach to all that will learn.” In compliance with this
petition, we find the good king Henry VI. founding no fewer than
eight grammar-schools in this and the following year. And Mercers’
School was likewise established in connection with the Mercers’
Company.</p>

<p>Stowe describes the grammatical disputations kept up between
the scholars of these academies even in his time, and lets us know
that the scholars of St. Paul’s were wont to call those of St. Anthony’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588"></a>[588]</span>
“Antonie pigs,” by reason that St. Anthony is usually figured with
a pig following him; and that they in their turn retaliated on their
rivals the sobriquet of “pigeons,” many such birds being wont to make
their haunt in the spire of St. Paul’s church. And it was their
custom when they met one another in the street to provoke one
another to disputation with the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salve tu quoque; placetne
disputare?</i> To which, if the answer were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet</i>, they fell to
words, and soon to blows also, the satchels full of grammars serving
as convenient weapons, which oftentimes bursting in the fray, the
books were scattered about in heaps to the great trouble of the
passers-by. The least admirable thing recorded of the London schoolboys,
however, is their taste for cock-fighting. On Shrove Tuesday
every schoolboy in London brought a cock to his master, and the
whole of that forenoon, says Fitz Stephen, “is spent by them in
seeing the cocks fight in their schoolroom.” No wonder that Colet,
among other retrenchments, prohibited his scholars of St. Paul’s from
taking part in these Shrovetide cock-fightings, as a description of
sport eminently fitted to foster in the boyish nature those brutal
tendencies which are perhaps indigenous to the soil. That a taste
for learning and a generous disposition to encourage it were to be
found among not a few of the London citizens of this period is
sufficiently clear; and among many names that might be given of
founders of schools and lovers of letters, that of John Carpenter,
town clerk of London in the reigns of Henry V. and Henry VI.,
must not be omitted. He was executor to Whittington, and the
personal friend of two at least of those four priests above named who
had petitioned Parliament for the establishment of more schools.
These were Thomas Neel, Master of the Hospital of St. Thomas de
Acon, and Incumbent of St. Mary, Colechurch; and William Lichfield,
Rector of Allhallows the Great. Lichfield was a considerable writer
both in prose and verse, whom Stowe calls “a great student and a
famous preacher.” These two excellent ecclesiastics took part in
many good works with John Carpenter, and probably assisted him in
making that collection of books, afterwards mentioned in his will.
Carpenter seems also to have had a taste for the arts; for the
famous Dance of Death painted in the cloisters of old St. Paul’s,
was placed there at his expense, with accompanying verses from the
pen of Lydgate. It is, however, as an encourager of liberal education
that he claims a place in these pages, and the benefaction by which
he left certain tenements in the city “for finding and bringing up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_589"></a>[589]</span>
four poor men’s children with meat, drink, apparel, and learning, at
the schools in the universities, for ever,” was the foundation which
has since grown into the City of London School.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>But after all, the mind is trained by other things than schools and
pedagogues; and the London apprentice, no less than the university
undergraduate, drew in no small part of his education from the
scenes and daily life that went on around him. Old London, no less
than old Oxford, had a teaching of her own; she was not altogether
that place of smoke and trade and unceasing business which we
think of now when we name “the City:” she had a fairer,&mdash;I had
almost said a poetic&mdash;side, and her old historians grow eloquent when
they describe it. Who would suppose that it is the great Babylon
that Fitz Stephen is speaking of when he praises the picturesque
beauty of the suburbs, “with the citizens’ gardens and orchards
planted with trees tall and sightly, and adjoining together. On the
north side,” he continues, “are pastures and meadows, with brooks
running through them, turning water-mills with a pleasant noise.
Not far off is a great forest and a well-wooded chase, having good
covert for harts, does, boars, and wild bulls. The cornfields are not
of a hungry, sandy mould, but as the fruitful fields of Asia, yielding
plentiful increase, and filling the barns with corn. And there are
near London abundance of wells, sweet, wholesome, and clear, such
as Holy-well, Clerken-well, and St. Clement’s-well, much frequented
by scholars and youth of the city in summer evenings when they walk
forth to take the air.” Stowe likewise speaks of these pleasant walks
in the suburbs, and adds a feature of touching beauty to the picture:&mdash;“Near
a fair field in Houndsditch, belonging to the Prior of the
Holy Trinity, were some cottages and little garden-plots for poor
bed-rid people, built by some prior of that house; and in my youth
I remember devout persons were accustomed, specially on Fridays,
to walk that way to bestow their alms on the poor, who lay in their
beds near the window, that opened low, and on it was spread a fair
linen cloth and a pair of beads, to show that there lay a bed-rid
person unable but to pray only.” Within the walls were 130
churches, besides convents, priories, and hospitals innumerable. In
Westcheap, near the north door of St. Paul’s, stood the great
Crucifix surrounded by figures of saints, where the choristers of St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590"></a>[590]</span>
Paul’s had a goodly exhibition for singing on certain days the responsory,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sancte Deus fortis</i>, and thither on all feasts of St. Paul’s
came the chapter in embroidered vestments and wearing rose garlands
on their heads. This last ornament was very commonly worn
in English processions, specially on the summer festivals of Whit-Sunday
and Corpus Christi, and not only by canons and choristers,
but also by young scholars, as we learn from Matthew Paris. There
were city companies then as now, and there were guilds and confraternities,
which gave to their members “gret commodyte and surety
of lyvyng,” and which recreated the citizens with their gorgeous
processions, while they provided support for their poor brethren
during life, and after death, burial, prayers, and masses. On the
feast of the patron saint, the guild brethren had a dinner, of course,
and generally an interlude or sacred drama; and Fitz Stephen
assures us that the citizens of his time preferred those which were
from sacred subjects, such as the Passion, or the martyrdom of a
saint. Clerkenwell received its name from the Fraternity of Parish
Clerks, who yearly assembled there to play “some large history of
Holy Scripture,” and in the reign of Henry IV. enacted one which
lasted <em>eight days</em>, and was “of matter from the creation of the world.”</p>

<p>But, to use the words of our old historian, “a city should not only
be commodious and serious, but also merry and sportful,” and
London had nothing to blame herself for on this head. During the
Easter holidays there were sham fights on the river, with leaping,
dancing, shooting, and cock-fighting, and great twisted trees were
brought in from the woods to adorn the house of every man of
worship. The great May-pole hung in Westcheap, and on May
morning every citizen went forth early into the country to seek the
May. All through the summer months bonfires were kept up on the
eves of great festivals, and tables set out in the streets with meat and
drink plentifully provided by the wealthy householders, who invited
the neighbours and passers-by to eat and be merry with them with
great familiarity, and so thank God for His benefits. And Rome
herself never witnessed a more graceful celebration of the feasts of
St. John Baptist and the Holy Apostles than that which used to be
held in the streets of London, where “every man’s door was shadowed
with green birch, fennel, and St. John’s-wort, together with white
lilies and such like, and garnished with garlands of beautiful flowers,
among which lamps of glass burnt all the night;”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> while some hung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591"></a>[591]</span>
out huge branches of iron, curiously wrought, whence hung hundreds
of lamps at once, and this was particularly the custom in New Fish-street.
At Christmas, of course, the houses and conduits were decked
with a profusion of evergreens, and the Christmas revels must be
left to the imagination of the reader.</p>

<p>When the holidays were over, came sports and contentions of
another sort. The masters of the different schools held solemn
meetings in the London churches, and their scholars disputed logically,
grammatically, and demonstratively. The disciples of rival
academies “<em>capped</em> or <em>potted</em> verses one with another, nipping and
quipping their fellows with pleasant rhymes, which caused much
laughter.” The poets sometimes addressed their fun and their verses
to their masters, expending their wit in hopes to obtain a holiday.
And, however it may be explained, I find more notices of versifiers
among the London scholars than elsewhere. Indeed, we must fain
suppose that the citizens had a naturally poetic vein when we read of
their gorgeous and fanciful devices. Chaucer tells us that the good
shopkeepers of the Cheap had weary work with their apprentices,
who, when there were any “ridings” or royal entries, would leap
out of the shop, and not return till they had seen all the sight, and
had a good dance into the bargain. And really, when we read how
the fifth Harry rode into London with little birds fluttering round
his helmet, green boughs cast in his way, priests, with gilded
copes, swinging censers, and every street exhibiting a castle,
or a giant, or a legend of some saint, we cannot wonder that it
was sometimes a difficult matter to keep the ’prentices behind the
counter.</p>

<p>Surely too there must have been scholars among the citizens to
devise such scenes as were exhibited at the entry of Henry VI., when
a tabernacle of curious work arose on Cornhill, wherein Dame
Sapience appeared, surrounded by the seven liberal arts; and when
divers wells poured forth goodly wine to the passers-by, appropriately
named the Well of Mercy, of Grace, or of Pity. But, in fact, most
of such pageants were designed by men of letters, and no one was
more frequently called on for this purpose than the monk of Bury.
He was exceedingly popular with the London citizens, and whether a
disguising was intended by the company of goldsmiths, a May game
for the sheriffs, or a carol for the Coronation, it was generally Lydgate
who supplied the poetry. And he, in his turn, loved the citizens,
and ever spoke well of them in his verse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">A testimony to which we must add that delivered two hundred
years earlier by Fitz Stephen. “I do not think,” he says, “that there
is any city to be found wherein are better customs in frequenting the
churches, in serving God, in keeping holidays, in giving alms, in
entertaining strangers, in solemnising marriages, in furnishing
banquets, celebrating funerals, and burying dead bodies.” He adds,
however, that London had some “inconveniences,” such as the
immoderate drinking of some foolish persons, and the frequent fires.</p>

<p>Such then were some of the scenes in the midst of which the
young citizen grew up, and which supplied him with many ideas
beyond those of his shop wares and his reckonings. Sometimes he
passed over to France or Flanders to procure his stores of silks
and velvets, or fine Paris thread; and on such occasions, book collectors,
like Duke Humphrey, or Tiptoft of Worcester, did not
disdain to employ the services of an intelligent merchant to procure
them choice copies of foreign works. Treaties of commerce were
generally negotiated by merchants, who were thus brought into contact
with courtiers and politicians, and not unfrequently the commercial
treaty was but the veil to conceal more profound political
intrigues. We need not, therefore, be surprised to find a commission
issued by Edward IV., in 1464, to Richard Whitehill and
William Caxton, conferring on them the quality of ambassadors at
the court of Burgundy, to reopen the trade with that country, which
had been suspended in consequence of certain prohibitive decrees
issued by Philip the Good. All that we know of Caxton up to this
time was, that he had begun his education in a poor school of the
weald of Kent, and had probably perfected it in some one of the
London grammar-schools; that he had been apprenticed to Master
Robert Large, a mercer of Cheapside, who became Lord Mayor in
1440, and dying the next year, left the sum of twenty marks to his
<em>servant</em> William Caxton. Then he appears as a travelling agent of
the London mercers in Brabant, and Holland, and Flanders, in
which countries he spent thirty years of his life, and at last we find
him at the court of Burgundy, to which the Flemish provinces were
then subject. When his mission was ended, he continued to reside
at the court, and was at Bruges in 1468, when the marriage took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593"></a>[593]</span>
place between Duke Charles the Bold and Margaret Plantagenet,
sister to Edward IV. He probably received some office in the
household of the Duchess, but he seems to have had little to do,
and to fill up his time the English mercer took to literary pursuits;
considering, as he says, that every man is bounden by the counsel
of the wise man to eschew sloth and idleness. He therefore resolved
to translate into English the “Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye,”
by Raoul de Fevre, wherein he had great delight, both for the
novelty of the same, and the fair language of the French; and having
concluded to begin this work, he forthwith took pen and ink, and set
to work; but after writing five or six quires, fell into despair over his
task and put it aside. Duchess Margaret, however, at this juncture
came to his aid: she had heard of his proposed translation, and
required the quires to be brought to her for inspection; praised
them, found fault with the English here and there, and finally commanded
the translator to continue and make an end.</p>

<p>“I might not disobey her dreadful command,” says Caxton,
“seeing that I was a servant of her Grace, and received of her yearly
fee.” Dibdin, in his “Typographical Antiquities,” endeavours to
prove that Caxton had <em>printed</em> the original French book before
<em>translating</em> it into English; but this is mere conjecture, and there
seem no satisfactory grounds for supposing him to have turned his
attention to the new art of printing before the year 1471, when his
English translation of the “Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye” was
printed by him at Cologne. We are not told how he acquired a
knowledge of the art, which had then been in operation for about
twenty years, but the motive which led to his first applying himself
to it was, as he tells us, the desire to multiply copies of his book,
which was in request with divers gentlemen. Three years later he
returned to England and set up the first English printing-press in the
Almonry of Westminster Abbey, the learned abbot Millyng being his
first patron, and evincing a lively interest in his success. Caxton’s
earliest works were mostly his own translations; “The Game and
Play of Chess” was the first production of his Westminster press,
and its second edition was adorned with woodcuts. Another was
“The Doctrine of Sapience,” also translated by him from the French,
and intended “for the use of parish priests, and for the erudition of
simple people.” “The Dictes and Sayings of Philosophers” was
a translation from the pen of his accomplished friend Anthony
Woodville, Lord Rivers, who had so high an opinion of his printer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594"></a>[594]</span>
literary powers that he permitted him to overlook and correct the
sheets. This accomplished nobleman, the chosen “champion”
of the English ladies, the best scholar, the best poet, and the best
jouster of King Edward’s court, helped to set the types with his own
hand, and afterwards presented both the book and the printer to his
royal brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Caxton did not altogether pursue his art in the spirit of a tradesman.
He evidently had it much at heart to provide his countrymen
with good and useful books, and took considerable pains in their
selection. In spite of Gibbon’s sneer at the number of saints’
legends<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and romances that issued from his press, we have every
reason to admire the variety of subjects to be found in the sixty-four
works which he lived to publish. They embrace religion history,
poetry, law, ritual, and romance. No original work of the Latin
classics appears on the list, which does not argue much for the
scholarship of the English reading public at that time, and offers a
striking contrast to the state of things in Italy, where the first works
printed at the Subiaco press were “Lactantius,” St. Augustine’s
“City of God,” and Cicero’s “Rhetoric;” and these were followed
a little later by twenty-three editions of ancient Latin authors. But
in England, though a few individuals had shown an interest in the
classic revival, the nation at large was, at this time, wholly indifferent
to the subject, and Caxton had to consult their taste, at the same
time that he attempted to raise and refine it. He himself was no
classical scholar; nevertheless, he chose a certain number of French
versions of ancient authors for translation into English, such as the
Treatise “De Senectute” of Cicero, Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
Boethius’ “De Consolatione,” the “Fables of Æsop,” and Cato’s
“Morals.” The last he recommended as the best book that could
be used by children in schools. He likewise translated a French
narrative of Virgil’s “Æneid;” and contemptible as this sort of
literature may appear to scholars, it helped to give his readers a
certain acquaintance with the names and subjects of classical authors,
and prepared the way for the study of the originals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the number of English works which he produced,
and the care he expended on presenting them to his readers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595"></a>[595]</span>
in clear and simple language, “casting away the chaff of superfluity,
and showing the picked gram of sentence,” gave a powerful stimulus
to his native literature. His own favourite author was Chaucer, in
printing whose works he grudged neither care nor expense: and he
incidentally gives us to understand that the English gentry of that
period had, like himself, a marvellous love for their great poet. He
had no slight difficulty in getting a correct MS. to print from, and
his first edition of Chaucer’s poems was, therefore, full of inaccuracies.
A young gentleman criticised its defects, and offered, if
he would print another edition, to supply him with a certain very
correct copy, which was in the possession of his father, who loved it
much, and would not willingly part with it. Caxton agreed to the
proposal, by which, of course, he lost considerably as a tradesman,
but gained in the esteem of the learned: and one is glad to find
that the young gentleman, in fulfilment of his part of the bargain,
did not purloin the book from his father but “got it from him full
gently,” and delivered it to the careful custody of the honest printer.</p>

<p>Not content with the labour of printing and translating, which he
carried on with so much eagerness that, as he tells us, his eyes were
half blinded with continual looking at the white paper, the indefatigable
old man undertook, at the age of seventy, to compose his
“Chronicles of England,” and “Description of Britain,” which books
he intended to convey to English readers a certain amount of information
about the history and geography of their own country. He
had plenty of critics while engaged on these works; some wanted
him to use only “old and homely” terms; others, who were finer
clerks, begged him to write the most <em>curious</em> words he could find.
Caxton good humouredly complains of the difficulty he found in
pleasing everybody, and remarks on the variable character of the
English language, which gives ground for supposing that the English
people must be born under the domination of the moon, never
steadfast, but ever wavering. His own good sense, however, decided
that the best English for any writer to use is that common phraseology
which is more readily understood than what is antique or
curious. He never assumed the airs of a scholar, and in his preface
to a modernised version of Higden’s “Polychronicon,” calls himself
“William Caxton, a simple person,” and modestly apologises for his
attempt to render the rude old English of his author into more intelligible
language.</p>

<p>One of his translations from the French, entitled “The Mirror of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596"></a>[596]</span>
the World,” gives an outline of as much natural philosophy as was
at that time known. This book was printed at the request, and at
the cost, of Hugh Brice, a London alderman, and the choice speaks
well for the intelligence of that worthy citizen. Caxton seems to
have taken considerable pains over it, and says he has made it so
plain, that every <em>reasonable</em> man may understand it, and begs his
readers’ indulgence if there be found any fault in the measurements
of the sun, moon, or firmament. To assist the intelligence of his
“reasonable” readers, he added twenty-seven diagrams explanatory
of scientific principles, and woodcuts representing the seven liberal
arts. In these woodcuts we observe that the schoolmaster generally
appears seated, while his scholars kneel before him. The grammar-master
is furnished with a rod, which need not cause dismay, for
perhaps it was but the ferule, part of the academic insignia of a
master of arts. The logician’s book rests on a reading-desk, and he
is expounding its contents to his kneeling pupils.</p>

<p>Dibdin calculates that Caxton’s translations alone would fill
twenty-five octavo volumes, and that they extend to over 5000
closely-printed pages. His biographer Lewis bears witness to the
fact that in his original writings he constantly expresses himself as
“a man who lived in the fear of God, and desired much to promote
His honour and glory.” But he thinks it necessary to regret that he
should have been carried away by the superstitions of his times so
far as to print saints’ legends, advocate pilgrimages to the Holy Land,
and proclaim himself an enthusiastic admirer of the Crusades.
Mercer and printer as he was, Caxton was indeed thoroughly informed
with the spirit of chivalry. It was this that directed his
choice of “The History of Godfrey de Bouillon,” “The Book of
Chivalry,” and the “Histories of King Arthur.” In his preface to
the first, the venerable printer makes an appeal to all Christian
princes to establish peace and amity one with another and unite for
the recovery of the Holy City, where our Blessed Saviour Jesus
Christ redeemed us with His Precious Blood; to encourage them to
which “he emprised to translate his book.” In the second he utters
a lament for the good days when the knights of England were really
knights, “when each man knew his horse, and his horse knew him.”
And in the third he confesses his conviction that Arthur was no
fabulous character, but a real man; and exhorts his readers to study
his noble deeds, “for herein may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy,
humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship, cowardice, murder,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_597"></a>[597]</span>
hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the good, and leave the evil undone,
and it shall bring you good fame and honour.”</p>

<p>Lewis informs us that the progress of printing terribly alarmed the
ignorant and illiterate monks, who saw in the advancement of learning
their own impending ruin. If so, they took a very strange way
of expressing their alarm, for they were the first to patronise the new
invention; so that in a very few years after Caxton had set up his
press in Westminster Abbey, other printing-presses were at work in the
monasteries of St. Alban’s, Worcester, Bury, and others. The monk
who first introduced printing at St. Alban’s was the schoolmaster;
his name is not known, though Sir H. Chauncey styles him “Insomuch.”
Bale and Pits tell us that he was a reader in history, and say
that he had collected materials for a history of England, but died
before it was completed, that his papers fell into Caxton’s hands,
who printed them under his own name. But this is evidently incorrect.
The St. Alban’s printer was still working his press in 1486;
and Caxton’s chronicles were printed six years earlier. Before the
death of Caxton, several other printers, both English and foreign,
were established in London, and among the latter was the celebrated
Fleming Wynkyn de Worde. An Oxford press was at work so early
as 1478, and seven years later the Latin translation of the Epistles
of Phalaris issued from the press, to which is affixed a Latin
couplet, boasting that the English who had been wont in former
times to be indebted to the Venetians for their books, now themselves
exported books to foreign countries:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>However, I have no intention here of tracing the history of English
printers, and have only said thus much of Caxton, because he
presents us with an admirable example of an intelligent Englishman
of the middle class&mdash;a practical persevering man, full of the healthy
energy which belongs to a life of labour; a vigorous, homely writer
who desired, in his day, to serve his country in so far as he had the
needful “cunning;” whose plain broad sense is illumined by a ray
of piety, and warmed into a touch of generous enthusiasm, which
makes his name more dear and venerable to us than that of many
a profounder scholar. Is it fancy or partiality which makes one
detect in the fair large type that he uses, so clear and readable, a
reflection of his own simple and genuine character; a character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598"></a>[598]</span>
which, making allowance for the difference of station, reminds us of
that of the great Alfred, to whose written language also that of
Caxton bears a remarkable resemblance.</p>

<p>He died in the year 1492, at the age of eighty, having two years
previously completed his translation of “The Craft how to Die Well,”
from which the following is an extract:&mdash;“When it is so, that what
a man maketh or doeth, it is made to come to some end, and if the
thing be good and well made, it must needs come to good end; then,
by better and greater reason, every man ought to intend in such wise
to live in this world in keeping the commandments of God that he
may come to a good end. And then out of this world, full of
wretchedness and tribulation, he may go to heaven unto God and
His saints, into joy perdurable.”</p>

<p>Two years after writing these lines he was laid to rest in the
Church of St. Margaret’s, Westminster, not far from the spot where
for eighteen years he had carried on his noble and useful labours.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1400 TO 1492.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Eastern</span> travellers tell us of certain richly-irrigated soils in tropical
lands, whereon the seeds that are cast spring up in a single night,
covering, as if by magic, vasts plains, which before appeared barren
wastes, with a mantle of tender green. Something like this was the
rapid fertilisation exhibited in the world of letters after the death of
Petrarch. More than a century, indeed, had to elapse before Italy
could produce any names fit to compete with those of Dante, Petrarch,
or Bocaccio; but the freshly-awakened enthusiasm for ancient learning,
to which the writings of the two latter had so largely contributed,
gave birth to a generation of scholars whose labours communicated
a new direction to European studies. They did not leave behind
them, as monuments of their genius, epic poems or philosophical
discoveries, but they disinterred forgotten manuscripts, restored their
corrupted texts, revived the study of Greek, and at the same time
made known to Western Christendom the works of the great Greek
authors by means of their own laborious Latin translations. They
were, in short, a generation of grammarians, critics, and pedagogues,
and were the instruments of achieving an intellectual revolution
hardly less momentous than the religious and political revolutions
which were to follow in after years.</p>

<p>The watered soil and the fruitful seed did not fail to be cherished
by the sun of princely favour. The fifteenth century was not more
remarkable for its learned men, than for its noble patrons of learning.
In Naples there was Alphonsus of Arragon, who, in the midst of his
warlike campaigns, had the Commentaries of Cæsar read to him
daily, and whose displeasure against the Florentine Republic was
appeased by the timely present of a copy of Livy. When Gianozzo
Manetti was sent to him as ambassador from Florence, and delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600"></a>[600]</span>
to him his opening oration, the king, out of respect to so great a
scholar, would not so much as raise his hand to brush away a troublesome
fly; and on one occasion, when Manetti had joined in a dispute
which Alphonsus was carrying on with certain learned men of his
court on the subject of the Holy Trinity, he so won the royal heart
by his skill and eloquence that the king exclaimed, “Had I but a
single loaf, I would divide it with Gianozzo!” He was one of the
greatest book collectors of his time, and loved to surround himself
with scholars, such as Antony of Palermo, commonly known as
Panormita, who is said to have cured his royal master of a fever by
reading to him the Life of Alexander, by Quintus Curtius. Perhaps
it was after his recovery that Alphonsus despatched Panormita to
Venice for the singular purpose of begging from the Venetian senators
<em>an arm</em> of the Roman historian, with which classical relic he
triumphantly returned to Naples. Most of the other men of letters
who then flourished in Italy, such as Poggio, Filelfo, Valla, and
George of Trebizond, were at one time or other attached to his court,
and magnificently rewarded for their literary labours; and Pius II.,
in his “Description of Europe,” numbers Alphonsus himself among
the philosophers of the day, and says that he could discourse both
learnedly and gracefully on the most abstruse theological questions.</p>

<p>At Ferrara, Nicholas of Este not only refounded the university of
that city, but succeeded in gaining possession of two great teachers,
Guarino the Elder, and John Aurispa, who directed the education
of his son Lionel, and whose schools were frequented by students
from every European land. Lionel repaid their care by himself
becoming an elegant scholar, and establishing at his court an academy
of poetry; and his brother Borso, who succeeded him, proved, perhaps,
a yet more splendid patron of letters, though he had not himself
received a learned education. A new poem of Leonardi, a map of
the world, or a correct copy of Ptolemy’s geography, were treasures
which won from Duke Borso many a golden florin for the scholar
fortunate enough to present them; and the archives of Ferrara and
Modena became crowded with decrees for the protection of scholars,
which Tiraboschi assures us are no less remarkable for the elegant
Latinity in which they are drawn up, than for the munificent spirit
in which they are conceived.</p>

<p>The Gonzaghi held rule at Mantua, and there an academy flourished
under the princely patronage of the Marquis John Francis, concerning
which I must speak a little more particularly, as its master in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601"></a>[601]</span>
some respects stands alone among the pedagogues of the Renaissance.
Who has not heard of Victorino da Feltre, and the “Casa Giojosa,”
in which he taught his crowd of princely pupils, contriving to mingle
in their ranks not a few poor scholars, the perpetual objects of his
generous solicitude; whose fame was so widely spread, and whose
blameless character was so respected, that in those days of bitter
scholastic jealousies all the greatest masters of Italy offered him their
gratuitous services, and counted it an honour to direct a class
in the “Joyous House” of Mantua? The house derived its name
from the beauty of its situation, and the care which Gonzaga had
taken to adorn it with everything that could contribute to the
pleasure or instruction of its inmates. It contained galleries and
arcades, all painted with pictures of children at prayer, at study, or
at play; around it stretched delicious gardens and woods well
stored with game, and the graver lectures of the master were
relieved by lessons in riding, dancing, fencing, and every other
graceful accomplishment suitable for noble youth. Victorino, on
assuming the direction of the academy, did not entirely discountenance
these pleasant pastimes, nor did he turn the Joyous House into
a Castle Dismal; he contented himself with introducing such reforms
as banished habits of self-indulgence, and prepared his pupils, not
only to become elegant gentlemen, but hardy soldiers. He reduced
the princely banquets to a reasonable limit, confiscated sweetmeats,
and showed himself pitiless upon all coxcombry in dress. It is
remarkable, that though he left not a line behind him as a monument
of his scholarship, his celebrity has survived to our own day,
and certainly equals that of the greatest of his contemporaries, resting
as it does solely on his merits as a teacher of youth. Not merely
was he distinguished as a lecturer in Greek, Latin, and mathematics
(though even in that capacity he had few equals), but as one who
trained the heart, formed the manners, and established, as the basis
of all education, a strict observance of religious duties, victory over the
passions, and the mortification of pride, selfishness, and sensuality.</p>

<p>A no less passionate admirer of the ancient authors than his friend
Guarino, who often assisted him in his school, Victorino was careful
to guard his pupils from the paganising tendencies which he discerned
in the spirit of the age. Along with the Greek and Latin
classics, therefore, he presented to their study the Fathers of the
Church, and the Divine Scriptures, and when lecturing on the heathen
poets and historians, he was wont, in a few luminous words, to lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602"></a>[602]</span>
before his hearers the grand Christian principles which were never
to be effaced from the soul by Gentile sophistries and eloquence.
Those principles he taught yet more by example than by precept.
Two hours before his classes opened, Victorino might have been
found in the hospitals and prisons of Mantua, relieving and comforting
every form of distress. He founded among his noble pupils an
association of charity, for enabling poor scholars to pursue their
studies with greater facility, and this he did, not merely as a means
of carrying out his favourite work of charity, but yet more with the
view of training the sons of the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">noblesse</i> from their earliest
years to care for the inferior classes, and to give to the poor out of
their abundance. His whole life was marked by a total disregard of
his own private interests. The good Marchioness, Paula Gonzaga,
never made but one complaint of him, and that was, that often as
she tried to furnish him with a better wardrobe, he frustrated her
charitable attempts; for so soon as he found himself possessed of
two coats, one went to clothe a poorer man than himself. It may be
added, that though a simple layman, he embraced a stricter rule of
life than was followed by many an ecclesiastic of the time. In an
age when the practice of frequent communion was far from common,
he approached the holy table twice every week, and encouraged his
pupils to communicate every Sunday. It is said that in the early
part of his scholastic career, his intercourse with St. John Capistran
and St. Bernardine of Siena had awakened in his soul a strong desire
to enter the cloister, from which he was deterred by the arguments of
his learned friend Ambrose Traversari, who assured him that his
vocation was to remain in the world, and there train souls for heaven.
And as a divine vocation he embraced it; and cast over the
scholastic profession a grace, a dignity and a beauty of holiness
which made Eugenius IV. exclaim, when he was presented to him at
Florence, “If my rank as Supreme Pontiff permitted it, I would rise
from my seat to show honour to so great a man!”</p>

<p>However, it must not be supposed that Victorino was a mere
devotee, or that his school was of a retrograde class, excluding the
new lights of classical literature. He was the friend and correspondent
of all the scholars of his day, and the pupils of the “Casa
Giojosa” were no whit behind their countrymen in classical acquirements.
Ambrose Traversari, who was considered to equal Leonard
of Arezzo as a Latinist, and to surpass him in his knowledge of
Greek, has left an account, in his “Hodœporicon” and in his epistles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603"></a>[603]</span>
of a visit which he paid to the school of Victorino, and a kind of
friendly examination to which he subjected its pupils. “I reached
Mantua,” he writes, “where I was welcomed with singular kindness
by Victorino, the best of men, and my very dear friend. He is with
me as much as his serious occupations allow; and not he alone, but
the greater part of his disciples. Some of them are so well advanced
in Greek, that they translate it into Latin. He teaches Greek to the
sons and daughters of the prince, and they all write in that language.”
Again, “Yesterday Victorino presented to me Gian Lucido, the
youngest son of the prince of Mantua, a youth of about fourteen.
He recited to me 200 Latin verses of his own composition, in which
he described the pomp with which the Emperor Sigismund had been
received at Mantua. The little poem was very beautiful, and rendered
more so by the grace and correctness of its delivery. Then he showed
me two theorems which the boy had added to the geometry of
Euclid. There was also one of his sisters at the academy who,
though only ten years old, writes Greek so well, that I am ashamed
to say many of my own scholars cannot show anything to equal it.”
This last-named pupil was Cecilia Gonzaga, whose learning afterwards
became renowned throughout Italy. Her sister Margaret, also
a pupil of Victorino, became the wife of Lionel of Este, but she
herself consecrated her talents to God, and entered a convent of poor
Clares, founded by her mother in the city of Mantua.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>While the smaller potentates of Italy were vying one with another
in their encouragement of letters and learned men, the Sovereign
Pontiffs were setting them the example on a yet more magnificent
scale. From 1447 to 1455 the chair of St. Peter was filled by
Nicholas V., who to extreme simplicity of manners united immense
learning, and a mind capable of vast and magnificent designs.
Whilst he was restoring peace to Italy putting an end to the schism
which had sprung out of the Council of Basle, planning a fresh
crusade, and laying plans for the rebuilding of Rome, on a plan realised
only in the pages of Vasari, his agents were busy, all over the world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604"></a>[604]</span>
collecting, collating, or translating manuscripts, and giving to the
world, in versions undertaken at his sole expense, those long-forgotten
works of classical antiquity, the “History of Diodorus Siculus,” the
“Cyropedia” of Xenophon, the histories of Polybius, Thucydides,
and Herodotus, the “Iliad” of Homer, the geography of Strabo,
many of the works of Plato, and the Greek Fathers of the Church.
Most of the scholars of whom we shall have to speak in the following
pages were employed by him as translators and secretaries, and were
amply recompensed for their work. Poggio was thus enabled to
complete his version of Diodorus. Lorenzo Valla received 500 gold
scudi for his translation of Thucydides; 10,000 scudi, a house and
estate, were promised to Filelfo for his translation of Homer, and
when giving Perotti 500 scudi for his Latin Polybius, the Pontiff
condescended to apologise for the smallness of the sum, which he
owned was below the value of the book. He is known to have offered
5000 scudi for a Hebrew version of St. Matthew’s Gospel, which,
however, was never found. In his early years he had often given
utterance to the promise that if he ever found himself in the possession
of riches, he would employ them in the multiplication of good
books. He nobly kept his word; and, when he died, left, as his
bequest to his successor, the Vatican library, furnished, through his
munificence, with 5000 precious manuscripts.</p>

<p>The accession to the pontifical chair of Eneas Sylvius Piccolomini,
who became Pope in 1458, under the title of Pius II., seemed to
promise much for the world of letters. He had already acquired a
European fame as a poet and historian, and had received the laurel
crown from the hands of Frederic III. But his short pontificate was
almost entirely absorbed in preparations for the projected crusade,
which he had resolved to undertake for the recovery of the Eastern
Empire, and death alone prevented his carrying out his grand designs,
and accompanying the army into the East in order to encourage the
soldiers with his presence. Meanwhile a flood of Greek refugees
poured into Europe, contributing very largely to encourage the restoration
of ancient learning, though they certainly had not given the
movement its first impulse. Even before the fall of Constantinople
in 1453, many Greek scholars had judged it prudent to pass over
into Italy in order to escape the ruin impending over their country.
Others, again, had been attracted thither by the Council of Florence,
held in 1441, for the extinction of the Greek schism. Among the
latter was the celebrated Bessarion, Archbishop of Nice, who, convinced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605"></a>[605]</span>
of the fallacy of the Greek claims by the arguments of the
Latin prelates, urged his countrymen to acknowledge the supremacy
of the Holy See, and thereby incurred so much odium among them
as to be forced to remain in exile. He was raised to the purple by
Pope Eugenius IV., and employed in several important legations,
but it was as a man of letters that he chiefly distinguished himself.
His house at Rome became a sort of academy, and in it he trained
a number of scholars, both Greek and Latin, not only in learning,
but in piety and good manners; for Bessarion was as remarkable for
his courtesy and virtue as for his erudition. His great library, collected
at a cost of 30,000 golden scudi, was presented to the
Republic of Venice, in return for the affection with which he had
been received in that city; and though he only acquired a knowledge
of the Latin tongue after his removal to Italy, he produced several
works in that language, among which was a “Defence” of his
favourite philosopher Plato.</p>

<p>But neither Rome nor Naples was destined to be the Athens of
modern Europe, but a city, still proud of her republican institutions,
though on the point of surrendering all but the name of sovereignty
into the hands of a successful family of merchant princes. Many
circumstances had combined to render Florence the focus of the
great literary movement then in progress, and thither chiefly resorted
the exiled Greek scholars&mdash;such as Argyrophilus, George of Trebizond,
Theodore of Gaza, and Gemistus. Schools had been opened in
this city so early as 1393 by Emmanuel Chrysoloras, which may be
said to have given the first impulse to the revival of Greek studies.
Emmanuel came over to Italy, in the first instance, in the quality of
ambassador from Constantinople, to seek for aid against the Turkish
arms among the princes of the West. But he found it more to his
taste, and possibly also to his profit, to exchange his diplomatic functions
for those of a professor of letters, and soon reckoned among
his disciples a group of scholars who were in their turn promoted to
chairs of Greek rhetoric in the universities of Venice, Ferrara,
Bologna, and Naples. One of these, Guarino, had been formerly
acquainted with Chrysoloras at Constantinople, whither he had
travelled in 1388 in search of manuscripts. Guarino was at that
time only eighteen years of age, and after acquiring the Greek
language, he set out on his return to Italy, bearing with him two
great chests filled with the treasures which he had collected. A
storm overtook the vessel, and in his dismay the captain ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606"></a>[606]</span>
whole cargo on board the ship to be cast into the sea. In vain did
Guarino throw himself at his feet, and conjure him to spare his
precious volumes; they were ruthlessly hurled to the fishes, and
when morning dawned the poor scholar’s raven locks were discovered
to have turned as white as snow, such had been the anguish which
his loss had caused him. However, if he had lost his books, he had
not lost his learned gifts, and on reaching Italy, he became professor
of rhetoric, first at Florence, and afterwards at Venice and Ferrara.
John Aurispa was more fortunate in his researches, and succeeded,
in 1423, in bringing back to Italy 238 Greek manuscripts. We have
already spoken of him as lecturing at Ferrara under the patronage
of the Este. He was secretary both to Eugenius IV. and Nicholas
V., and before settling at Ferrara had also taught both at Bologna
and Florence. He was succeeded in the chair of rhetoric in the
latter city by the celebrated Filelfo, who had likewise made the grand
tour of the East, and brought home a magnificent Greek library.
This last-named scholar had studied at Constantinople under
John Chrysoloras, brother to Emmanuel, whose daughter Theodora
he married, a circumstance which swelled his already preposterous
vanity, and which he never lost any opportunity of trumpeting to the
Greek-loving world.</p>

<p>Filelfo, on returning to Italy, first selected Bologna as the happy
spot which was to be blessed with his erudite presence. He entered
the city in a sort of triumph, the enthusiastic populace giving him the
welcome ordinarily reserved for sovereign princes, and erecting a
chair of Moral Philosophy and <ins class="corr" id="tn606" title="Transcriber’s Note—“eloquence for his express ocoupation” to “eloquence for his express occupation”.">eloquence for his express occupation</ins>,
with the handsome annual salary of 450 gold scudi. Every day saw
some new festa invented to do honour to the great Professor and
his charming “Chrysolorine,” as he somewhat affectedly designated
his Greek spouse; and for a brief space Filelfo declared himself
satisfied with the amount of homage offered to his genius. “Bologna
is a charming city,” he writes in one of his epistles; “the inhabitants
are courteous, and not insensible to letters; and what specially pleases
me is the consideration and affection which they display towards <em>me</em>.”
In 1428, however, a popular revolution dissipated all these pleasing
prospects; Filelfo, in company with the Papal Legate, had to fly for
his life, and while the cities of Italy scrambled which should obtain
possession of so rare a scholar, the coveted prize fell to the share of
Florence, where Cosmo de’ Medici and his rival, Philip Strozzi, were
just then struggling which should outshine the other in acts of princely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607"></a>[607]</span>
munificence. The vanity of Filelfo was once more for a time amply
gratified for the Florentines yielded him their hearty applause, and
if we are to credit his own words, made him the great lion of their
city. “All Florence runs after me” he writes in his letters; “everybody
loves me; everybody honours me and lauds me to the skies;
my name is in everybody’s mouth. Not only the first men of the
city, but the noble ladies also give place when they meet me, and
show me so much respect that I am really ashamed. I have every
day 400 hearers, or more, and all of them persons of rank and
importance.”</p>

<p>And it must be owned that Filelfo worked hard to gain their
applause. The routine of his everyday work involved an amount of
labour to voice and brain, under which any one but a professor of
the fifteenth century must have succumbed. About daybreak he
began by lecturing to a crowded audience on Cicero, Livy, or the
Iliad. His explanations of Cicero were considered his greatest
successes and by his ready and brilliant eloquence he seemed to
reproduce the Roman orator to the eyes and ears of his hearers.
Returning home, he gave audience to the favoured few who were
happy enough to be on his list of private pupils; and at mid-day he
was again in the public chair, commenting on Terence, or the Greek
historians, Xenophon and Thucydides. Every evening there were
literary reunions and learned academies to be attended, or private
assemblies, in which Filelfo was, or, at any rate, considered himself
to be, the great centre of attraction, and nurtured his good opinion
of himself with the homage of an obsequious crowd. Even Sunday
was no day of rest to him, for then, in the Church of Sta. Maria dei
Fiori, he lectured and commented on Dante.</p>

<p>The fascination of such a life, however, had a make-weight of
mortification. Filelfo was possessed with one of those bitter and
malignant dispositions that turn the very sweets of life into poison.
His very jokes were malignant, as, when disputing with another
grammarian on the quantity of a Greek syllable, he offered to pay him
200 scudi if he were proved wrong, on condition that, if right, he
might have the satisfaction of shaving off his adversary’s beard.
The poor grammarian lost his wager, and, in spite of all his entreaties,
Filelfo gratified his revenge in the true spirit of a literary Shylock.
It was quite enough for any other scholar to be praised and honoured
for him to become at once the mark for Filelfo’s spite. “What does
Guarino know, of which Filelfo is ignorant?” he exclaims in one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608"></a>[608]</span>
his letters, his bile being excited by the fact that Guarino’s name was
just then in everybody’s mouth. This intolerable presumption raised
him enemies in every city; and, indeed, in those days it seems to
have been the habit of literary men to spend the greater part of their
time in biting and devouring one another. Filelfo, perhaps, may be
regarded as the most venomous disputant of them all. He who
talked so much of being “loved” by everybody, hated and made
himself hated by the entire world. He hated the men of learning who
shared with him the favour of the Florentines, because he regarded
them as his rivals. He hated the great Cosmo, the Pericles of the
New Athens, because his benefits were not exclusively showered on
himself. He hated the good and honest citizen Niccoli, the founder
of St. Mark’s public library, because he was a friend of the Medici.
And he hated the very populace who gaped and wondered at his
erudition, because his appetite for flattery growing as it was ministered
to, they could not always satisfy its cravings, and at such times Filelfo
was ready to denounce them all in that malignant language of which
the elegant commentator on Tully was an accomplished master.
He poured out his venom on Cosmo in a series of villanous libels,
accusing him of attempting his life by poison and the dagger; yet,
at the very time when he was inventing these calumnies against a
man who had loaded him with favours, he was himself hiring
assassins to attack his rival, Carlo Marsuppini, in the streets of
Florence&mdash;a crime for which the Republic afterwards condemned him
to have his tongue cut out, should he ever set foot again upon their
territory.</p>

<p>To his other vices Filelfo added that of a grasping avarice: he was
continually appealing to the different princes of Italy for larger money
advances, and loading them with abuse if they did not satisfy his
demands. He threatened Pius II. to turn Turk, if the pension
granted by that Pontiff were not more regularly paid; and his contemporary
scholars continually complained that, after promising them
books, he would afterwards withdraw from his bargain, and demand
back again from them what was not really his own property. But,
in candour, it must be confessed that, in this last-named matter,
Filelfo appears to have been more sinned against than sinning. A
very bad habit prevailed at that time among literary men of borrowing
books and never returning them. Francesco Barbaro is accused
of keeping a chest of Filelfo’s books for thirty years; and similar
peccadilloes are charged to the account of Aurispa and Giustiniani.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609"></a>[609]</span>
Possibly, observes Tiraboschi, they regarded book thefts in the same
light as monks had been used occasionally to regard the pilfering of
holy relics. Anyhow, the injury was sensibly felt by the unfortunate
owner, and did not improve the asperity of his temper.</p>

<p>Whatever infamy attaches to the character of Filelfo, he met with
his match in one of the literary rivals whom he encountered at
Florence. Poggio Bracciolini had received his education in his
native city, and to a perfect knowledge of Latin and Greek literature
added the rarer merit of being a good Hebrew scholar. For thirty-four
years of his life he held the office of apostolic secretary under
successive Pontiffs, and during all that time he never spent an entire
year in any one city. He was present in his official capacity at the
Council of Constance, and to while away the hours that hung heavy
on his hands, made an excursion to the neighbouring abbey of St.
Gall, and disinterred from a damp tower the mouldering manuscript
of Quinctilian’s “Institutes.” From thence he passed over to
England to pursue his researches in the monastic libraries of this
country, but declares that they were full of nothing but “modern
doctors, whom <em>we</em> should not think worthy so much as to be heard.”
By his discoveries of classic authors, and his own critical and historical
writings, he contributed more than any other scholar of his
time to the revival of learning, so that some writers have gone so far
as to confer on the first half of the fifteenth century the title of “the
age of Poggio.” But his glory was sadly clouded by the furious
quarrels in which he engaged with all his contemporaries, and the
foul and disgraceful language which he poured out against every one
who was unhappy enough to come into collision with him. Among
the works of this great champion of classic Latinity are four “Invectives”
against Filelfo, and five against Lorenzo Valla. The latter
were written in revenge for certain criticisms which Valla had
published of his Epistles, and are, says Tiraboschi, “a disgraceful
monument to the memory of a writer who observes neither rule nor
measure, but defiles his pen with every hideous abomination which
malice could suggest against his adversaries.” Valla, who was a
scholar of precisely the same temper, replied in his “Antidotes to
Poggio,” and Filelfo in his “Satires”&mdash;all of which are said to be
conceived in the same rabid and malignant strain. Nor was it only
against such men as these that Poggio directed his venom. Guarino
was made the subject of another ferocious onslaught, for no worse
misdemeanour than having differed from Poggio in preferring the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610"></a>[610]</span>
character of Cæsar to that of Scipio! George of Trebizond, a man
of like temper to his own, was another of his opponents, and on one
occasion the two disputants, after publicly giving each other the lie,
came to blows, and were with difficulty separated by their hearers.
And at last this detestable spirit grew on him to such a degree that,
no longer content with attacking individuals, he published libels, if
we may so say, on the literary world at large, and did his best in his
“Dialogue against Hypocrites,” to slaughter the reputation of every
man of virtue and celebrity in the world of letters, such as the Blessed
John Dominic, Ambrose Traversari, Cardinal Luca Manzuoli, and
the entire Franciscan Order. With all this, Poggio probably held
the first place among the scholars of his time, unless the superiority
be given to his adversary, Lorenzo Valla, who is generally held
to have surpassed him in grammatical erudition. Erasmus, indeed,
treated the merits of Poggio very lightly. “Poggio was possessed of
so little real learning,” he says, “that, even if his books were less full
of abominations than they are, they would not repay perusal; as it
is, were he even the most erudite of writers, all good men must regard
him with horror.” Nor can a much better character be given to
Valla; in arrogance and vanity he equalled Filelfo; and in his
famous “Treatise on the Elegance of the Latin Tongue,” gave the
world to understand that he was about to explain a language which
before his time had been understood by none. “These books,” he
says, “<em>will contain nothing that has ever been said by anybody else</em>.
For many ages past, not only has no one been able to speak Latin,
but none have understood the Latin they read, the philosophers
have had no comprehension of the philosophers, the advocates of the
orators, the lawyers of the jurists,” and so of the rest. This kind of
self confidence is, however, so universal among scholars of the age
as hardly to call for special notice; but it was the least fault of which
Valla stands charged. Passing over grosser accusations brought
against him by adversaries whose habits of calumny render their
testimony of little value, there was a taint of ingratitude in Valla’s
character which is particularly offensive. Having, in his “Declamation
against the Donation of Constantine,” attacked the claims of
the Holy See in terms which Hallam himself admits could not be
excused, be retired from Rome, and found a warm welcome at the
court of Naples. Here, however, he soon got involved in difficulties
with the Inquisition, in consequence of certain impieties to which he
gave utterance on the subject of the Holy Trinity and other fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611"></a>[611]</span>
dogmas of the faith. He was only released from prison
through the friendly interference of Panormita. Yet as soon as he
recovered his liberty he engaged in a furious quarrel with his benefactor,
and spared no calumnies by which he could bring discredit
on his name and character. He treated it as a crime for any one to
differ from him in any point of taste and criticism, and punished all
such transgressions by blackening the fair fame of his opponents.
Nevertheless, he met with far gentler treatment than he deserved,
for it was after he had established his renown as the best Latinist,
and, next to Poggio, the most malignant calumniator of his day, that
Nicholas V. invited him back to Rome, made him a canon of St.
John Lateran, and employed him in numerous translations, all of
which were liberally paid for. Valla accepted the dignities and the
money offered him by the Pope, and took advantage of his favourable
turn of fortune to complete that attack on the papal sovereignty
which he had before left unfinished; and he did so in a style which,
Hallam informs us, rather resembles the violence of Luther than
what might have been expected from a Roman official of the fifteenth
century. The clemency shown him by the Pope was perhaps
excessive, for he was suffered to live at Rome unmolested, and
retained the office and pension of apostolic secretary to the day of
his death.</p>

<p>It must be owned that the portrait gallery through which we are
passing, has thus far been anything but pleasing, nor can it be
denied that in their main features of malice and presumption, most
of the scholars of the age exhibit a family resemblance to those
noted above. Hallam observes that the inferior renown enjoyed by
Giannozzo Manetti, is probably owing to the greater mildness of
his character, which involved him in fewer of those altercations to
which Poggio and Valla owed a great part of their celebrity. And
Tiraboschi apologises to his readers for leaving some portions of his
history somewhat obscure, on the ground that the calumnies and
misrepresentations indulged in by almost all writers of the period,
render it nearly impossible to rely on any of their statements, and to
accept as facts anything which they may say unfavourable of one
another.</p>

<p>Some noble exceptions, however, are to be found, and among
them may be quoted the example of Leonard Bruni, or, as he is
more frequently styled from the place of his birth, Leonard Aretino.
Whilst Chancellor of Florence he one day engaged in a public philosophic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612"></a>[612]</span>
dispute with Giannozzo Manetti, in which the latter gained
the advantage over him. Stung with annoyance, Leonard let fall
some injurious words, to which, however, Giannozzo replied with his
customary good temper, and both returned to their respective homes.
But Leonard was so pursued by remorse for his fault that he could
not close his eyes all night, and so soon as morning dawned, he
hastened to the house of Giannozzo, who was greatly surprised to
see the first magistrate of Florence at his door at such an early hour.
Leonard, however, only bade him follow him into the city, and conducting
him to the great bridge over the Arno, then the most
frequented thoroughfare, he publicly asked his pardon, and acknowledged
he had had no rest since he had spoken injuriously of so
noble an adversary. Giannozzo received his apology with a modesty
which was equally admirable, and the friendship which from that
day sprung up between these two great men, remained unbroken to
the death of Leonard, on which occasion the funeral oration was
spoken over his body by Giannozzo.</p>

<p>From the scholars of Florence let us now turn to her Mecænas,
the merchant prince, who, for thirty years, held the first rank in the
Republic, and deserved to obtain from his grateful fellow citizens the
title of “Father of his country.” Cosmo de’ Medici was beyond all
question the greatest of his illustrious race. Machiavel calls him the
most magnificent and most generous of men, and Flavio declares
that he surpassed all his contemporaries in wisdom, humanity, and
liberality. His political career seems to have been for the most part
free from the vice of selfish ambition; whilst as a patron of letters,
even in that age of splendid patrons, he had no equal. In Florence
alone he founded three public libraries, expending 36,000 ducats on
that of St. Mark’s, which he enriched with 400 Latin and Greek
manuscripts, whilst he appointed as librarian Thomas di Sarzana,
afterwards Pope Nicholas V. A few years later he rebuilt the
library, and added a collection of Hebrew, Arabic, Sanscrit, and
Chaldaic books, collected at enormous cost. His love of literature
was so genuine, and so superior to the selfishness of a mere
bibliopolist, that even when in temporary exile at Venice, he could
not help opening his purse-strings in favour of the Venetian library
of St. George, and employed his fellow exile, the architect Michelozzi,
in providing it with reading benches and other conveniences, presenting
it also with many books. It was his wish to draw to Florence
all the learned men of the day. He it was who invited thither the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613"></a>[613]</span>
Greek Professor Argyrophilus, to the end that he might instruct the
Florentine youth in the philosophy of Aristotle. A vast number of
Greek exiles received from him a princely welcome, to say nothing
of the crowd of native scholars who thronged his palace. Pages
might be filled with the mere enumeration of the convents, churches,
and hospitals which he built or endowed, not merely at Florence,
but even at Jerusalem, where he founded a large hospital for poor
pilgrims. He had stewards and administrators in every part of
Europe, who helped him to dispense his treasures on worthy objects.
Yet with all this, his own establishment was always conducted on
the most modest scale, and he who enriched scores of Florentine
families, never assumed a more brilliant appearance than that of an
ordinary citizen. His liberality was altogether free from ostentation,
and appears to have flowed from the purest and most Christian
motives. “Never yet,” he complained to one of his friends, “have
I been able to spend in God’s honour the sums for which, when I
look over my ledger, I find myself indebted to Him.”</p>

<p>It was in the year 1438, whilst Pope Eugenius IV. was residing at
Florence, and the Council was still sitting which had for its object
the <ins class="corr" id="tn613" title="Transcriber’s Note—“extihction of the Greek schism” changed to “extinction of the Greek schism”.">extinction of the Greek schism</ins>, that a certain Greek, named
George Gemistus, arrived in the city, and one day entered the palace
of Cosmo with a copy of Plato under his arm. This celebrated
scholar had received the surname of <em>Pletho</em>, in consequence of his
enthusiastic admiration of the academic philosopher, and is more
commonly known by this sobriquet than by his patronymic. Pletho,
as we shall therefore call him, read a few pages of his book to the
enraptured ears of Cosmo, and very soon communicated to him a
portion of his own enthusiasm. Until then Cosmo had been a
stranger to all save the Peripatetic philosophy, and the ideas which
now presented themselves to his mind seemed like the opening of
some new world. In his delight he conceived the plan of establishing
a Platonic academy at Florence, a design which was put into
execution without delay. Platonism, however, was then so new in
the schools of the West, that Cosmo could find no professor who
seemed capable of filling the chair of philosophy to be attached to
this academy; and he resolved to educate for that purpose a child
whose talents had already attracted his notice. Marsilius Ficinus
was the son of his physician; his tiny frame and delicate constitution
seemed incapable of making head against the host of maladies with
which he had been beset from the cradle. But Cosmo’s quick eye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614"></a>[614]</span>
discerned the indications of early genius. “This boy,” he said, “is
destined to cure, not the maladies of the body, but those of the
soul.”</p>

<p>With his customary bounty, he became a second father to his
future professor, and under his direction, Ficinus received a
thoroughly Platonic education. He was carefully reared in the
maxims and philosophy of the great master, to the end that having
early imbibed the principles of Platonism as a kind of second nature,
he might be qualified afterwards to become the head preceptor of
the new academy. The whole scheme had something visionary
about it, and no less so was the character of the man chosen to
carry it out. From his boyhood he was a poet and a dreamer. He
loved to wander at early daybreak by the banks of the Arno, and
recite aloud to the woods and the stream the verses of Virgil’s
“Georgics.” Light and country air were his two necessaries; he
seemed to live in the sunshine, and on those rare occasions when
the fair sky of Florence was overspread with clouds, he could neither
write nor study. His work as a composer was exclusively carried
on in the early morning hours; then it was that his genius seemed
to wake with the sunrise; and if he also spent long night hours
over his manuscripts, he only then applied himself to the labour of
revision. Cosmo gave him a little lamp, which was often found
burning when daylight dawned in the east; he also provided him
with books, and specially with manuscripts of Plato procured from
Venice at an enormous cost, and to these Ficinus applied himself
with such incessant application, that his health almost entirely gave
way; in fact, his life seemed always hanging by a single thread, and
was preserved only by such extraordinary precautions as are bestowed
on some exotic plant. At the age of twenty-three, the young student
considered himself <ins class="corr" id="tn614" title="Transcriber’s Note—“ready to read to a learned asseinbly” changed to “ready to read to a learned assembly”.">ready to read to a learned assembly</ins>,
presided over by Cosmo, the first pages of his “Platonic
Institutions.” When the lecture was over, his patron smiled and
gently shook his head. Ficinus understood the gesture, but was not
discouraged; he prepared for a fresh course of studies, and placed
himself under the historian Platina, more illustrious for his Greek
erudition than for his orthodoxy, but the latter condition was not
greatly cared for by the young Platonist. In a few months he found
that he had made such rapid progress, that, remodelling his work, he
submitted it to the judgment of Marcus Musurus, the Greek professor of Venice,
and the first editor of Aristophanes. He found Musurus sitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_615"></a>[615]</span>
at his writing-table, and having engaged him to give an impartial
opinion, began the reading of his manuscript. As the professor
listened, he amused himself with turning over the various implements
before him. Ficinus at last paused, and asked him what he
thought of it.</p>

<p>“I think <em>this</em>,” said Musurus, and taking the ink bottle, he shook
it over the open manuscript as if it had been sand. Ficinus betrayed
no impatience, which is saying something for his philosophy; and
retiring to the country house which Cosmo had presented to him,
devoted himself to the task of a third revision. Before it was completed
his great patron died leaving his son Pietro and his grandson
Lorenzo de Medici to succeed him in his pre-eminence, both in the
literary and political world. Pietro and Lorenzo showed themselves
as eager to encourage the Platonic academy as its first founder had
been; and their enthusiasm was shared by their contemporaries.
All the scholars of Italy aspired to the honour of membership;
Landino, Alberti, and John Picus of Mirandola, these met together,
and contended for the silver laurel wreath, which was the prize of
merit; and one of Pietro’s first acts was to establish a professorship,
the chair of which was immediately bestowed on Ficinus. In the
meetings of this academy the honours bestowed on Plato came very
near to idolatry. Its festivals were the anniversaries of his birth and
death, a lamp was burnt in his honour, and the professor, in lecturing
to his fellow academicians, addressed them, not as “my brethren
in Christ,” but as “my brethren in Plato.” It was, perhaps, unfortunate
that Ficinus did not rest content with his professor’s chair and
his academic reputation. In such a position his Platonic enthusiasm
might have been productive of little injury, but at the age of forty-two
he entered the priesthood, became canon of Florence, and took
up the study of theology. Plato, however, was not laid aside for St.
Paul. On whatever subject he wrote or spoke, says Tiraboschi, he
seemed unable to refrain from tinging it with the doctrines of the
academy. Gemistus, his first master, had been an avowed disciple
of the Alexandrian school, and in the furious controversy then raging
between the Platonists and the Aristotelians, had highly lauded
not only the writings of the Greek philosopher, but those of Hermes
and Zoroaster. In fact, as Hallam cautiously expresses it, “there
were some grounds for ascribing to him a rejection of Christianity.”
Ficinus cannot be charged with similar scepticism, though his lectures
seem to have sown the seeds of religious doubt in the minds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616"></a>[616]</span>
of some of his hearers. He believed the Gospels, but they were the
Gospels <em>Platonised</em>. He went so far as to desire that his favourite
author should be read in the Christian churches, and published
eighteen books of what he called “Platonic Theology.” Hallam
calls this work “a beautiful, but visionary and hypothetical system
of Theism.” He did not attack the Christian dogmas, but he treated
them as a philosopher rather than as a theologian. He was not
content with gathering up and giving to the world the profound
maxims of his illustrious master; but he undertook to harmonise the
teaching of Plato and the teaching of Scripture, and attempted to
prove that all the most prominent Christian mysteries were to be
found in the <cite>Criton</cite>, which he regarded almost as a second Gospel.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The extravagances in which Ficinus indulged were equally maintained
in other learned academies. That which flourished at Rome
under the direction of Pomponius Lœtus drew on its members the
hostility of Paul II., who has been repeatedly charged with “persecuting
the learned,” out of that natural antipathy to learning, of
which Popes and cardinals are sometimes imagined to possess a kind
of monopoly. The historian who originated the charge, however, is
no other than Platina, the former master of Ficinus, whom Paul II.
had made an enemy by suppressing the college of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abbreviatori</i>
to which he belonged. He was himself a member of the Roman
academy, the suppression of which has been differently related by
different historians, but it appears certain that the alleged crime of
the members was, not their learning, but a real or supposed plot
against the Government and certain impious and anti-Christian tenets
which they were reported to hold. Tiraboschi considers that their
innocence of the charges brought against them may be deduced from
the fact that, after a year’s imprisonment, they were all set at liberty,
and that Platina in particular was afterwards honourably employed
by Sixtus IV., who made him librarian of the Vatican Library.
Possibly the impieties of which they were guilty might rather have
sprung from the foolish conceit of pedants than any positive unbelief;
yet still it must be owned that some of their acts had a suspicious
character, and could not but have appeared reprehensible in the eyes
of the Pontiff. Michael Canensius declares they were wont to affirm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_617"></a>[617]</span>
that the Christian religion rested on no sufficient evidence, but only
on the testimony of a few weak-headed saints: that they laid aside
the use of their Christian names, and adopted others chosen from
the great heathens of antiquity; that they were in the habit of
swearing by the heathen gods and goddesses; that they disputed
concerning the immortality of the soul, and maintained many Platonic
errors, that Pomponius disdained the Scriptures, and was wont
to say that Christianity was only fit for barbarians, and that, in his
enthusiasm for ancient Rome, he even raised and decorated altars to
the god Romulus. Some of these charges the accused did not deny;
but though examined under the torture, it does not seem that anything
transpired which offered satisfactory proofs of the existence of
a conspiracy.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Paul contented himself, therefore, with suppressing
the academy, and thereby earned for himself immense obloquy, and
the character of being an enemy of letters; a most undeserved
reproach, for, besides maintaining a number of poor scholars in his
palace, and being an eager collector of ancient manuscripts and
monuments, his biographer tells us that he was accustomed to spend
many hours of the night reading the ancient authors, and “that he
loved all learned men, <em>provided</em> that to their learning were joined
good manners.” This last condition was not always thought equally
essential by patrons of letters of this period, who seem, as a general
rule, to have cared but little what a man’s life was, provided he knew
Greek. Filelfo, however, adds his testimony (which, in this instance,
may perhaps be regarded as trustworthy), that Paul II. “was ever a
favourer of learned men.”</p>

<p>We must not, however, suppose that the scholars of the Renaissance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_618"></a>[618]</span>
were exclusively made up of captious grammarians and philosophic
sceptics. The movement had its fairer side; it was bewitching
in its promise of literary excellence, and was not even devoid of its
character of romance. Chivalry was not yet entirely extinct, and
among the masters and scholars of the Italian schools some took up
the cause of learning in a truly chivalrous spirit, and without a thought
of self-interest, devoted themselves to study and teaching, as to a
work by which they might benefit their kind. Their enthusiasm for
their favourite pursuits appears sometimes in a more amiable character
than that which it assumed in the hands of Poggio and his
adversaries. Among the grammar professors enumerated by Tiraboschi
we find the name of Piattino de’ Piatti, a noble youth brought
up as a page in the household of Galeazzo Sforza, who for a very
small offence caused him to be imprisoned for fifteen months in a
frightful dungeon. We next find him figuring at a splendid tournament
at the court of Ferrara, where he bore away the prize, and at
the same time struck up an ardent friendship with the poet Strozza,
who addressed some verses to him, praising him for knowing how to
blend together the merits of the soldier and the scholar. For
several years he bore arms under the Duke of Urbino, but his warlike
occupations did not hinder him from cultivating the Muses, and
he published a volume of Latin poems, which was one of the earliest
works printed in Italy. Disappointed at not receiving the promotion
he expected from the French kings Charles VIII. and Louis XII.,
he abandoned the profession of arms, and embraced that of schoolmaster
in the little village of Garlasco, opening his humble academy
with as much solemnity as if it had been a university, with a learned
Latin oration. And we are assured that the number of good scholars
then to be found in Italy was so great that many other villages besides
Garlasco could boast of possessing as their schoolmasters first-rate
professors of eloquence.</p>

<p>But the palm of Christian scholarship belongs, at this time, beyond
all question, to John Picus, Prince of Mirandola, whose brief life
closed in his thirty-second year, and whose acquirements probably
surpassed those recorded of any other scholar. Whilst still a child
he evinced so retentive a memory as to be able at once to repeat
any verses recited in his presence, and displayed a sort of natural
predisposition to the study of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>. His mother, however,
who wished him to embrace the ecclesiastical state, sent him to
Bologna, to read canon law, at the age of fourteen, and after spending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_619"></a>[619]</span>
two years there, he proceeded to study philosophy in the principal
schools of France and Italy. Besides a knowledge of the scholastic
writers, he acquired during the next six years the Latin, Greek,
Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldaic tongues; but his enthusiastic and
imaginative disposition led him to explore with eagerness the mysteries
of the Jewish Cabala, a mass of mystic doctrine attributed to Esdras;
on which idle fallacies, says Corniani, Mirandola expended a genius
which was fitted to reach the most elevated truths of philosophy.</p>

<p>In his twenty-third year the young scholar appeared at Rome, and
astonished the learned world by offering publicly to defend nine
hundred theses on questions logical, ethical, mathematical, physical,
metaphysical, theological, magical, and cabalistic; in short, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de omni
re scibili</i>. Four hundred of these propositions were taken from
Latin, Greek, Jewish, and Arabic doctors; the rest were announced
to be his own opinions, which he was prepared to defend, subject to
the judgment of the Church. There was a dash of vanity in all this,
excusable perhaps in so young a scholar, who could not but be conscious
of his superiority, and who in his anxiety to display it, offered
to pay the expenses of any learned man who might come to oppose
him from the utmost parts of the earth. His propositions were
meanwhile examined by order of Innocent VIII., and thirteen of
them pronounced unsound; whereupon he published an “Apology,”
explaining in what sense they were put forth, but wholly submitting
to the judgment passed on them by authority. The Holy Father,
therefore, while condemning the theses, forbade their author to be in
any way molested, and when some of his enemies revived these
accusations on the death of Innocent, his successor, Alexander VI.,
appointed a commission, which declared his innocence of the charge
of heresy. He next appeared at Florence, the most brilliant of all
the brilliant throng that was gathered in the court of Lorenzo de’
Medici, and was admitted to the closest friendship of that prince,
and his favourite scholars Ficinus and Politian. Young, gifted in
mind and person, and possessed of all the fairy favours of rank,
wealth, and an honourable fame, Picus of Mirandola yielded at first
to the fascinations of the world, which perhaps never assumed a
more bewitching guise than in the court of the Medici. His ardent
poetic temperament was sensitively alive to the seductions of pleasure,
when pleasure came hand in hand with all that was graceful in art
and polished in literature. But a few years of such life sufficed to
withdraw the veil from his eyes; the pursuit after worldly honours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_620"></a>[620]</span>
and delights seemed after all, to use his own words, but a child’s
chase after painted soap-bubbles; and the day came when, flinging
all his lighter poetry into the flames, he prostrated before the altar
of the Blessed Virgin, and vowed to dedicate the remainder of his
life to the service of God alone. From that time he became as
remarkable for his admirable virtues, as he had been before for his
learning; his charities to the poor were dispensed on a princely
scale, and so great a horror did he conceive for the vain glory into
which he had been once betrayed, that he only allowed his writings
to appear under the name of some other author. He refused every
solicitation to engage in public disputations, and spent the remainder
of his days in mingled prayer and study, to which latter exercise,
says Paul Cortese, he generally devoted twelve hours a day.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Picus of Mirandola, though so thoroughly
imbued with the literary tastes of the Renaissance, was very far from
sharing in that contempt for the elder Christian schoolmen, in which
the scholars of the fifteenth century commonly indulged. When
Hermolaus Barbarus, in one of his letters, gave vent to his sentiments
of scorn for men who could write such bad Latin, Picus
replied in an epistle, which Hallam quotes as affording a favourable
example of the ease and elegance of his own style, and in which he
puts a very good defence in the mouth of those despised barbarians;
and Hermolaus had nothing better to say in return than that they
would certainly have disowned their advocate for defending them in
such classical language.</p>

<p>But we must now enter the school of another Florentine canon,
who had the merit not only of being learned in Greek and Latin,
but of possessing some of that original and poetic genius which, since
the days of Petrarch, had been rare in Italy, overlaid, it may be, by
the superincumbent weight of grammar learning. Angelo Politian
had first made himself known to the world of letters by a graceful
poem, composed when a mere youth on the occasion of a tournament,
at which Julian and Lorenzo, the two sons of Pietro de’ Medici,
appeared in the lists. The young poet, scarce fifteen years of age,
was at once received into the Medici Palace, and astonished his
tutors, Landino, Argyrophilus, and Ficinus, with his Latin epigrams.
He was not much older when he undertook to translate Homer into
Latin verse, and at twenty-nine we find him filling the chair of rhetoric
at Florence, a distinction of which he was abundantly vain. Vanity
was, in fact, his prevailing fault, and it raised him a swarm of enemies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621"></a>[621]</span>
who could not forgive his airs of superiority, and those biting sarcasms
which he knew how to clothe in the most elegant Latin. But even
his enemies admitted that, as a professor of eloquence, he stood
without a rival. Equally at home in Greek, Latin, or Hebrew eloquence,
in the Platonic or the Peripatetic philosophy, in rhetoric or
in jurisprudence, he amazed his hearers by the multiplicity of his
acquirements, no less than by the facility of his style. No wonder
that a lecturer of this stamp should succeed in drawing around him
all the great intellects of that wonderful age. On the benches
beneath that chair you might see the young prince Picus of Mirandola,
and the grey-headed men who had been Politian’s own masters; a
crowd of foreigners, too, such as the Englishmen Grocyn and Linacre,
who were destined to carry back the seeds of polite letters to their
own barbaric land, and other pilgrims from France, Germany, and
Portugal, besides native scholars from all the cities of Italy. Lorenzo,
who in 1469 had succeeded to his father’s wealth and dignities,
would also join the learned throng, and hang on the honied words
of the young professor. As every one knows, the Muses are not
always so happy as to carry the Graces in their train, and Politian’s
portrait has been drawn by Jovius in no very flattering terms. On
first beholding him, he says, it was impossible to avoid an involuntary
movement of surprise and disgust; his huge, unsightly nose, squinting
eye, and awkward stoop, inspired no favourable impression; but no
sooner had he begun to speak, than your senses were fairly taken
captive, and closing your eyes, you willingly gave yourself up to the
power of that graceful eloquence and the exquisite music of that
voice, which very soon made you indifferent to the defect of other
natural advantages in the speaker. “Yes,” you might have said to
yourself as you listened, “this is indeed rhetoric; hitherto in that
chair I have listened to grammarians and critics, but the Muses
have at last taken pity on our grammar-beladen ears, and sent us
one who can feel the sentiment of Virgil and Homer, as well as
explain their syntax.”</p>

<p>It was, in fact, the possession of that inexplicable gift, the poetic
sensibility, which raised Politian to an eminence differing so very
widely from that of the Poggios and Vallas who had preceded him,
and which made him more charming as a lecturer, and perhaps more
amiable as a man. Instead of wrangling over verbs and cases, he
loved to picture to his own and his hearers’ imagination, the rural
scenes which Virgil painted; and seizing some happy phrase of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622"></a>[622]</span>
Latin poet, to expand, to colour, to revivify it till you wandered
under the shade of the beech trees, and heard the very hum of the
bees among the odorous limes. At such moments, laying down his
book, with the skill of an Improvisatore, he would take you to the
woods and fields, and make you listen to “the soft and soul-like
sounds” of the wind, as it sighed among the pines, to the rustling
of the oak leaves in Vallombrosa, to the merry chattering of the tiny
brook over its bed of pebbles, and the lowing of the herds in the
rich Tuscan pastures. All this, to the ears of the Florentines, so
long condemned to a sort of intellectual aridity, was like fresh
showers on a thirsty soil. To none was it more delightful than to
Lorenzo, himself a poet of no mean ability, and keenly alive to the
charm of rural sights and rural sounds; and after listening to such
a lecture, he would wait in the hall, and taking the professor by the
arm, would lead him out to that fair villa at Fiesole, which looked
over the dome and towers of Florence, and over a varied landscape
of mountains, woods, and gardens, all glittering in the sunset glories
of a Tuscan sky. There were gathered day after day the choicest
intellects and the most erudite minds, men of all nations and of
all gifts: critics, artists, poets, antiquarians; Lorenzo had a welcome
for each, and was as ready to reward the happy presentee of an
ancient medal or a classic vase, as he was to add to his library a
Greek manuscript brought from the farther end of Europe by
Lascaris,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> or a new treatise from the pen of Landino. Every day
some fresh treasure was displayed to the admiration of his illustrious
friends, some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</i> of ancient sculpture, or a heap of Eastern
manuscripts, sold to him by a Jewish merchant for their weight in
gold. “I love these books so dearly,” he once said, “that I would
give my whole princely wardrobe to purchase them.” The arts were
not forgotten. Perugino was among the honoured guests of Fiesole;
and among the pupils of Politian was the young sculptor Michael
Angelo Buonarotti, whom Lorenzo lodged in his palace, and treated
as his own son. The Platonic academicians, too, found a warm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_623"></a>[623]</span>
supporter in the grandson of their founder, and Ficinus gratified to
the full his thirst for sunshine, and his dreamy poetic tastes in that
little chamber, where morning after morning he loved to throw open
the windows, and listen to the song of the birds as they greeted the
dawn, and drink in the fragrance of the hawthorn and the honeysuckle,
and the thousand exotic plants which blossomed on the
parterres and terraces. There, to use the exquisite similitude of the
English philosopher, “the breath of the flowers in the open air
came and went like the warbling of music;”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> there the fountains
threw up their graceful jets, and made a pleasant murmur to the ear,
and the sensitive and highly-wrought organisation of the Platonic
scholar was soothed and invigorated by contact with all that was
beautiful to the eye and ear in nature or in art.</p>

<p>All this was delightful enough, nor is it to be wondered at that
the grace and fascination of such scenes blinded the eyes of those
who took part in them, and the judgment of those who have been
their historians. But, in truth, there was another side to the picture.
The revival of classic taste at Florence was a revival of practical
Paganism. It was not a mere return to those principles which had
been admitted in the Christian schools before the rise of Scholasticism,
when the Latin poets were freely studied even in ecclesiastical
seminaries, and the Greek learning of the monks of St. Gall earned
for some among them the title of the <em>Frati Ellenici</em>. It was a great
deal more than this. It not only restored the study of the classic
writers, but also their habits of thought, and their gross sensuality.
It revived the Pagan, and excluded the Christian ideas; Christ was
no longer recognised as “the One Teacher of man;” on the contrary,
even from the pulpit you heard quotations from Virgil and Juvenal
quite as often as from the Gospels. A style of speaking had become
fashionable, according to which a certain sort of barbarism was
associated with the idea of Christianity, as though it were something
Gothic and transmontane. The Saints and Fathers of the Church
gradually disappeared from the schools; the touching representations
of Christian mysteries were withdrawn from the public eye; and
society, instead of being permeated, as in former centuries, with an
atmosphere of the faith, was now redolent of heathenism. Christianity
was looked on as unworthy of furnishing subjects to the pen
or pencil of the scholar. In those trellised gardens where the wits
of Florence assembled to listen to the graceful eloquence of Politian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_624"></a>[624]</span>
were grouped fragments of ancient art or the copies of modern
sculptors, the eager students of the new school of naturalism. Here
it was an undraped Venus, there a Satyr or a Bacchanal. Sometimes
Lorenzo appeared among the brilliant throng, and condescended
to assign to the artists whom he entertained a new subject for their
genius. To Pollajuolo he gave the twelve labours of Hercules, to
Ghirlandajo the misfortunes of Vulcan, to Luca Signorelli all the
gods and goddesses of Olympus, whose stories were to be represented
with little of that reserve demanded by Christian modesty. Yet
artists might have been found at that time whose genius was impressed
with a more religious character, but they received no
encouragement at Florence, where the school most in favour was
that which substituted sensual for mystic beauty; and this debased
heathenised taste equally pervaded the Florentine literature and
schools.</p>

<p>The books admitted as class-books into the new academies were
precisely those authors which have been in all ages proscribed as the
most dangerous, but which were now placed in the hands of the
young without restriction of any sort. And, indeed, what kind of
moral safeguards were likely to be supplied by professors such as
Filelfo, Poggio, and Valla, whose licentious language was unhappily
rather the rule than the exception among the teachers of the day?
The study of the Scriptures, which in earlier times had filled so large
a place in the scholastic course, was now all but entirely laid aside;
and we are assured that some would even ask, with astonishing
simplicity, what use could be derived from the knowledge of events
that had happened so many ages ago? As to that liturgical element
which had hitherto mingled so largely in the scheme of Christian
education, it had little chance of being preserved in an age when not
lay professors alone, but even ecclesiastics, were so besotted with
their devotion to Pagan models, as to show themselves ashamed of
the language of the Church formularies. Whilst some escaped from
the misery of reciting their Latin breviaries by obtaining permission
to use a Greek or Hebrew version, others gave up reading the
Epistles of St. Paul through fear of accustoming their ears to so
unclassical a style; and numerous proposals were set on foot for
what was called a reform of the Liturgy, which should have for its
object the correction of its style and its adaptation to classical forms.
But even these were not the worst excesses. Tiraboschi assures us
that scepticism and open unbelief were becoming frightfully common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625"></a>[625]</span>
among men of letters, and specially in the Italian universities which
were declared in the following century to be hot-beds of infidelity.
Yet so innate in the human soul is the craving for some kind of
mysticism, that at the very time that faith in the Christian mysteries
was being rejected, many were entangling themselves in the absurdities
of the Jewish Cabala; and not a few addicted themselves to
magical studies, practising rites and incantations of most shocking
impiety. Even where these grosser disorders did not exist, the
combined <ins class="corr" id="tn625" title="Transcriber’s Note—“inflnence of heathenism and sensuality” changed to “influence of heathenism and sensuality”.">influence of heathenism and sensuality</ins>
produced a certain irreligious and intensely worldly tone, more
difficult, perhaps, to combat than open vice or infidelity; and it
was of this that Savonarola complained when from the pulpit of St.
Mark’s he first addressed the Florentines with his fervid Biblical
eloquence, but found his glowing words fall, as he expressed it, upon
hearts as hard and as cold as marble.</p>

<p>In other respects, also, the age of the Medici resembled but too
closely that of Augustus. It was an age when a people were being
cajoled to surrender their freedom into the hands of an absolute ruler,
who used as his instrument for undermining republican institutions
weapons far more deadly than the sword. Lorenzo had read Tacitus
to some purpose, and thoroughly understood his maxim, that the
easiest way to enslave a nation is first to corrupt it. He scrupled
not to secure his political ascendancy in Florence by ministering to
the baser passions of the populace. He amused them with shows
and dances, carnival masquerades, and midnight processions, in which
the flood-gates of license were freely opened, and heathen fables were
represented in all their most unseemly crudeness; and in return they
let him steal away their independence, and appropriate to himself
the authority of the sovereign of Florence under the title of her First
Citizen. Magnificent orgies were held by torchlight, wherein the
triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne, or some other such subject, was
enacted by bands of superbly-dressed masquers, singing those celebrated
carnival songs composed by Lorenzo, which were, we are told,
for the most part, immoral and indecent, expressing, not the graceful
Platonism of a classical academy, but a mythological burlesque,
flavoured for the grosser tastes of the populace.</p>

<p>It was against this flood of iniquity in the schools, the palace, and
the public streets, that the bold eloquence of Savonarola was at this
time directed, creating a moral reaction, which proved, however
fallacious in its brilliant promise of reform. Taking the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626"></a>[626]</span>
as his weapon of warfare, he dealt rude and terrible blows at those
who were sapping the very foundations of Christianity with their
elegant Paganism. He complained that priests and doctors now
thought of nothing but rhetoric. They studied Horace and Cicero
to prepare themselves for the cure of souls. They gave up the study
of the Scriptures in order to preach Plato from the pulpit. The
very art and music which they encouraged were instruments of
demoralisation rather than of popular instruction. Most terrible was
the eloquence with which he attacked the authors of such abuses.
“How have <em>you</em> renounced the Devil and his pomps?” he exclaimed
in one of his sermons&mdash;“you, who every day do his works, and attend
not to the law of Christ, but the literature of the Gentiles; declaring
the Scriptures to contain only food fit for women, and demanding in
their place the eloquence of Tully and the sounding words of the
poets to be preached to you!” On no subject were his strictures
more unsparing than on the education of the young. He built his
hopes of reform not on his grown-up hearers and converts; but on
the children, for whose benefit he sought to introduce a system of
studies, the principles of which in the main coincided with those of
the ancient Christian schools. He did not propose the exclusion of
the heathen poets and philosophers, but demanded that no lesson in
Pagan literature should be given without a simultaneous one from
Christian sources; that the Scriptures should be ever in the hand of
the professor; that St. Jerome and St. Augustine should be studied
together with Homer and Cicero; that no book of immoral tendency
should be tolerated in the schools; and that teachers should not fail
to point out to their pupils the folly and impiety of the heathen
fables.</p>

<p>Savonarola had the satisfaction of effecting not a few conversions
among the men of letters who gathered round his pulpit. Ficinus
became his warm apologist, and after listening to his sermons declared
his intention of devoting the rest of his life to religion. Nicholas of
Schomberg and Zenobius Acciajoli abandoned the world, and assumed
the Dominican habit. Picus Mirandola sold all his estates and
distributed the price to the poor, and even Politian on his death-bed
received the habit of religion from the hand of one of his friars.
But whatever were the success gained by the preacher among the
Florentine courtiers, his eloquence was powerless over the mind of
their master. Lorenzo and Savonarola each tried to gain the other,
and each was doomed to suffer defeat. Lorenzo vainly tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627"></a>[627]</span>
corrupt or silence an orator who was equally indifferent to threats or
bribes; and when the prince lay on his death-bed, Savonarola, as
vainly, strove to wring from him a promise to restore her liberties
to Florence. After his death, indeed, which took place in 1492, a
brilliant triumph seemed to crown the hopes of the popular friar, and
under his leadership, Florence, having expelled the Medici, seemed
about to exchange her debased republicanism for a theocracy, and
her free life of pleasure for an almost puritanic severity of manners.
But the tide of social corruption which had for a moment been thus
forcibly dammed up, soon burst the barrier that opposed it, and swept
away all traces of the seeming reform, the reformer himself being
the first victim of its fury. Those very streets of Florence which
had witnessed the Medicean carnival shows, and where a little later
the Florentines, under the direction of their republican chief, had
made solemn acts of reparation for past license, now saw the reformer
himself borne to ignominious execution amid the howls and blasphemies
of an infuriated populace.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the Medici from Florence in no way checked the
progress of the classical Renaissance, which only attained its full
growth in the following generation. To the age of Lorenzo the
Magnificent succeeded that of his son Pope Leo X., under whose
princely rule Rome drew to herself the literary throngs who had before
illuminated the Tuscan court, and rejoiced in the questionable glories
of a second Augustan age. But of Rome and her Pontiffs, her garish
splendour and her true reform, we shall speak in another chapter.
Before doing so we must first look across the Alps, and see what has
been going on in the world of letters in the colder climate of the
North.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not to be supposed that the development which had been taken
by the universities, and which we have been engaged in tracing in
the foregoing chapters, the perils to which their younger members
were exposed, and the yet graver results that might be expected to
ensue to faith and morals if their influence continued without some
salutary check, could fail, even in their own day, of attracting the
attention of thoughtful men; and much curious illustration might be
drawn from the literature of the fourteenth century, tending to show
how questionable a place the great academies of learning at that time
held in popular estimation. The most racy legends of mediæval
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diablerie</i> generally introduce us to some student of Paris or Salamanca,
who has made a compact with the enemy of souls; while the graver
histories of the saints are crowded with examples of those who fled
into the cloister to escape the contagion of the schools.</p>

<p>The danger to which the scholastic convertites seem to have been
most sensitively alive was not one, perhaps, which, to modern
notions, would seem the most appalling. It was not the licentious
manners, nor even precisely the heterodox opinions of the schools,
which chiefly terrified them, but the subtle perils of intellectual
vanity. It has been before remarked that, among the old monastic
scholars, the existence of this danger was hardly recognised. The
obligations of their state for the most part protected them from its
attacks. “What they learnt without guile they communicated without
envy,”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> and they believed and practically set forth the doctrine
which, as one of modern times has beautifully expressed it, acknowledges
“humility, the basis of morals, to be also the foundation of
reason.” So entirely did the rules of holy living purge the pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_629"></a>[629]</span>
of science from the leaven of pride, that it is quite common to find
ancient writers speaking of learning as though it were almost a
virtue. Things had sadly changed in this respect since the close of
the tenth century, and the warnings which St. Bernard addressed to
the scholars of his day had to be repeated by the ascetics of each
successive age with ever-increasing earnestness. He sorrowfully
lamented that those who pursued learning were daily more and more
losing sight of its right <em>order</em>, its right <em>motive</em>, and its right <em>end</em>.
The order of true knowledge, he said, is to set in the first rank the
things that concern salvation; its motive should be charity, and its
end, neither curiosity nor vain-glory, but our own or our neighbour’s
edification. And he failed not to remind the would-be philosophers
whom he addressed, and whose chief object seemed to be to make
themselves talked about, that the “biting tooth” of the Latin satirist
had long before drawn their portraits, and ridiculed those who only
care to know in order that somebody else may know that they know.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
The evils he complained of had certainly not abated with time;
nevertheless, the old Christian morality, which was so based on intellectual
lowliness as to be hardly capable of realising a fear of the
opposite vice until it arose before the eye in all its deformity, was
too deeply rooted in Christendom to be eradicated by one or two
generations of professors; and its influence may be traced in the
horror which good men felt and expressed for what they regarded as
a more radical poison than the grosser temptations of an undisciplined
life. And we who have witnessed the later issues of that great
Revolt of Reason which took its beginnings in the pride of intellect,
and which will find its end in the reign of Antichrist, are bound to
bear witness that they judged aright, and to applaud a sagacity which
originated less perhaps in any very quick-sighted intelligence than in
the undulled instincts of the Christian sense.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we represent to ourselves the learned world of
the Middle Ages crowding to the universities that were starting up in
almost every provincial capital of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain,
we must not forget that a quiet undercurrent was always flowing in
an opposite direction, though it had no power to overcome the strong
full tide of fashion. Thus, the life of the Blessed Peter Jeremias, of
the Order of Preachers, presents us with the picture of the student of
Bologna about to read for his doctor’s degree, when, one night as
he sits at his books, the window of his room is dashed in, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_630"></a>[630]</span>
voice of one of his fellow-students, recently departed, warns him in
terrible accents to renounce those academic honours, in the greedy
pursuit of which he had lost his immortal soul. Peter, pierced to
the soul by this voice from beyond the grave, abandons his intention
of reading for honours, and presents himself the next morning at the
gates of the Dominican Convent to implore admission among the
friars. And it was to another conversion of this sort, somewhat less
pictorial in its colouring, that we owe the foundation of a very
remarkable religious institute, too closely associated with the history
of education to be left unnoticed here.</p>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1360 there appeared at Paris a young
Flemish student named Gerard, a native of the town of Deventer,
whose success in every branch of study acquired him no mean
fame in academic circles, and inflated him with a corresponding
degree of vanity. He took his master’s degree in his eighteenth
year, received several rich benefices, began a very pompous and
expensive way of life, and at last removed to Cologne, less to study
than to display and enjoy himself. There, however, he found his
fate awaiting him. It was the precise period when a great spiritual
reaction was going on in Rhenish Germany: not twenty years before
Cologne had witnessed the conversion of the celebrated John Tauler,
whose pride of learning had yielded to the simple word of a nameless
unlettered layman, and who spent the rest of his life in preaching
those doctrines of self-abnegation on which he built the edifice of
the spiritual life. Ruysbroek, the greatest contemplative of his time,
was still living in the Green Valley of the forest of Soignies, and
training many a fervid soul in the mystic science which aimed at
uniting man to God by utterly separating him from creatures. It
was probably one of these disciples of Ruysbroek, a religious solitary,
whose name, like that of Tauler’s “layman,” has not been preserved,
who determined to undertake the conversion of the gay young canon,
in whom, despite his vanity and his love of the world, he detected
the promise of more excellent things.</p>

<p>The biographer of Gerard has told the story of his conversion
briefly enough, and compressed the arguments of the orator into one
brief sentence, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid hic stas, vanis intentus? Alius homo fieri debes.</i>
And another man Gerard indeed became. He flung the world behind
his back, and entered on a life of penance with no less ardour than
that with which he had applied himself awhile before to the business
of the schools. For three years he retired among the Carthusians and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_631"></a>[631]</span>
wholly disappeared from the world; and when he returned there was
little of the old Gerard about him. He at once devoted himself to
the work of preaching, and generally preached twice a day, his
sermons being seldom less than three hours in length. But it was
difficult to weary a German congregation of that enthusiastic period,
and no complaints appear to have been made of Gerard’s prolixity.
During his retirement he had placed himself under the direction of
Ruysbroek, and appears to have caught much of his tone and spirit.
He had made the Scriptures his only study, and these, expounded
with simple eloquence from earnest lips, drew him crowds of hearers,
“clergy and laity, men and women, little and great, learned and
unlearned, lawyers and magistrates, bond and free, rich and poor,
beggars and pilgrims.” He laid the axe to the root of the tree,
and like St. John Baptist, called on all men to do worthy works of
penance. In short, he gave the age what it wanted, and though he
met with many contradictions, he also effected many practical
reforms.</p>

<p>Gerard the Great, as he was called, soon reckoned a considerable
number of disciples, whom he made it his chief object to ground in
the spiritual life; and in spite of his renown as one of the most
learned doctors of his time, he thoroughly inculcated the lesson of
intellectual humility. Out of the ranks of his followers was gradually
formed a sort of fraternity or congregation; and he had conceived
the design of founding for their reception certain monasteries under
the rule of the Canons Regular, in which purpose he was greatly
encouraged by Ruysbroek. Gerard died before he was able to put
his plans into execution, but they were carried out by his disciples,
and specially by Master Florentius Radewyns, a canon of Utrecht, a
former student at the university of Prague. The new religious
assumed the title of “Brethren of the Common Life;” their mother-house
was at Deventer, they lived like monks, though without at first
taking the religious vows, and their employment was the correction
and transcription of books, which formed their principal source of
revenue. Gerard, in the rule he had drawn up for his own guidance,
had prohibited all profane studies. He desired that his children
should exclusively addict themselves to the reading of the Scriptures
and the Fathers, not wasting their time over “such vanities as
geometry, arithmetic, rhetoric, logic, grammar, lyric poetry, and
judicial astrology.” In the rigorism of these views we detect the
spirit of one who has tasted of a poisoned cup, and knows no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632"></a>[632]</span>
security than a rule of total abstinence. He specially forbids all
gainful studies, which obscure and obliquify the human reason, and
do not tend to God; and he roundly asserts that very few persons
who follow the pursuits of law or medicine are ever found who live
a just, honest, and quiet life. No doubt his principles were extreme,
and it is some consolation to find that he admitted of certain dispensations.
The wiser of the Gentile philosophers, such as Plato and
Socrates, might, he admitted, be read with profit. Seneca also was
to be tolerated, and with an amiable inconsistency we find him,
even in his rule of life, slipping in, half unconsciously, a quotation
from Virgil.</p>

<p>All this was exactly what might have been expected from a converted
man of the world; but Florentius had gone through a
different kind of experience, and one which made his views less
austere and exclusive. He had passed the ordeal of a university
career unscathed, and his biographer expends an entire chapter in
bringing forward proofs why the name he bore was specially appropriate
to one whose life from childhood had been so holy and unspotted.
Not only was he himself a flower of all perfection, but he
was also destined to make the houses he governed flower-beds from
which spiritual bees were to suck the honey of wisdom; his brethren
were to give out to a naughty world the sweet odour of virtue,
according to that of the Spouse in the Canticles, “The flowers have
appeared in our land.” Florentius was the model of a good scholar,
kind to his equals, respectful to his superiors, a proficient in the
liberal arts, but keeping his heart for the Divine law, which he loved
and studied far more diligently than he did the book of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>Under his superiority the labours of the brethren were made to
embrace a larger sphere of usefulness, and to include the education
of youth. The prohibition against profane learning speedily disappeared,
and the schools of Deventer attained high celebrity; and
there, in 1393, a little scholar, Thomas Hammerlein by name, was
admitted under the roof of Florentius, becoming afterwards the
biographer of his revered master, and the reputed author of the
“Following of Christ.”</p>

<p>Not to enter into the vexed question whether he were indeed the
author, or only the transcriber, of that first of uninspired books, it is
yet satisfactory to know that the Thomas à Kempis, whom from
infancy we have been used to revere, is not reduced by the investigations
of ruthless critics to a mere mythical existence. He <ins class="corr" id="tn632" title="Transcriber’s Note—“reaby lived, wrote, taught, and prayed” changed to “really lived, wrote, taught, and prayed”.">really lived, wrote, taught, and prayed</ins>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633"></a>[633]</span>
In the college of Deventer he studied grammar and plain-chant
under Florentius, and tells us how, when present in choir with his
schoolfellows, he loved stealthily to watch his master, because of
his devout aspect, being cautious, however, that his pious curiosity
was not perceived, inasmuch as the good rector could make himself
feared as well as loved. He takes us into the school, too, and shows
us the master setting copies, and praising the flexible fingers of
a little disciple, whom, with the blessing of God, he hopes to form
into a good writer. Or we enter the cell of the devout brother,
Gerard of Zutphen, whose whole consolation lay in holy books, and who
was liable to get so absorbed in the study of them, that a charitable
brother had to come and warn him when the bell had rung for dinner.
He was the librarian, and had a passing great care for his books; but
as for himself and his corporeal wants, if superiors and companions
had not seen to them better than he did himself, he would have fared
but poorly. He thought so highly of the benefits to be derived from
useful reading, that he lent his books to ecclesiastics out of doors,
to win them from idle and frivolous amusements. “Books,” he would
say, “preach better than we can do.” And therefore he held them in
great reverence, read them lovingly, and copied them with the utmost
diligence. Nor must we omit to mention the pious cook, John Ketel,
the saint of the community, as all, by common consent, seem to have
regarded him. Florentius knew his merit, and to increase it never
gave him a civil word; but his humility and sweetness were proof
against every trial. Or that devout clerk, Arnold Schoonhove, a
schoolfellow of Thomas, who never played in the streets with other
idle boys, and when he sat in school with them heeded not their
childish pranks, but steadily wrote down the master’s words on paper,
and got a chosen comrade (who was probably Thomas himself) to read
over the lesson to him, or hear him repeat it. “It was God whom he
chiefly sought in his studies,” says his friend, “and what he liked
best was to get into a quiet corner and pray.” After seven years’
study among the Brethren of Common Life, Thomas took the habit of
the Canons Regular in the monastery of St. Agnes, at Zwoll, where
he lived till his ninety-second year, engaged in useful labours,
transcribing and composing pious books, which earned for him the
sobriquet of the Hammer of Hearts. He has left us memorials of his
monastery and his college-life, written with a sweet simplicity
which reminds us of Bede. Of his own life we know but little, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634"></a>[634]</span>
that little has a character of its own. His world was his cell; he
was never quite happy out of it, and if sometimes induced by his
brethren to go abroad and take a little air, he would soon contrive
to get away, with the transparent excuse, that “Some one was
waiting for him in his chamber.” The others would smile, knowing
well Who He was of Whom he spoke, even the Beloved, of Whom
it is written that He stands at the door and knocks. In all the
books that he transcribed he wrote his favourite motto, “Everywhere
I sought for rest, but I found it nowhere save in a little corner, with
a little book.” And a certain old and much-defaced picture was
long preserved, which represented his effigies surrounded with the
legend, which must here be added in its original phraseology:&mdash;“In
omnibus requiem quæsivi, sed non inveni, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi in Hoexkins ende
Boexkins</i>.”</p>

<p>In process of time the Brethren of Common Life spread over
Flanders, France, and Germany, and the schools they founded
multiplied and flourished. They were introduced into the University
of Paris by John Standonch, a doctor of the Sorbonne, who
gave into their direction the College de Montaigu, of which he was
the principal, and established them in Cambray, Valenciennes,
Mechlin, and Louvain. He drew up statutes for their use, which are
supposed by Du Boulay to have furnished St. Ignatius with the
first notions of his rule, an idea which receives some corroboration
from the fact that the saint studied at the College de Montaigu
during his residence at the University of Paris. Standonch himself
received the habit of the Poor Clerks, as they were now often called,
and had the satisfaction of seeing more than 300 good scholars
issue from his schools, many of whom undertook the direction or
reform of other academies. In 1430 the Institute numbered forty-five
houses, and thirty years later the numbers were increased threefold.
The Deventer brethren were far from being mere mystics and
transcribers of books. The aim of their foundation was doubtless
to supply a system of education which should revive something of
the old monastic discipline, but they cultivated all the higher
branches of learning, and their schools were among the first of those
north of the Alps which introduced the revived study of classical
literature. One of their most illustrious scholars was Nicholas of
Cusa, or Cusanus, the son of a poor fisherman, who won his doctor’s
cap at Padua, and became renowned for his Greek, Hebrew, and
mathematical learning. Eugenius IV. appointed him his legate, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_635"></a>[635]</span>
Nicholas V. created him Cardinal and Bishop of Brixen, in the
Tyrol. His personal character won him the veneration of his people,
but, according to Tennemann, his love of mathematics led him into
many theological extravagances. He was strongly inclined to the
views of the Neo-Platonists; he considered, moreover, that all
human knowledge was contained in the ideas of numbers, and
attempted to explain the mystery of the Holy Trinity on mathematical
principles. He was undoubtedly a distinguished man of
science, and was the first among moderns to revive the Pythagorean
hypothesis of the motion of the earth round the sun. Cusanus had
studied at most of the great universities, but held none of them in
great esteem, for he professed a sovereign contempt for the scholastic
philosophy which still held its ground in those academies. At
his death he left his wealth to an hospital which he had founded
in his native village, and to which he attached a magnificent library.
Deventer could boast indeed of being the fruitful mother of great
scholars, such as Hegius, Langius, and Dringeberg, all of whom
afterwards took part in the restoration of letters. The brethren,
moreover, displayed extraordinary zeal in promoting the new art of
printing, and one of the earliest Flemish presses was set up in their
college. And in 1475, when Alexander Hegius became rector of
the schools, he made the first bold experiment of printing Greek.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that such a revolution as that which was
brought about in the world of letters by the new invention could
fail of producing events of a mixed character of good and evil.
Whatever was fermenting in the minds of the people now found
expression through the press, and Hallam notices “the incredible
host of popular religious tracts poured forth” before the close of the
fifteenth century, most of them of a character hostile to the faith.
The first censorship of printed books appears to have been established
in 1480, by Berthold, Archbishop of Mentz, who explained
his reasons for taking this step in a mandate, wherein he complains
of the abuse of the “divine art” of printing, whereby perverse men
have turned that to the injury of mankind which was designed for
their instruction. Specially he alludes to those unauthorised and
faulty translations into the vulgar tongue of the Scriptures, and even
the canons of the Church, wherein men of no learning or experience
have taken on them to invent new words or use old ones in erroneous
senses, in order to express the meaning of the original, “a
thing most dangerous in the Sacred Scriptures.” He therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636"></a>[636]</span>
forbids any such translations to be thenceforward published without
being approved by four doctors, under pain of excommunication,
desiring that the art which was first of all discovered in his city,
“not without divine aid,” should be maintained in all its honour.</p>

<p>This mandate was only directed against the faulty translations of
the Holy Scriptures. No opposition was offered to the multiplication
of correct versions, both of the Latin Vulgate and its various translations.
The Cologne Bible, printed in 1479, had before this appeared,
with the formal approbation of the university. The very first book
printed by Gutenburg and Fust in 1453, was the Latin Bible, and
among the twenty-four books printed in Germany before the year
1470 we find five Latin and two German editions of the Bible.
Translations of the Holy Scriptures into various modern tongues
were among the very first books issued from the press; as the Bohemian
version in 1475, Italian in 1471&mdash;which ran through eleven
editions before the close of the century, the Dutch in 1477, and the
French in the same year. The admirers of Luther have therefore
fallen into a strange error, when they represent him as the first to
unlock the Scriptures to the people, for twenty-four editions of the
German Bible alone had been printed and published before his
time.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1476 that a little choir-boy of Utrecht entered
the college of Deventer, and gave such signs of genius and industry
as to draw from his masters the prediction that he would one day be
the light of his age. He was a namesake of the founder, but, after
the fashion of the day, adopted a Latin and Greek version of his
Flemish name of Gerard, and was to be known to posterity as Desiderius
Erasmus. Like Thomas à Kempis, he passed from the schools
of Deventer to the cloisters of the Canons Regular, a step which, he
assures us, was forced on him by his guardians, and never had his
own assent. A happy accident enabled him to visit Rome in the
suite of the Bishop of Cambray and once released from the wearisome
discipline of convent life, he never returned to it, but spent
the rest of his life wandering from one to another of the capitals of
France, Italy, and England, teaching for a livelihood, courted by all
the literary and religious parties of the day, and satirising them all by
turns, indisputably the literary Coryphæus of his age, but penetrated
through and through with its scoffing and presumptuous spirit. It
was an age fruitful in pedants and humanists, whose destiny it was
to help on the revolution in faith by a revolution in letters. Schools<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_637"></a>[637]</span>
and professors multiplied throughout Germany. At the very time
when Hegius was teaching the elements of Greek to Erasmus, his
old comrades Langius and Dringeberg were presiding over the
schools of Munster and Schelstadt. Rodolph Langius exerted himself
strenuously in the cause of polite letters, and whilst superintending
his classes occupied spare moments in correcting the text of almost
every Latin work which at that time issued from the press, and in
making deadly war on the scholastic philosophy. His rejection of
the old-fashioned school-books and his innovations on time-honoured
abuses raised against him the friars of Cologne, and a controversy
ensued in which Langius won so much success as enabled him to
affix the stigma of barbarism on his opponents. His friend and
namesake Rodolph Agricola, who had studied at Ferrara under
Theodore of Gaza, and was held by his admirers superior in erudition
to Politian himself, at this time presided over the school of Groningen.
Besides his skill in the learned tongues he was a poet, a
painter, a musician, an orator, and a philosopher. Such a multitude
of accomplishments won him an invitation to the court of the
Elector Palatine at Heidelberg, where a certain learned academy had
been founded, called the Rhenish Society, for the encouragement of
Greek and Hebrew literature, the members of which, says Hallam,
“did not scorn to relax their minds with feasting and dancing, not
forgetting the ancient German attachment to the flowing cup.”
This is a polite way of rendering a very ugly passage, which in the
original tells us plainly that the Rhenish academicians were addicted
to excessive inebriety and other disgraceful vices. It is somewhat
remarkable, however, that Agricola, who died three years after his
removal to Heidelberg, received on his death-bed the habit of those
very friars whom, during life, he and his friend Langius had done
their best to hold up to popular contempt.</p>

<p>About the same time Reuchlin was studying at Paris, where, in
1458, Gregory of Tiferno had been appointed Greek professor.
Reuchlin visited Rome, and translated a passage from Thucydides
in the presence of Argyrophilus, with such success that the Greek
exclaimed, in a transport of delight (and possibly of surprise, at such
an achievement on the part of a Northern barbarian), “Our banished
Greece has flown beyond the Alps!” Reuchlin was a Hebrew
scholar, a circumstance which, in the end, proved his ruin; for,
embracing the Cabalistic philosophy, he abandoned classics and good
sense in the pursuit of that absurd mysticism. In this strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638"></a>[638]</span>
infatuation he had many companions. Not a few of those who had
shown themselves foremost in deriding the scholastic philosophy,
ended by substituting in its place either open scepticism or the philosophy
of magic. A few years later, the wild theories of Cornelius
Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Jerome Cardan, found eager adherents
among those who conceived it a proof of good scholarship to despise
St. Thomas as a Goth. Reuchlin, whilst pouring forth his bitter
satires against the old theologians, was printing his treatise on the
Cabala, entitled <cite>De Verbo Mirifico</cite>, wherein magic is declared to be
the perfection of philosophy, which work was formally condemned at
Rome. However, all the French savants of the Renaissance were
not Cabalists, nor did all, when they introduced the study of Greek,
forget that it was the language of the Gospels. The real restoration
of Greek studies in France must be ascribed to Budæus, who made
up, by the piety and indefatigable studies of his later years, for a
youth of wild irregularity. He had studied under Lascaris, and
though he had reached a very mature age before he devoted himself
to letters, he soon became as familiar with the learned tongues as
with his native idiom. His treatise on the Ancient Money first
rendered his name famous, and secured him the friendship of Francis
I. He profited from the favour shown him by that monarch, to
solicit from him the foundation of the Royal College of France, for
the cultivation of the three learned tongues, and thus fairly introduced
the “Cecropian Muse” into the University of Paris. If we may
credit the authority of a grave rector of that university, this momentous
change was advantageous, not merely to the minds but also to
the morals of her students. St. Jerome, as we know, imposed upon
himself the study of Hebrew as an efficacious means of taming the
passions; and Rollin affirms that many who, in former years, had
been nothing but idle men of pleasure, when once they began to
read the Greek authors flung their vices and follies to the winds, and
led the simple and austere manner of life that becomes a scholar.
He quotes a passage from the manuscript Memoirs of Henry de
Mesmes, which gives a pleasant picture of the college life of those
days, and may be taken as an example of the sort of labour imposed
on a hard-working law student of the sixteenth century:&mdash;“My
father,” he says, “gave me for a tutor John Maludan of Limoges, a
pupil of the learned Durat, who was chosen for the innocence of his
life and his suitable age to preside over my early years, till I should
be old enough to govern myself. With him and my brother, John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639"></a>[639]</span>
James de Mesmes, I was sent to the college of Burgundy, and was
put into the third class and I afterwards spent almost a year in the
first. My father said he had two motives for thus sending me to
the college: the one was the cheerful and innocent conversation of
the boys, and the other was the school discipline, by which he trusted
that we should be weaned from the over-fondness that had been
shown us at home, and purified, as it were, in fresh water. Those
eighteen months I passed at college were of great service to me. I
learnt to recite, to dispute, and to speak in public; and I became
acquainted with several excellent men, many of whom are still living.
I learned, moreover, the frugality of the scholar’s life, and how to
portion out my day to advantage; so that, by the time I left, I had
repeated, in public, abundance of Latin, and two thousand Greek
verses, which I had written after the fashion of boys of my age, and
I could repeat Homer from one end to the other. I was thus well
received by the chief men of my time, to some of whom my tutor
introduced me. In 1545, I was sent to Toulouse with my tutor and
brother, to study law under an old grey-haired professor, who had
travelled half over the world. There we remained for three years,
studying severely, and under such strict rules as I fancy few persons
nowadays would care to comply with. We rose at four, and, having
said our prayers, went to lectures at five, with our great books under
our arms, and our inkhorns and candlesticks in our hands. We
attended all the lectures until ten o’clock, without intermission;
then we went to dinner, after having hastily collated during half an
hour what our master had written down. After dinner, by way of
diversion, we read Sophocles, or Aristophanes, or Euripides, and
sometimes Demosthenes, Tully, Virgil, and Horace. At one we
were at our studies again, returning home at five to repeat and turn
to the places quoted in our books till past six. Then came supper,
after which we read some Greek or Latin author. On feast days we
heard mass and vespers, and the rest of the day we were allowed a
little music and walking. Sometimes we went to see our friends,
who invited us much oftener than we were permitted to go. The
rest of the day we spent in reading, and we generally had with us
some learned men of that time.”</p>

<p>We have the satisfaction of knowing that the frugal and laborious
training of Henry’s early life was the means of forming a manly and
Christian character. Nor is the portrait less pleasing which the
biographer of Budæus has left us of the domestic life of that great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640"></a>[640]</span>
man, who, though he had visited the court of Leo X., in quality of
ambassador of France, and was the chief lion of the French world
of letters, retained to his dying day those simple tastes and habits,
which we are assured resulted from no affectation of laconic manners,
but a certain genuine sentiment of humility.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> His secretary and
constant fellow-labourer was his wife, who sat in his study, found out
passages in his books of reference, copied his papers, and withal did
not forget his domestic comfort. Budæus needed some such good
angel by his side, for he belonged to that class of scholars who are
more familiar with the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">As</i> than with the value of louis d’ors.
His mind was in his books, and whilst busy with the doings of the
Greeks and Romans he could not always call home his absent
thoughts. It is to be regretted, that with a character in many
respects so amiable, Budæus should have permitted his love of
Greek to lead him to take part with the Humanists in the ferocious
onslaughts which they directed against the adherents of the mediæval
learning. It was surely possible to revive the study of Homer and
Cicero with rejecting the philosophy of St. Thomas, nor did there
seem any reason why the lovers of polite literature should seek to
establish their fame as scholars by savage and unseemly pasquinades
on their literary rivals. And here it may be remarked that the title
of <em>Humanists</em>, applied to the rising school, was one of their own
choosing. By it they intended at one and the same time to indicate
themselves as the only cultivators of “humane” letters, and to imply
that the professors of the old school were barbarians. They were
not content with advocating good Latin, and reviving the study of
Greek; no one could join their camp who was not ready to rail at
monks and schoolmen as offensive idiots. The former, in the choice
vocabulary of Luther, were “locusts, caterpillars, frogs, and lice,”
the latter, in the more polished phraseology of Budæus, “prating
sophists,” and “divines of the Sorbonian Lake,” “Monks,” says
Erasmus (himself an apostate canon<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>), “are only acceptable to silly
women, bigots, and blockheads.” The Dominicans had the audacity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_641"></a>[641]</span>
to protest against the freedoms he had taken with the Latin Vulgate,
and to complain of his version as that of a poet and orator rather
than of a divine. “Most men who know anything of the value of a
poet,” replies Erasmus, “think <em>you</em> to be swine rather than men,
when they hear your stupid raving. Poetry is so little known to you,
that you cannot even spell its name;<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> but let me tell you, it would
be easier to cut two <em>Thomists</em> out of a log of wood, than one tolerable
orator.” No matter what were a man’s talents, or how reasonable
were his arguments, the moment he opened his mouth in opposition
to these writers, he was placarded as a dunce. Erasmus, in his new
Version of the Greek Testament, had given just cause of complaint
by his use of a phraseology more elegant than theological. A certain
Franciscan friar ventured to object in particular to his rendering of
the Magnificat, whereupon Erasmus vented his spleen in a Colloquy,
and branded the critic as “a pig and a donkey; more of a donkey
than all donkeys put together;” and proceeded to justify his translation
by quoting the comedies of Terence. Standish, Bishop of St.
Asaph, took exception to another blot in the new version, the
substitution, namely, of the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sermo</i>, for that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbum</i>, in the
first chapter of St. John’s Gospel; and Erasmus and his friends considered
that they sufficiently vindicated their good Latin by nicknaming
the objector, the <em>Bishop of St. Ass</em>. In the same style of wit,
Vincent the Dominican was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bucentum</i> the ox-driver, and the Carmelites
were commonly designated the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Camelites</i>. “I have hopes of
Cochlæus,” writes Luther, speaking of some of his adversaries, “he is
only an idiot; as for the other two, they belong to the devil.” This
was the ordinary style of the humanist controversialists; their puns
and sarcasms being, in most cases, accompanied with a shower
of mud.</p>

<p>With these, however, we need not more particularly concern
ourselves, but turn our glance on Louvain, where, in the early part
of the century, a new university had arisen, under Duke John of
Brabant, which received its first diploma from Pope Martin V. in
1425, the theological faculty being erected six years later by Eugenius
IV. The latter Pontiff had the satisfaction of receiving the firmest
support from the Louvain doctors during the troublous times of the
Council of Basle; and during the following century Louvain continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_642"></a>[642]</span>
to be not merely the chief seat of learning in Flanders, but
one of the soundest nurseries of the faith. She held stoutly to
scholasticism, and was distinguished by her resolute opposition to
the Lutheran heretics; yet it was in vain that her enemies attempted
to charge her with retrogression, for even Erasmus owns in his letters,
that the schools of Louvain were considered second only to those
of Paris.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to explain the hostility which the Louvain
scholars had to encounter on the part of the partisans of the new
learning. Louvain, from the first, consecrated herself to the defence
of the scholastic theology. Immediately on the erection of the
theological faculty in 1431, the Dominicans arrived at Louvain, and
opened a school whence they sent forth fourteen doctors in the
space of twenty years. In 1447 they were formally admitted to all
the rights of the university, and obtained chairs of theology, and
the other privileges formerly granted to them at Paris and Bologna.
Their brethren were frequently aggregated to the college of the
strict faculty, and one of their order was always a member of the
council <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strictæ facultatis</i>. From this period the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">studium generale</i> of
the order at Louvain ranked as one of the highest character in the
order, and the influence of the Dominican doctors made itself
powerfully felt throughout the whole university. St. Thomas of
Aquin was <em>the</em> doctor, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par excellence</i>, of the Louvain schools, and in
1637 was chosen by the faculty of theology their perpetual patron
and protector. It is needless to say that this determined <em>Thomism</em>
was not more agreeable to the humanists and their partisans than
the <em>Scotism</em> of the Paris theologians; and they sought, with very
poor success, to squib down the university by representing it as
nothing but a nest of friars.</p>

<p>The University of Louvain enjoyed some advantages in which the
more ancient academies had been wanting. Not having grown up
out of accidental circumstances, like so many of her elder sisters,
but having been begun at a time when the principles necessary for
governing such institutions had been made manifest by long experience,
her founders were careful to provide her, from the first,
with a body of statutes sagaciously drawn up, so as to ensure the
preservation of regular discipline; and a well-organised collegiate
system protected the students from those disorders which had disgraced
the beginnings of Paris and Oxford.</p>

<p>In course of time separate schools and colleges were established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_643"></a>[643]</span>
for the different faculties, one for medicine, eight for arts, and eight
for mixed studies. Among the latter was Standonch’s college of
poor scholars, and the celebrated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collegium Trilingue</i> founded in
1516 by Jerome Busleiden, the friend of More and Erasmus, for
the study of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. The idea of this academy
had been suggested to the founder by a visit to Alcala, where
Cardinal Ximenes was then completing the establishment of his
university. Hallam tells us that its foundation was fiercely opposed
by the monks and friars, “those unbeaten enemies of learning,” and
it is true that the old professors did at first regard the new institution
with some jealousy. They had been used to write and speak
mediæval Latin, and grumbled sorely when required to turn
Ciceronians. The college happened to be first opened in the fish-market,
and hence arose the favourite bon-mot of the Louvain Conservatives,
“<em>We</em> do not talk <em>Fish-Market</em> Latin.” In time, however,
the fish-market Latin established its supremacy, and Louvain grew
proud of her classical professors, such as Louis Vives and Conrad
Goclen. The colleges gradually multiplied in number, and even at
the present day the city is filled with splendid buildings, all of which
owe their existence to the university of which they once formed part.</p>

<p>It was at Louvain that Pope Adrian VI. received his education,
and from a poor scholar rose to fill the posts of professor and
rector of the university. The son of a boat-builder of Utrecht, he
was admitted among a certain number of poor boys whom the
university bound itself to educate gratuitously, and endured rather
more than his share of the hardships and privations to which
scholars of that class are usually exposed. Seldom able to provide
himself with the luxury of a lamp or a candle, he was accustomed to
prosecute his studies after dark in the porch of some church,
where a lamp was then usually suspended, or at the street corner,
which supplied him with a feeble light. However, he seems sometimes
to have been able to procure himself a better sort of light, for
we read that, one cold winter’s night, Margaret, the widow of Duke
Charles of Burgundy, then governess of the Netherlands, remarked
a tiny ray that issued from one of the college windows at a very
late hour, and bidding her chamberlain find out which of the students
sat up so late in such intense cold, she was told that it was only
“little Florentius” over his books. With a woman’s instinct of compassion,
she sent him the next day three hundred florins for the
purchase of books and firewood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_644"></a>[644]</span></p>

<p>When he was afterwards raised to the head of the university, he
exhibited the same zeal for the promotion of ecclesiastical discipline
which afterwards won him so much unpopularity from his Roman
subjects. In spite of their contemptuous strictures on his supposed
barbarism, Adrian was revered in Louvain as a generous patron
of letters. He erected and endowed one of the most magnificent
colleges of which Louvain could boast, and in it was deposited the
autograph copy of his works, which is still preserved in the great
seminary of Mechlin.</p>

<p>A considerable number of other new universities sprang up in
Germany about the beginning of the sixteenth century, all more or
less stamped with the literary character of the age. Of these the
most famous was Wittemberg, marked out by an evil destiny as
the cradle of the Lutheran apostasy. It was founded in 1502 by
Frederic, elector of Saxony, who commissioned Staupitz, the provincial
of the Augustinians, to seek out men of learning and ability
to fill its vacant professorships. Luther was invited hither in 1508
to teach the Aristotelian logic, and, four years later, after his return
from Rome, received his doctor’s cap, and took the customary oaths
to defend the faith against heresy to the last drop of his blood. In
1516 the professor was to be found waging open war against the
philosophy he was engaged to teach, and drawing up ninety-nine
theses against the scholastic theology, in which is clearly laid down
the fundamental dogma of Lutheranism&mdash;the denial of free-will.
They were published many years later with a preface by Melancthon,
declaring them to contain the veritable sum of the reformed religion,
which had thus been reduced to system a year before that quarrel
with Tetzel, usually represented as the origin of Luther’s revolt.</p>

<p>Melancthon was given the chair of Greek in 1518, on the recommendation
of his master Reuchlin, and was introduced to Wittemberg
at the moment when Luther’s quarrel had been taken up by
the students and professors. In him Luther gained a disciple whose
learning and natural moderation of character were worthy of better
things than to become the author of the Confession of Augsburg,
and the colleague of Bucer. That horrible apostate, a renegade
Dominican, who condescended to every one of the rival schools of
heresy, provided only he was suffered to enjoy the license which
first tempted him to abjure the faith, filled for twenty years the theological
chair at Strasburg. Everywhere the reins of power had fallen
into the hands of the pedagogues, and the Lutheran army was to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_645"></a>[645]</span>
seen officered by humanists and university professors. The facilities
offered by the numerous academies that had sprung up since the
beginning of the century encouraged a rage for learning among all
classes, and many a poor artisan’s son, like Wolfgang Musculus, or
the notorious Henry Bullinger, scraped together a scanty pittance
by street singing, which they afterwards spent in procuring the
means of study at one or other of the universities. Musculus,
indeed, found charitable patrons in the person of some Benedictine
monks, who educated him, and gave him the habit; but he soon
abandoned the cloister, and after a wild adventurous life, during
which we find him working as a mason, and, during the scanty
moments he could snatch from his toil, studying the Hebrew
grammar, he became “Minister” of Strasburg, and theological
professor in the Protestant University of Berne. About the same
time the Greek professorship of Calvin’s college at Geneva was
filled with another of these strange itinerant scholars, Sebastian
Castillon, a native of Dauphiny, who studied the Oriental tongues
in the early morning hours, before he went to his day labour in the
fields. He afterwards quarrelled with Calvin, who accused him of
theft, and went to teach Greek and Hebrew at Basle. Here he produced
a Latin and French version of the Scriptures, and endeavoured
to render the sacred books into the classical diction of profane
authors. We can scarcely form any correct idea of the period of
the Reformation without a glimpse at men of this stamp, who then
swarmed in every part of Germany; restless, self-sufficient, often
more than half self-taught, their minds untrained with the healthy
discipline of the schools, disposed to run after every novelty, and to
overvalue themselves and their attainments, they inevitably fell into
the extravagances to which vanity commonly betrays her victims.</p>

<p>From this class of men the German professorships were chiefly
recruited, and little foresight was needed to anticipate the consequences
which must ensue when the work of education had passed
into such hands. The state of the German universities during the
century subsequent to the Lutheran revolution, has been described
by the Protestant historian Menzel, from whom Rohrbacher has
quoted some remarkable passages. “The colleges where the future
ministers of the Lutheran religion spent six or seven years, were the
abode of a ferocity and licentiousness from which our moral sensibility
shrinks aghast. In the German schools and universities, the
elder students obliged new-comers to go about in ragged garments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646"></a>[646]</span>
filled their mouths with ‘soup’ made of mud and broken bits of
earthenware, compelled them to clean their boots and shoes, and by
way of salary, to imitate the barking of dogs and the mewing of cats,
and to lick up the filth from under the table. In vain did the
princes endeavour to banish these savage customs; they held their
ground in spite of ordinances and edicts.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> At the University of
Jena, the younger students were robbed of their money, their clothes,
and their books by their elder companions, and compelled to discharge
the most disgraceful services. Those who had received what
was called “absolution,” treated new-comers in the same way; and
these outrages were often committed in the streets, and even in the
churches during the preaching, when the poor victims were pulled
and knocked about, and otherwise maltreated by their persecutors.
And that no one might escape, a particular part of the church was
devoted to the reception of “freshmen,” who were installed there
with these edifying ceremonies. Hence, during the whole time of
divine service, one incessant clamour went on, made up of the
trampling, the cries, the murmurs, and coarse laughter of the combatants.</p>

<p>If such were the manners of the future pastors, those of their flocks
may be imagined. Any one who tried to lead a good life, observes
Menzel, was stigmatised as an enthusiast, a Schwenkfeldian, an
Anabaptist, and a hypocrite; Luther’s dogma of justification by faith
only having brought good works into actual discredit. It was
dangerous at that time for a preacher to exhort his people to keep
the commandments&mdash;as if they were able to do so&mdash;it was quite
sufficient to render him a suspected person.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> But we have no heart
to dwell on this subject, or to realise the degradation of those old
German dioceses and schools, the names of which are so linked in
our hearts with the memory of St. Boniface and St. Wilibald, St.
Bernward and St. Anscharius. So we will turn our back on Germany
and seek on Catholic soil for some more consoling spectacle. We
shall hardly find it in France: there, indeed, a revival of letters is
going on, under the splendid patronage of Francis I.; and Budæus,
the prodigy of his country, as Erasmus called him, is writing his
learned treatise on Ancient Money, and persuading the king to found
the College Royal. There perhaps the greatest scholar of his time,
though known to posterity chiefly by his artistic fame, Leonardo da<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_647"></a>[647]</span>
Vinci, is expiring at Fontainebleau in the arms of the king. But the
French Renaissance school is mostly remarkable for its poets, by
whom, indeed, the revival of letters was first set on foot. Much
edification was not to be anticipated from a movement that reckoned
as its originator Villon, whose verses were as infamous as his life,
and who found a worthy successor in Clement Marot. The French
kings, who by their Pragmatic Sanctions<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> had condemned the Papal
provision of benefices as a crying abuse, used their royal patronage
of the same as a convenient mode of rewarding Court poets. Thus
Octavien de St. Gelais, the translator of Terence, obtained the
bishopric of Angoulême from Charles VIII.; and his son, Melin de
St. Gelais, surnamed the French Ovid, was rewarded by Francis I.
for his “Epigrams” with an abbey. Ronsard, formally proclaimed
“the Poet of France, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par excellence</i>,” who was born on the same day
as the defeat of Pavia&mdash;as though (to make use of the king’s words)
“Heaven would make up to France, by his birth, for the disgrace
sustained by her arms”&mdash;who was the literary idol of his time, had
statues erected to his honour, and silver images of the goddess
Minerva presented to him by learned academies, to whom Elizabeth
sent a rich diamond, and Mary Stuart presented a gilded model of
Parnassus&mdash;the most appropriate present that could be offered to
the new Apollo&mdash;Ronsard, the vainest of men, as he might well be,
for assuredly he was the most flattered, died, literally overwhelmed
under the weight of his laurels and his priories. I will not attempt
the enumeration of his benefices, and perhaps he would hardly have
undertaken the task himself, for the prince of poets enjoyed the
revenues of half the royal monasteries of France. It would be unbecoming
to notice any writer of less renown, after so very illustrious a
personage, and the bare name of Rabelais will probably content
most readers. These were the stars of the French Renaissance, well
worthy of the monarch who patronised them, and the Court over
which he presided. Warton has thought good to praise the enlightened
wisdom which induced this prince to purge his Court from the
monkish precision of old-fashioned times, and enliven it with a larger
admixture of ladies’ society. There was certainly not much to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_648"></a>[648]</span>
complained of on the score of precision in the coteries of Fontainebleau;
yet it is curious that the fair dames who graced the royal
circle were chosen by the grim disciples of Calvin as the likeliest
agents for disseminating their views. The ladies of the Court of
Francis I. were the first Huguenot apostles, and it was in this school
that Anne Boleyn, in her quality of maid of honour to Queen Claude,
acquired, together with her inimitable skill in dancing, that “gospel
light” which, the poet informs us, first shone on England and her
king “from Boleyn’s eyes.”</p>

<p>Let us rather direct our steps across the Pyrenees, and watch the
erection of a Catholic university on the orthodox soil of Spain. Up
to this time the education which prevailed in the peninsula appears
to have been thoroughly of the old school. The Spanish universities
had indeed some peculiarities arising from their proximity to the
Moorish schools, and appear to have cultivated the geometrical
sciences and the Eastern tongues more generally than was elsewhere
the practice. But the prevailing tone was scholastic and ecclesiastical.
The monasteries still maintained those public schools, which served
as feeders to the universities, and in these a discipline was kept up
differing very little from that of Fulda and St Gall. At Montserrat,
peasants and nobles were received together, and each wore a little
black habit, and, in church, a surplice. They sang every day at the
Mass, and recited the Office of Our Lady, eating always in the
refectory of the brethren, and sleeping in a common dormitory.
Every month they went to confession, as well as on all festivals, and
their studies were of the monastic stamp, with plenty of Latin and
plain chant, and also instrumental music. A number of the bravest
Spanish knights had their education in these monastery schools, and
one of them, John of Cardonna, who commanded the galleys of
Sicily, and relieved Malta when besieged by the Turks, chose as his
patroness, in memory of his school days, Our Lady of Montserrat,
and bore her banner into battle. He used to call himself Our Lady’s
page, and said he valued the privilege of having been brought up in
her house more than his rank as admiral.</p>

<p>But these are old-fashioned memories, and must give place to
something more in accordance with the requirements of the age.
The Renaissance was making its way even into the Spanish schools,
and the literary movement had been fortunate enough to find a
nursing mother in the person of Isabella the Catholic. German
printers and Italian professors were invited into her kingdom, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_649"></a>[649]</span>
Spanish students sent to gather up the treasures of learning in foreign
academies. Among these was Antonio de Lebrija, whom Hallam
calls the restorer of classical literature in Spain. Italian masters
directed the education of the royal children, and from them the
Princess Catherine, doomed to be the hapless Queen of Henry VIII.,
received those learned tastes which won the admiration of Erasmus.
A Palatine school was attached to the Court, in imitation of that of
Charlemagne, and was placed under the direction of Peter Martyr,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
whose letters are filled with accounts of the noble pupils who thronged
his school, won from frivolous pastimes by the charm of letters. In
1488 he appeared at Salamanca to deliver lectures on Juvenal, and
writes word that the audience who came to hear him so blocked up
the entrance to the hall, that he had to be carried to his place over
the heads of the students, “like a victor in the Olympic games.”
The rage for learning went on at such a pace that the proudest
grandees of Castile thought it not beneath them to ascend the professor’s
chair, and even noble ladies delivered lectures on classical
learning in the halls of universities.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The queen’s noble encouragement
of learning had been fostered by her confessor, F. Francis
Ximenes; and when, in 1495, the Franciscan friar became Archbishop
of Toledo and Primate of Spain, one of his first thoughts was
the erection of a model university, to which he resolved to devote the
immense revenues of his see.</p>

<p>It has been said that seats of learning require the accessories of a
fine air, and even the charms of natural scenery; and we might quote
one of the most exquisite pieces of word-painting to be found in any
language,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> which is written to show the special gift enjoyed by
Athens, rendering her worthy to be the capital of mind. It was the
clear elastic air of Attica which communicated something of its own
sunniness and elasticity to the intellect of her citizens, just as it
imparted a golden colouring even to the marble dug out of that
favoured soil. So it had been with Paris, the Athens of the Middle
Ages, where students from the foggy shores of Britain conceived
themselves endowed with some new faculty when relieved from
the oppression of their native atmosphere. And even Louvain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_650"></a>[650]</span>
though less favoured than these by nature, had been chosen in
preference to other Flemish cities, chiefly on account of her
purer air and her pleasant <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">entourage</i> of copses and meadows, with
their abundant store of “corn, apples, sheep, oxen, and chirping
birds.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that Ximenes, when seeking the
fittest spot in which to plant his academy, took very gravely into
consideration the question of scenery and climate. The clear atmosphere
of Alcala, and the tranquil landscapes on the banks of the
Henares, so soothing to the meditative eye, had their share in determining
him to fix his foundation at the ancient Complutum. In its
grammar schools he had made his early studies, and old boyish
recollections attached him to the spot, the ancient traditions of which
rendered it dear to Christian scholars.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> There, then, in the year
1500 he laid the foundation of his first college, which he dedicated
to his saintly predecessor, St. Ildefonsus. This was intended to be
the head college of the university, to which all the others were in a
manner to be subordinate. It consisted of thirty-three professors,
in honour of the years of our Lord’s earthly life, and twelve priests
or chaplains, in honour of the twelve Apostles. These latter had
nothing to do with the education of the students, but were to recite
the divine office in common, and carry out the rites of the Church
with becoming solemnity. The professors, who were all to be theologians,
were distinguished by their dress, a long red robe, which,
being flung over their left shoulder, hung to the ground in large and
graceful folds. The colleges of St. Balbina and St. Catherine were
intended for students in philosophy, each containing forty-eight
students. There was a small college, dedicated to Our Lady, for
poor students in theology and medicine; and a larger one, used for
the reception of the sick. The college of SS. Peter and Paul was
exclusively for Franciscan scholars, corresponding in character to
the monastic colleges or houses of study at Oxford. There were
also two classical schools for young students, forty-two of whom
received a free education for three years; these were severally dedicated
to St. Eugenius and St. Isidore. And lastly, there was the
college of St. Jerome for the three languages, in which ten scholars
studied Latin, ten Greek, and ten Hebrew; a foundation which, as
we have seen, formed the model on which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collegium Trilingue</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_651"></a>[651]</span>
at Louvain was afterwards established.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> I will say nothing of the
libraries, refectories, and chapels, all of which were finished with
great splendour; and the whole city was restored and beautified, so
as to make it more worthy of being the site of so magnificent a seat
of learning. Other houses of study soon sprang up in connection
with the different religious orders, all of which were anxious to
secure for their members advantages which were nowhere else to
be found in such abundance. For though Ximenes was a mighty
builder, and thereby exposed himself to many bad puns from Court
wits, who made much of the “<em>edification</em>” he gave when he superintended
his workmen rule in hand, he certainly did not neglect
the spiritual for the material building. Eight years after he had
solemnly laid the foundation stone of his first college, the university
was opened, and a brilliant staff of professors&mdash;in all forty-two in
number&mdash;were gathered round the Cardinal primate to receive their
respective offices from his hands. The government of the university
was vested in the hands of a chancellor, rector, and senate. The
system of graduation was copied from that of Paris, except that the
theological degrees were given a pre-eminence over the others, and
made both more honourable and more difficult to attain. The professorships
were distributed as follows:&mdash;Six for theology; six for
canon law; four for medicine; one, anatomy; one, surgery; nine,
philosophy; one, mathematics; four, Greek and Hebrew; four,
rhetoric; and six, grammar. There was no chair of civil law, as
this faculty was excellently taught at the other Spanish universities,
and Ximenes had no liking for it, and did not wish to introduce it
at Alcala, probably fearing lest it might prevent that predominance
of the theological faculty which he desired should be the characteristic
of his university. Provision was made for the support of
the aged and infirm professors; and on this point the Cardinal
consulted his former colleague in the regency of Castile, Adrian of
Utrecht, and established similar regulations to those which existed
at Louvain. The system of studies and rule of college discipline
were drawn up by himself, the former being in a great degree borrowed
from that established at Paris. Frequent disputations and
examinations quickened the application of the students, and at these
Ximenes loved to preside, and encourage the emulation of his
scholars with his presence. In the choice of his professors he considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_652"></a>[652]</span>
nothing but the merit of the candidates, and set at nought
all the narrowness of mere nationality. Spain was by this time,
however, able to furnish humanists and philologists equal to those
of Italy or Germany. And most of the first professors were of native
birth. Among them was Antonio de Lebrija, and though he afterwards
accepted a chair at Salamanca, yet he finally returned to
Alcala, and rendered invaluable aid to Ximenes in the philological
labours in which he was about to engage, and which shed an additional
lustre over the new academy.</p>

<p>Ximenes had always manifested a peculiar predilection for the
cultivation of Biblical literature. In his earlier years his love of the
Holy Scriptures had induced him to devote himself to the study of
Hebrew and Chaldaic, and he had often been heard to say that he
would willingly give up all his knowledge of jurisprudence to be able
to explain a single verse of the Bible. He considered a thorough
revival of biblical studies the surest means of defeating the new
heretics, and in the midst of Court engagements and political toils,
he at length conceived the plan of his great Polyglot Bible, in which
the sacred text was to appear in the four learned languages, after the
most correct versions that could be obtained. This great work,
which was to serve as the model for all subsequent attempts of a
similar kind, was no sooner designed than he set about its execution,
and secured the co-operation of a number of skilful scholars,
fixing on Alcala as the scene of their labours. Immense sums were
expended in obtaining Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldaic manuscripts;
and in his dedication, Ximenes acknowledges the invaluable
assistance which he received from Pope Leo X. The plan was
exactly one sure to engage the sympathies of that generous Pontiff,
who accordingly placed at his command all the treasures of the
Vatican Library. The costly work when complete presented the
Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the Greek version of the Septuagint,
the Latin version of St. Jerome, and the Chaldaic paraphrase
of the Pentateuch, together with certain letters, prefaces, and dissertations
to assist the study of the Sacred Books. The work was
commenced in 1502, and the last volume was published in 1517.
The same energy which had succeeded, in the brief space of eight
years, in raising a university which received the title of “the eighth
wonder of the world,” was able, in fifteen years, to bring to a happy
conclusion a literary undertaking which might well have occupied
thrice that space of time. Ximenes, who felt his end approaching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_653"></a>[653]</span>
desired to leave all his great works complete, and urged on his
scholars with frequent admonitions on the shortness of human life.
If <em>they</em> lost <em>him</em> as their patron, or if <em>he</em> were to lose <em>their</em> labours, the
whole design might fall to the ground. On the 10th of July 1517
the last sheet of the great Complutensian Polyglot was printed, and
the young son of the printer, Bocario, putting on his holiday garments,
ran at once to present it to the Cardinal. Ximenes received it with
a solemn emotion of gratitude and joy. “I thank Thee, O Lord
Christ,” he said, “that Thou hast brought this work to a desired
end.” It was as though he had been permitted this as his last
earthly consolation, for four months later he closed his great and
useful career, being in the eighty-second year of his age.</p>

<p>Louvain and Alcala, the two great Catholic creations of the age of
the Renaissance, both fell under the hammer of Revolution. The
memory of Ximenes has not prevailed to preserve his university from
destruction at the hands of the Spanish Progressistas, and we can but
hope that its restoration may be reserved for another generation.
That of Louvain has been witnessed even in our own time. Swept
away in 1797 by the decree of the French Republic, which at the
same time suppressed all the great ecclesiastical seminaries, it was
not restored by the Nassau sovereigns who, in 1814, became masters
of the Catholic Netherlands. William of Holland, so far from
showing his Catholic subjects any larger degree of favour than they
had enjoyed under French rule, did his best to render their position
worse than it had been under the Revolution. He put down all the
little seminaries, and proposed to supply the place of the ancient
university of Louvain by a grand royal philosophical college, through
which all ecclesiastical students were to be compelled to pass before
being received into the great seminaries. This was in the June of
1825; in the January of 1830 the determined resistance of the
Belgian Catholics obliged him to suppress his college, which had
proved a total failure. The August following witnessed the expulsion
of his dynasty and the establishment of Belgian independence; events
which were followed in 1834 by the erection at Louvain of a new
university, in virtue of an Apostolic brief of Pope Gregory XVI.</p>

<p>Planted on the Belgian soil, which has so long and so successfully
resisted the inroads of heresy, and which appears destined in our own
day to become the battle-ground of a yet deadlier struggle with open
unbelief, the Catholic university of Louvain has already merited to
be declared by illustrious lips “the glory of Belgium and of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_654"></a>[654]</span>
Church.” She has been presented by the Sovereign Pontiff
to the Catholics of these islands, as the model on which our own
academic restorations may fitly be formed; and at this very moment
her example is understood to have encouraged the prelates of
Germany to attempt a similar foundation in that land. May their
generous efforts be crowned with ample success, and may such
institutions, wherein Faith and Science will never be divorced,
multiply in the Church, supported by the prayers and good wishes
of every Catholic heart.</p>

<p class="pfs90">THE RENAISSANCE IN ROME.</p>
<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1513 TO 1528.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the 11th of April 1513 the streets of Rome were
thronged with a joyous and expectant crowd, assembled to witness
the public procession of the newly-elected Pontiff, Leo X., on occasion
of his taking possession of the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Many
circumstances combined to render the accession of Leo welcome to
his new subjects: they had already felt the charm of his courteous
manners, springing partly from careful culture, and partly from an
innate kindness of heart; and whilst the Roman citizens, who were
heartily tired of the wars and war-taxes of Julius II., rejoiced at the
prospect of peace and plenty, the artists and professors, who made up
a population by themselves, regarded the election of a Medici as a
sufficient guarantee for the protection of their personal interests.
The son of Lorenzo, and the pupil of Politian, of Chalcondylus, and
of Bernard Dovizi, he had imbibed a love of art and poetry in the
gardens of Florence and the villas of Fiesole. Created a Cardinal
at the age of fourteen, he was but thirty-seven at the period of his
election to the Papal chair, and during his residence at Rome under
the two preceding Pontificates had acquired a character which his
friends condensed into a motto, and exhibited in golden letters on
the canopy under which he was enthroned, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Litteratorum præsidium
ac bonitatis fautor</i>. If an ancient statue had been disinterred in the
baths of Titus, the Cardinal de’ Medici had been the first to celebrate
the auspicious event in graceful iambics improvised to the music of
his lyre; his house had been the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</i> of artists, poets, and,
above all, of musicians; and whilst men of this stamp loudly proclaimed
the taste and munificence of the new Pontiff, the unblemished
name which he had preserved in the midst of a society the corruptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_656"></a>[656]</span>
of which were matter of public notoriety, put to silence the busy
tongue of scandal.</p>

<p>It was truly, therefore, a festa-day which his subjects were now
celebrating; and as he rode on his white charger through the
brilliant streets, men contrasted his mild and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débonnaire</i> countenance,
his gay smile, and affable address; with the imperious bearing of his
predecessor, the warlike Julius; and the contrast was all to his
advantage. What a scene it was through which he was now passing!
Rome had been all but rebuilt under the four last Pontiffs, and from
the Vatican to the Coliseum the way was marked with monuments
of their munificence and of the genius of their artists. Domes,
amphitheatres, arcades, and fountains had risen during the last
seventy years with magnificent profusion; the old Basilica of the
Apostles had disappeared, and was in process of being replaced by a
pile worthy of the vast conceptions of its founders and its architects.
And now the splendid city had decked herself in gala costume, and
amid velvet tapestries and flowery wreaths, triumphal arches, and
private houses, with their facades improvised into heathen temples,
appeared a strange medley of saints and mythological characters, in
which the statues of Mars, Apollo, Minerva, and Venus, were exhibited
in close proximity to those of SS. Peter and Paul. On the whole,
however, the classic element predominated, and the characters chosen
at each resting-place to harangue the new Pontiff were the Muses, the
Seasons, and their attendant nymphs.</p>

<p>The hopes and expectations of the Roman populace on that day
were abundantly fulfilled. Leo did his best to restore peace to Italy,
and raised Rome to the dignity of a great capital. Few princes have
ever been more richly endowed than he with the qualities which make
princedom popular; a liberality which bordered on profuseness, a
generous readiness to reward merit, and a charming urbanity of
manners, which made every one who approached his person believe
himself the object of the Pope’s particular regard. Erasmus felt the
magical influence of his presence, and wrote to his friends, saying,
that Leo was as far superior to the rest of men, as men are superior,
to beasts. “He has the genius and the virtues of all the Leos who
have preceded him, and to perfect goodness of heart,” he continues,
“he unites an incredible strength of soul.” In the church all
beholders admired the majesty with which he officiated at the sacred
ceremonies; and his temperate habits in private have been praised by
all his biographers. He was not only a passionate lover of literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_657"></a>[657]</span>
and science, but was firmly persuaded that the cultivation of letters,
rightly regarded, is ever friendly to the faith. “I have always loved
learned men and good letters,” he wrote to Henry VIII. “This
attraction was born with me, and it has only increased with years;
for I always see that those who cultivate literature are most firmly
attached to the dogmas of the faith, and form the glory of the
Christian Church.” His patronage of arts and letters, therefore, was
hearty and munificent enough to satisfy even the requirements of
the learned world around him. He restored the Roman University,
and appointed a brilliant staff of professors, men not only of the first
ability, but of exemplary life. In his Bull addressed to the students,
he failed not to warn them against substituting Plato and the poets
for more serious studies, and reminded the preceptors that they were
called on to defend the faith as well as to teach good letters. His
own tastes, however, had the character which might have been anticipated
from his education: they inclined almost exclusively to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>. In many cases the classic acquirements of those who
were now promoted to canonries and Cardinals’ hats were more
regarded than their personal merits. Bernard Dovizi, who, as tutor
to the young Medici, had studiously and successfully laboured to confer
on his manners that exquisite polish which was his greatest charm,
was now raised to the purple, and, as Cardinal Bibiena, endeavoured
to surround the Pontifical palace with every attraction of a secular
Court. The literary public of those days was not easily scandalised,
but it was at least taken by surprise by the first production which came
from the new Cardinal’s pen, his comedy of “Calandra,” written as
a carnival piece for the amusement of a noble lady, and acted in the
private apartments of the Vatican.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Ariosto was also welcomed at
Court, and even the infamous Aretino received marks of favour,
whilst Bembo and Sadolet, the two first Latinists of their day, were
appointed the Pope’s secretaries.</p>

<p>The patronage of Leo was not limited to any one kind of literary
excellence. He was as ready to reward a scientific treatise as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_658"></a>[658]</span>
imitation of Horace, and whilst encouraging the study of the Eastern
tongues, and publishing at his own expense a magnificent edition of
Tacitus from the unique manuscript obtained from the abbey of Old
Corby, he was accepting the dedication of Italian tragedies and
causing the “Rosamunda” of Ruccellai to be acted in his presence.
Almost his first act after his accession to the Papal dignity was to
summon Lascaris to Rome, and establish him in a palace on the
Esquiline, where, in concert with Musurus, he superintended a Greek
academy and printing press. Zenobius Acciajoli, the most learned
Orientalist of his day, who had shone among the stars of Lorenzo’s
Court, and had afterwards assumed the Dominican habit and dedicated
his genius to sacred studies, now became Prefect of the Vatican
Library; whilst another Oriental scholar of the same order, the celebrated
Sanctes Pagninus, found generous encouragement to undertake
his Latin translation of the Scriptures from the original tongues.</p>

<p>But whilst extending his splendid patronage to every department
of literature, the personal predilections of Leo were undoubtedly for
poetry and the arts. Like a true Medici he loved the sunny side of
life, and delighted in surrounding himself with poets, wits, and
musicians, he himself being the gayest wit and best musician of the
party. The Court was crowded with professional improvisatori who
enlivened the suppers at the Vatican with their jests and pastimes.
In the mornings there were literary assemblies in which the great
men of the day recited their poems or epigrams, or more learned
works. Now it was Vida, whom Leo had engaged to undertake the
composition of his “Christiad,” and who beguiled his lighter hours
by setting forth the mysteries of the game of chess in Latin hexameters;
or Paulus Jovius,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> the Italian Livy, who came to read a chapter
of his history; or “the divine Accolti,” as he was called, who recited
his poems surrounded by a guard of honour, and who in return for
his lyric productions was raised to the dukedom of Nepi and a
bishopric.</p>

<p>Under such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> the arts flourished, and men of letters were
promoted to wealth and dignities; Rome grew daily more luxurious
and more splendid, but, alas! it must be said, her moral atmosphere
was a pestilence. The historian Mariana declares that at the opening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_659"></a>[659]</span>
of the sixteenth century greater disorders existed there than were
to be witnessed in any other European capital. Even Bembo,
whose own life at this time was a disgrace to the ecclesiastical habit,
admits the charge, and owns that he who desired to lead a holy life
would do well to fly from Rome.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> What else could be anticipated
of a society made up of artists and professors, paganised to the very
core in its literature, its language, and its every maxim? And when
we say <em>paganised</em>, let it not be supposed that the simple restoration
of classical studies is here intended, or that the abuses complained
of consisted only of the extravagances of a few learned pedants. In
Italian literary circles, if we may credit historians of the time, the
Christian ideas were slowly becoming obliterated. It had grown
fashionable in certain coteries to scoff at all the Christian dogmas
as obsolete and barbarous; and Antonio Bandino complains that
you were no longer regarded as a man of education unless you
could jest at the Scriptures and indulge in some witty piece of
scepticism. Many of the Italian schools were deeply infected with
infidelity, particularly the University of Padua, which for more than
a century had been notorious as the focus of atheism. Pomponatus,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
one of the Paduan professors, published a treatise on the immortality
of the soul, during the reign of Leo X., in which he endeavoured
to show that the doctrine was not held by Aristotle, that it rested
<em>only</em> on the authority of Scripture and the Church, and was plainly
opposed to reason. A great number of professors taught similar
errors, and pretended that though contrary to revelation they might
yet be taught as <em>philosophically</em> true. These were condemned in
1513 by the Fifth Council of Lateran, which formally declared that
“truth could not contradict truth;” and to counteract the dangerous
spirit prevalent in the universities it was at the same time decreed that
students aspiring to sacred orders should not follow the course of
philosophy and poetry for more than five years, unless at the same
time they studied theology and canon law.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> But little or no fruit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_660"></a>[660]</span>
was produced by this decree, and as we shall see, at a somewhat
later period the “great and pernicious abuses” which were admitted
as loudly demanding reform, were formally declared by a commission
of Cardinals to have arisen mainly from the impious teaching
tolerated in the public schools.</p>

<p>In fact, Italy was at this time <em>professor-ridden</em>. Of all odious
dogmatisms surely that of pedagogues is the most intolerable form of
social tyranny, and under this the Transalpine world was then groaning.
Armed with their pens and their tinsel eloquence the men of
letters wrote down and talked down all opposition, and made so
much noise in the world that they seemed for a time to occupy a
much larger and more influential position than was really the case.
They dictated their laws to the literary world, and every one who
would not be pasquinaded as a barbarian was content to follow the
fashion. So in the pulpit preachers called on their audience to contemplate
the examples of Epaminondas or Socrates; parallels were
drawn between the sacred events of the Passion, and the self-devotion
of a Curtius or a Decius: our Divine Lord was commonly spoken of
as a hero who had deserved well of his country, and not unfrequently
allusions would be introduced to the thunders of Jupiter and the
stories of heathen mythology.</p>

<p>The grand object of Italian scholars at this time was to attain a
pure Ciceronian style, and in this none were more successful than
the two papal secretaries, Sadolet and Bembo. The pains taken by
the latter on his compositions at least deserved success. He is said
to have kept forty portfolios, into each of which his sheets were
successively entered, and only passed on to the one next in order
after undergoing careful revision. The rejection of every phrase not
absolutely Ciceronian led to very strange affectation when speaking
of events of ordinary life, as well as to the more offensive fault of
adopting heathen phraseology on matters relating to the Christian
faith. Thus the accession of Leo was announced to foreign Courts
as having taken place “through the favour of the Immortal Gods;”
Divine grace was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnificentia divinitatis</i>; Our Lady was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_661"></a>[661]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dea Lauretana</i>, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma Parens</i>; and the Christian mysteries
were described in terms taken from the sacrificial terminology of
the Greeks. Erasmus had good sense enough to despise these
extravagances, and he did his utmost to render them ridiculous.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
He describes the Ciceronian spending a whole winter’s night on the
composition of a single sentence, compiling lexicons of Ciceronian
words, tropes, locutions, and pleasantries, more bulky than the great
orator’s entire works, and struggling with the insuperable difficulties
of rendering the wants and habits of a modern age into the colloquial
phraseology of the ancients.</p>

<p>The poets and artists followed the example set them by the professors.
They still occasionally condescended to choose Christian
subjects, but in most cases it was to debase them by a pagan method
of treatment. When Sannazar thought fit to employ his muse on so
old-fashioned a theme as the birth of Our Lord, he converted it into
a pagan fable, placed the prophecies of the Sibyls in the hands of
the Blessed Virgin, and the words of Isaias in the mouth of Proteus,
omitted the name of Jesus Christ throughout his entire poem, and
surrounded the holy crib with nymphs, satyrs, and hamadryads.
The very liturgy of the Church had a narrow escape of undergoing
a classical reform, and a new <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymnarium</i> appeared, drawn up by
Zachario Ferreri, “according to the true rules of Latinity and metre,”
in which, says Dom Guéranger, “occur every image and allusion to
pagan belief and customs which are to be met with in Horace.”
This work was undertaken by command of Leo X., but its use, though
permitted by Clement VII., was happily never enjoined on the
clergy.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the paganism of literature advanced the
paganism of morals. We are not here engaged in studying the
history of the Church, and may therefore be spared the pain of contemplating
her scandals&mdash;those scandals the existence of which, far
from weakening our faith, may rather confirm it, when we remember
that they were distinctly prophesied by her Divine Head as evils
which “must needs be” accomplished. Our business is with schools
and scholars, and, sooth to say, after wandering amid the dim
religious light of the mediæval cloisters, the blaze of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_662"></a>[662]</span>
literary circles, after first dazzling our eyes, reveals such bewildering
spectacles, that we look about for some retreat into which the
Christian scholar may creep and hide himself.</p>

<p>Such, perhaps, was the feeling of many a student who, coming
fresh from the schools of Louvain, or the cloisters of Winchester or
Oxford, found himself suddenly dropped down upon a world which
seemed to have broken loose from all time-honoured traditions of
scholastic life. Perhaps he had been used to set before him the
musty maxim of Philip the Almoner,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> that “that is no true science
which is not the companion of justice;” or he had learned from
Hugh of St. Victor to regard humility as the foundation of wisdom;
or he was familiar with the saying of the Angel of the schools, that
the best way to make progress in philosophy was to keep the commandments
of God. But if he had the gift of prudence, he would
think twice before citing such authorities in the polite circles of the
Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i>. He would have been hooted at as a barbarian.
The monks and schoolmen were never spoken of by the professors
of the new learning save in terms of execration and contempt. They
were, to use the language of Erasmus, wretched creatures, whose
language was as uncouth as their apprehension was dull. In those
days there was no greater reproach than to call a man a <em>Scotist</em>&mdash;it
meant precisely a <em>dunce</em><a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>&mdash;and those who held communion with the
Muses and the Graces would have judged it an affront to be required
to treat with respect the memory of St. Thomas or St. Bonaventure.
And truly their venerable names, and the maxims they had laid down
for the guidance of Christian scholars, would have been sadly out of
place in the sumptuous orgies of the Chigi palace, or those luxurious
soirées where prelates, ambassadors, and men of letters did not refuse
to appear as the guests of the most questionable characters. The
Roman academy which had been suppressed by Paul II., and had
revived under Julius II., was now at the height of its renown. Its
members generally met in some delicious suburban garden, and
there, under the shade of the thick foliage, in an atmosphere heavy
with the perfume of the orange-flower, they recited poems, proposed
philosophic questions, and whiled away with song and merriment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_663"></a>[663]</span>
long hours of the day and night. Amid scenes of such Epicurean
enjoyment the stranger might have been forgiven had he imagined
himself taking part in the revelries of pagan rather than of Christian
Rome. On the walls of the luxurious banqueting-rooms, in which
he assisted at those suppers of world-wide celebrity, he might see
representations from the comedies of Plautus, reminding him how
close a parallel was to be drawn between the manners described by
the Latin poet and those of the sixteenth century. From the elegant
revellers around him he might hear the authority of Pliny quoted
to prove that the human soul differed in nothing from that of beasts;
or, exchanging the philosophic for a lighter mood, he might perhaps
be called on to assist at some macaronic exhibition, such as the
crowning of Querno, the drunken buffoon, arch-poet of Rome; or
be required to listen to the facetious improvisation of Folengo or
Mariano Fetti,&mdash;the former a monk, the latter a friar,&mdash;both of whom
had quitted their cloisters to ply the trade of professional jesters.
Thankful enough he would be to escape from these polished circles
and return to his own barbarous land and the society of those rude
English, who, as Politian contemptuously remarked, “knew nothing
of letters, and busied themselves with their sheep,” and who perhaps
might, in their turn, have thought with the Psalmist, that it was
well with those who knew no literature, and were only mindful of
justice.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>We are not left merely to conjecture the abuses which throve
in such a soil. We have the grave avowal of the commission of
Cardinals already referred to, that “in no city was there to be witnessed
such corruption of manners as in this city, which should be an
example to all.” Vice, in fact, had ceased to wear a veil; it stalked
abroad under the noonday sun, and too often found illustrious
support. Yet, strange to say, the existing abuses, monstrous as they
were, were more superficial than they seemed. The evil scum that
rises to the surface of society must not always be taken as a test of
what lies beneath; the gaudy charlock may toss its wanton head and
blazon itself to the eye, but the good seed is quietly germinating
below, and in the day of harvest its sheaves will not be wanting.
The Church is happily not governed by professors and scholastics,
and at the very time when the literary world of Rome was exhibiting
the spectacles described above, the Fifth Council of Lateran was
holding its sessions in that very city, and promulgating its decrees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_664"></a>[664]</span>
for the reform of the Universities, the College of Cardinals, and the
Roman Court.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The Church, by the mouth of her episcopate, was
solemnly exposing and condemning those very evils which thoughtless
observers were perhaps laying to her charge. In the decree of
the Council on the study of the Scriptures and the liberal arts, the
Fathers, after setting forth the vital importance of the education of
youth, go on to declare that schoolmasters and professors are bound
not merely to teach their scholars grammar and rhetoric, but yet
more to instruct them in their religion, and to make them study
sacred hymns and psalms, and the lives of the saints; and forbid
anything to be taught on Sundays and festival days save what refers
in some way to religion or holy living. Decrees of this sort, if they
plainly indicate the deplorable practical paganism which at that time
prevailed in most public academies, show us also that the rulers of
the Church were sensible of the evil, and earnestly desirous to apply
a suitable remedy. And, as we shall see hereafter, this very city of
Rome that seemed so corrupt, cherished in her bosom a principle of
life and power, which eventually cast out the infection which had
hung over her so long, and so accomplished her own purification.
Long before Luther had uttered the word “Reform,” it had rung
through the halls of the Lateran. The Fathers of the Council spared
nothing and dissimulated nothing; and at the opening of the ninth
session, a remarkable oration was delivered by Antonio Pucci, clerk
to the Apostolic Chamber, in which he called on the Pope to set
about the work in earnest. “Holy Father!” he exclaimed, “you
desire to restore peace to Christendom, and you do well in so
desiring. But see first that you extinguish the intestine wars of our
vices, and exterior peace will soon reappear. Behold the world!
Behold the cloister! Behold the sanctuary! Everywhere there
are abuses to reform, and it is with the house of God that we must
begin.”</p>

<p>Yet it can be no great matter of surprise that passing strangers did
not always penetrate the distinction between the <em>Church</em> and the <em>City</em>
of Rome, and that the undeniable corruption of the Roman literary
circles brought ecclesiastical rulers into disrepute, and sapped in
many minds the sentiment of loyalty to the Apostolic See. That
both Erasmus and Luther carried with them from Rome fatal
impressions, which, each in his own way, turned to the detriment of
religion, is not to be doubted. Erasmus, indeed, had no cause to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_665"></a>[665]</span>
scandalised by a state of society which was exactly to his taste. He
was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêted</i> and flattered by prelates and philosophers, and in his letters
from Rome he wants words to express his raptures at those delicious
hours which he spent among libraries and academies, in the reunions
at the palace of the <em>divine</em> Cardinal San Giorgio, or the yet more
charming assemblies in the Pope’s private chambers. Yet, while
enjoying the cup of pleasure to the full, his keen sarcastic eye was
taking the measure of all he saw, and it was on his journey back
to the north, that he beguiled his travelling fatigues with composing
his “Praise of Folly,” in which Cardinals, Popes, and Prelates are
made the subject of his most caustic gibes and pleasantries. And
this, after all, is the way of the world; it is a lynx-eyed critic, and
has ever a rigorous standard for those who ought to be saints, and a
ready condemnation for those who fall short of it. Erasmus, who
was himself worldly to the heart’s core, had yet sense enough to
feel that worldliness, however delightful, was out of place on the
threshold of the apostles, and he made other men feel it too, with
all that biting irony of which he was the master.</p>

<p>Luther, a man of different mould, visited Rome in a widely
different spirit. He was in the first fervour of what he considered
his religious conversion, when in 1510 he came thither full of
enthusiasm, and fell on his knees as he entered the city, to kiss the
soil watered by the blood of martyrs; though he afterwards mocked
at his own devotion and at the simplicity with which he ran about
from church to church prepared to believe and venerate everything
that he saw. He too carried away impressions that were never
effaced. His coarse, strong Saxon nature had little taste for the
arts and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>, and was only repelled by the magnificence
around him. The Olympic deities that met his eye at every street
corner, the heathenish adornments of the very churches, where
pictures and images of Christian mysteries were presented in the
garb of paganism, and the yet worse heathenism which met his ears
from the elegant literary crowds among whom he passed in his
coarse friar’s frock, all this sank into his soul to be reproduced on
the day when he launched his imprecations against the seven-hilled
city, and held her up to the scorn of his countrymen, as “the
dwelling-place of dragons, the nest of bats and vultures, the resort
of hobgoblins, weasels, gnomes, and demons.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Nor did it matter
anything to his audience that the enormities he exposed were far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_666"></a>[666]</span>
surpassed by those which he committed, and that the apostle of
reform had himself let loose on the world the reign of frenzied
license; the scandals he propagated did the work which he intended,
and indelibly fixed in the Saxon mind the tradition which identified
Rome with Babylon.</p>

<p>We need not here concern ourselves with the history of that great
revolution which history miscalls the Reformation. Before the death
of Leo X., that which had been deemed in its beginning to be but
“a squabble of friars,” was ending in the apostasy of nations. The
Roman academicians, however, were less moved at the tidings
which reached them in 1520, that the Pope’s Bull, the Decretals,
and the Summa of St. Thomas, had all been burnt together by
Luther in the public square of Wittemberg, and that the Pope
himself had been declared by the same authority to be Antichrist,
than at another piece of intelligence, which was communicated to
them on February 9, 1522, and which startled them like a clap of
thunder. Leo was dead, and the choice of the Cardinals had fallen
on the Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht. The burning of St. Thomas
in person would have been a light matter to them, in comparison
with the election to the Papal dignity of a plain austere Louvain
professor; already known to fame as the advocate of ecclesiastical
discipline, the friend and colleague of Ximenes, and it was more
than whispered, the supporter of scholasticism. He was a Fleming,
a “Scotist,” a Goth, and the enemy of letters. He had come into
the city without pomp of any kind, and had ordered one of the half-finished
triumphal arches, that was to have cost a thousand ducats,
to be destroyed. He had discharged ninety out of the one hundred
equerries kept by his predecessor. He had brought his old Louvain
housekeeper with him to the Vatican, and was dismissing the improvisatori
and whole troops of other Court idlers. They had taken
him over the Museum attached to his palace, and he had been heard
to mutter the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Idola antiquorum</i>, when standing before the
group of the Laocoon. Some of Sadolet’s most elegant Latin
epistles had been placed in his hands, and he had briefly commented
on them as “the letters of a poet.” “I verily believe,” writes
Jerome Negri, in terrible alarm, “that he will do as Pope Gregory
did before him, make a clean sweep of our libraries, and perhaps
grind up our statues to furnish mortar for building St. Peter’s.”
The artists cried out that now they should all be starved; the professors
bewailed the certain return of Gothic barbarism: Bembo set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_667"></a>[667]</span>
out at once for Venice, and Sadolet retired to his bishopric of
Carpentras, where he displayed those noble qualities which had as
yet found no room to expand in the artificial atmosphere of the
Court.</p>

<p>Never was there a more undeserved reproach than that which
stigmatised Pope Adrian as the enemy of learning. Erasmus, who
had been defended by him from the attacks of some over-zealous
scholastics, judged far otherwise, but the Romans could not forgive
his indifference to ancient art, and his condemnation of those paganising
scholars, whom he termed “Terentians.” Still less could they
forgive his plain speaking on the subject of reform. “Many abominations,”
he said, “have existed near this Holy Chair, abuses in
spiritual matters, and evil everywhere. We pledge ourselves, on our
part, to use our utmost endeavour to reform that Court which
has, perhaps, been the source of the evils we deplore.”</p>

<p>In his brief pontificate of twenty-two months he was unable to
accomplish the work which lay so close to his heart. His death was
regarded by the Roman literati as a kind of providence, a special
grace from heaven which had averted the return of mediæval
barbarism; and some of them went so far as to adorn with garlands
the house of his physician, to whose want of skill the fatal termination
of Adrian’s illness was ascribed, hanging over his door the
inscription&mdash;“To the Saviour of his country.”</p>

<p>Yet those two-and-twenty months, which seemed so fruitless,
witnessed the turning of the tide. The election of another Medici
as successor to Adrian was the signal for extraordinary rejoicings,
and for the return to Rome of many who had abandoned it after the
accession of Adrian. Clement VII. had all the personal grace and
refined intellect of his family; he had less taste for pleasure, and
more aptitude for business than Leo, and was a true lover of learned
men. He induced Sadolet to resume his functions as secretary, and
did his best to engage Erasmus to devote his genius to the earnest
defence of the Church.</p>

<p>The spirits of the Romans revived when they witnessed the
splendid patronage of letters exercised by the new Pope and his kinsman,
Cardinal Hyppolitus de’ Medici, who entertained in his household
no fewer than three hundred learned men. The artists and
academicians confidently reckoned on a return of their golden age;
and yet all were more or less conscious of a certain indefinable
change which had stolen over the public mind, betokening that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_668"></a>[668]</span>
reaction was setting in, and that a new era was at hand. The German
revolt from the Church had by this time assumed proportions
which it was impossible to ignore. The question of the English
divorce was causing grave inquietudes, and whilst the shadow of new
and unprecedented calamities hung heavy over the world, even the
most indifferent minds felt perhaps that something more earnest was
called for at that moment than the cultivation of the Muses. It
cannot, indeed, be said that the tide of social corruption was
checked; yet another and a better element was silently at work;
and, hidden in the glittering crowd,</p>

<p>Clement had summoned to his Court several illustrious ecclesiastics
who, whilst inferior to none of their contemporaries in literary merit,
were desirous above all things to provide a remedy for those grave
domestic abuses which, they rightly felt, afflicted the Church more
heavily than any attacks from her exterior foes. Among these were
the Venetian, Gaspar Contarini, a profound scholar, and a man of
fervent piety; Sadolet, who, now greatly weaned from the pursuits
which had formerly absorbed him, desired to devote his remaining
years to his pastoral duties; Matthew Ghiberti, the worthiest prelate
of his time, whom Clement had admitted to his closest confidence,
and raised to the dignity of Chancellor and the see of Verona; the
Prothonotary, Cajetan of Thienna, and the Cardinal Caraffa, Archbishop
of Theate, who afterwards became Pope under the title of
Paul IV. The jubilee year 1525 also brought to Rome a number of
devout and earnest pilgrims, among whom was our own great countryman
Reginald Pole, then a student at Padua, whom Bembo called
the most virtuous young man in Italy, and whose happiness it was
to enter on his list of friends the name of almost every one of his
contemporaries most illustrious for scholarship or piety. Men of
this stamp felt the need, in the midst of that luxurious and enervating
atmosphere, of some tie of Christian fellowship which might support
and invigorate their spiritual life; and the result was the formation
of a humble confraternity which met in the church of SS. Silvestro
and Dorotea, and took the name of “the Oratory of Divine Love.”</p>

<p>Similar associations were springing up in other cities of Italy, but
that at Rome is remarkable as being the germ whence afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_669"></a>[669]</span>
developed the order of the Theatines. A plan was concerted among
the members of the confraternity for instituting an order of regular
clerks, in which the ancient canonical mode of life should be revived;
this being suggested as offering the surest means for effecting that
reformation of manners among the clergy which all good men so
earnestly desired to forward. This design was carried out with the
approbation of the Pope; Caraffa and St. Cajetan being chosen the
two first superiors. Of the latter it was commonly said that he
desired to reform the world without letting the world know he was
in it, and in the northern cities of Italy, where he had hitherto
chiefly resided, he had the character of uniting in one person the
seraphic gifts of a contemplative to the heroic virtues of an apostle.
The rule adopted by the regular clerks was nearly the same as that
of the ancient Canons Regular. It appears certain that their original
design included the formation of ecclesiastical seminaries, and in all
essential particulars the new foundation bore a striking resemblance
to that set on foot in the eighth century, with a very similar purpose,
by St. Chrodegang of Metz. And thus we see how saintly men,
when they took in hand the work of ecclesiastical reform, found no
better means for carrying out their views, than turning back into the
old paths, and following the traditions bequeathed them by a golden
antiquity.</p>

<p>The order of Theatines, however, whilst yet in its infancy, was
threatened with extinction when that terrible calamity fell upon
Rome, to describe which one needs to use the language of the
inspired writers, when they detail the woes that were to chastise the
guilty city, which was yet the chosen city of God. The political
combinations which had closely allied the Roman Pontiff with the
Court of France, exposed him to the hostility of the Emperor Charles
V., whose armies entered Italy in the early part of the year 1527,
and threatened to lay siege to Rome. On the 5th of May, the city
was stormed by the ferocious bands of the Constable de Bourbon,
consisting chiefly of German Lutherans, animated to frenzy by the
thirst for plunder and a wild religious fanaticism. The Pope took
refuge in the castle of St. Angelo, and from thence had the anguish
of witnessing his capital given up to scenes of sacrilege and violence
which find no equal in history. The sack of Rome by the barbarian
Goths lasted but six days, but the Germans held possession of their
prey for <em>nine months</em>, every hour of which witnessed some fresh
abomination. The citizens were subjected to horrible tortures, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_670"></a>[670]</span>
compel them to give up their hidden treasures; the churches were
desecrated, and sacred relics tossed about the streets; troop-horses
were stabled in the Pontifical chapel, and littered with Bulls and
decretals; mock celebrations of holy rites were performed by
drunken troopers, who, decked out with cardinals’ dresses, pretended
to hold a conclave, and proclaimed the election of Luther as Pope.
Out of a population of 85,000, 50,000 citizens are calculated to have
perished by torture and the sword, and the excesses of the soldiers
at last brought a pestilence in their train, which all but annihilated,
the conquerors themselves; so that the city, awhile before so brilliant
and luxurious, became little better than a desolate and fetid tomb.</p>

<p>Amid the nameless horrors of that time it is needless to say that
neither piety nor learning procured any mercy for their owners. St.
Cajetan was scourged and tortured, and then compelled with his
brethren to abandon the Roman territory and take refuge in Venice;
where their modest house a few years later afforded hospitality to St.
Ignatius and his first companions. As to the academicians, we are
assured by Jerome Negri that the very few who escaped from the
sword were dispersed into foreign lands, and that all subsequent
efforts to restore their Society on its former footing proved an utter
failure. In fact, when the city was at last delivered from the
apostate hordes that possessed her, it was only to be exposed to the
new scourges of famine, pestilence, and inundation, and during these
calamities there reappeared in her streets, not the gay bands of artists
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i>, but reformed Camaldolese and Capuchin friars, whose
existence in the city, says one writer, was first made known to the
Romans during the plague of 1528. Rome, indeed, recovered from
her overwhelming disasters with astonishing rapidity, and it was not
long before the Court of Clement VII. reassumed much of the
brilliant character which it had borne under Leo X. But Roman
society no longer groaned under the dictatorship of professors. The
grave troubles of the Church drew to her capital men of earnest and
exalted piety, who responded to the cry that came from every
Catholic land for a General Council that should not only vindicate
the doctrine of the Church against heretical innovators, but courageously
enter on the reform of practical abuses. Delivered by her
terrible chastisement from the meretricious splendour of a false prosperity,
Rome prepared to put on her beautiful garments as of old,
and to purify herself from the contagion which worldly men had
brought into the very presence of the sanctuary. Even whilst her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_671"></a>[671]</span>
enemies were counting her among the dead, and rejoicing over her
humiliation, she arose to a more beautiful and vigorous life than
ever, so that many of those whose hearts had become estranged
turned to her once more, and beholding her invested with the
majesty of ancient discipline, recognised the seven-hilled city to be
indeed “the city of truth, the mountain of the Lord of Hosts, the
sanctified mountain.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p class="pfs90"><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1473 TO 1550.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> revival of polite letters in this country may be considered as
dating from the foundation of Magdalen College, in 1473. Not only
was it the most perfectly constituted college in the realm, but its
great founder had amply provided for the cultivation of humane
literature; and at the period of his death, Grocyn, the future restorer
of Greek studies at Oxford, was Divinity Professor, and Wolsey and
Colet were among his pupils. Oxford at this time presented a
spectacle which seems to have struck the imagination of all her
foreign visitors. Three hundred halls and grammar-schools, besides
her noble colleges and religious houses, furnished means of education
to a far larger number of students than resort thither at the
present time. The English universities, though admitting the new
learning, still adhered to the scholastic philosophy&mdash;a fact which
formed the groundwork of those charges brought against them by
some of their contemporaries, and re-echoed by Wood, of being
behind their time. It is not very easy to determine what was the
precise state of the English schools at the opening of the sixteenth
century. On the one hand, it is clear that the revival of classical
literature found plenty of enthusiastic supporters among English
scholars; and, if we are to draw any conclusions as to the nature of
English education of this time from Sir John Elyot’s treatise of “The
Governor,” we should be disposed to think that children of the
upper classes were then expected to begin their classical studies
while still in their cradles. A nobleman’s son, he says, should have
none about him, not even his nurses, who cannot speak pure and
eloquent Latin. At the very least, their English should be clean,
polite, perfect, and articulately pronounced, omitting no letter or
syllable. At seven, a boy is to begin his Greek and Latin grammars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_673"></a>[673]</span>
together; and at twelve he is supposed to have so completely made
the Latin tongue his own that he need no more apply himself to its
study, but confine his labours to Greek. The whole treatise, which
is in many respects valuable and interesting, proves that the writer
had imbibed that tiresome form of classical enthusiasm which wears
you out with its illustrations from the ancients. Even the necessity
of religion is supported by an appeal to the examples of Romulus
and Numa Pompilius, though, accidentally, we are allowed to peep
into the old Catholic nursery, and see the children “knelyng in thir
games before ymages, and holdyng up thir litel white handes, movyng
thir mouths as if they were praieing, or going and singyng, as it were
in procession.” This treatise, published in 1531, plainly infers that
at that time a noble youth was expected to begin his studies very
early, and to aim at something more than the name of a scholar.
On the other hand, there was a certain prejudice in favour of foreign
academies, which induced those who in all ages make it their business
to follow the fashion, to undervalue Eton and Oxford, and to
consider you a Goth or a rustic if you had not graduated in some
Italian university. The mediæval spirit which still hung about the
cloisters of Oxford was quite out of harmony with the prevailing
tastes; and undoubtedly those same cloisters sheltered many worthy
Conservatives of the old school who clung to Aristotle and Oxford
Latin, and thought very little of the new-fangled Platonists.</p>

<p>Hence, those who desired to imbue themselves with classic literature
generally found their way to Italy, and the rage for a foreign
education had become so excessive that Barclay introduces an
allusion to it in his “Ship of Fooles:”&mdash;</p>

<p>The reproach conveyed in the last line was probably deserved by
some whose foreign scholarship was only sought for fashion’s sake;
but it does not certainly apply to the knot of illustrious Englishmen
whom we find studying in the Italian schools at the close of the fifteenth
century. Among them was Richard Pace, who had been
brought up in the household of Langton, Bishop of Winchester, and
had been sent by his patron to study at Padua, where he had Latymer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_674"></a>[674]</span>
and Cuthbert Tonstall for his tutors; William Linacre, who had
repaired to Florence and been received into the family of Lorenzo
de’ Medici, who, charmed with his modesty and talents, chose him
for the companion of his son’s studies: and the amiable and simple-hearted
William Lily, whose Greek learning had been acquired at
Rhodes, and who was then perfecting himself in Latin literature in
the schools of Rome and Florence. Colet also made the tour of
Italy, after taking his degree at Magdalen, and on coming back to
England, he returned a second time to Oxford, where in 1497 he
found Grocyn and Linacre delivering public lectures on Greek.
Their audience was at first a small one, for the new learning was
regarded with no little jealousy and suspicion in many quarters, and
parties ran high between the Greeks and the Trojans, as the adherents
of the opposite factions were commonly called. The Greeks
expended their wit on the dulness of their adversaries, whom they
represented as “sleepy, surly fellows, who talked bad Latin, and
never said a smart or clever thing;” whilst the Trojans denounced
their brilliant rivals as dangerous innovators. The truth lay pretty
evenly between the two parties. The Oxford studies were possibly
in some respects behind the time, and not merely profane, but sacred
learning also appears, from Wood’s account, to have been at a low
ebb; and for this, as has been elsewhere shown, the lawyers and the
logicians, the Lollards and the Anti-Roman party, must share the
blame among them. Still, when we remember the enthusiasm with
which men like More and Erasmus regarded the English universities,
it is difficult to believe that sound and solid learning can have been
entirely wanting at Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and considering what sort of clouds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_675"></a>[675]</span>
hung on the horizon, the “Scotists,” perhaps, did not show themselves
such dull fellows after all, when they warned their disciples to
keep clear of foreign fashions, and set afloat the well-known proverb,
“Let the Greeks beware of heresy.”</p>

<p>Colet did not hesitate to join the party of the Greeks, and to this
he was moved not merely by a love of polite literature, but by the
contempt and aversion which he had conceived for the scholastic
philosophy. At Florence he had not only attended the Greek
lectures of Politian and Demetrius Chalycondylus, but he had
listened to the preaching of Savonarola, from whom he had caught
an enthusiasm for Scriptural studies, and a burning zeal for the
reform of abuses. So soon, therefore, as he had been ordained
deacon he flung aside the Master of the Sentences, and began to
read public lectures on the Epistles of St. Paul, though with
characteristic temper he had disdained to receive any degrees in
Divinity, accounting the studies which he should have had to engage
in for that purpose as wholly empty and unprofitable. His earnest
eloquence and original mode of treatment drew him more hearers
than the classic erudition of Grocyn had been able to command, and
there was not a doctor of law or divinity in the whole university, but
gladly came to hear the young preacher, bringing their books with
them.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Erasmus paid his first visit to England,
having been invited over by Lord Mountjoy, his former pupil at
Paris. Erasmus at this time supported himself partly by his tutorships,
and partly by the pensions which he received from the
sovereigns who sought to attach him to their Courts, and from the
learned friends whose pecuniary assistance he availed himself of with
considerable freedom. At Oxford he was received into St. Mary’s
Priory by the kind-hearted Prior Charnock, and in his letters expresses
the singular delight which he felt at all he heard and all he saw.
He soon made acquaintance with Colet, and was by him introduced
to More, then studying at Magdalen, and to Wolsey, bursar of the
same college; and in company with these new friends (he wrote to
Mountjoy) he would be content to live all his days in the farthest
extremity of Scythia. In short, he drew so brilliant a picture of the
pleasant hours they spent in one another’s company, that Mountjoy,
who was but just married, could not resist the temptation of running
down to Oxford, and beginning a fresh course of study under his
old master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_676"></a>[676]</span></p>

<p>The friendship that sprang up from that time between Erasmus
and Colet was strong and enduring. Yet no two men could be more
unlike in their real character, however much their literary tastes may
have coincided. Colet was heart and soul in earnest, and herein lay
the strength and nobleness of a disposition which, as his friend owns,
had in it many a dash of human infirmity. “When he speaks,”
writes Erasmus, “you would think he was more than man: it is not
with voice alone, but with eyes, and countenance, and with his whole
demeanour.” He was of a hot and haughty spirit, and impatient of
the least affront, qualities which imparted a certain harshness and
vehemence to all his words and actions. Yet he had (and who has
not?) his softer side, and the stern and fiery orator, as rigid and
severe to himself as he was to others, was a lover of children, and
delighted to make himself little with little ones, whom he compared
to the angels, though, as we shall presently see, his love even of
them was somewhat lacking in tenderness. Erasmus himself was
not likely to be led into the excesses to which a nature like Colet’s
easily betrays itself. There was no real earnestness about him.
Had he not left his Epistles behind him, we might be amazed that
one so deficient in every sterling quality of soul could have found a
way to the hearts of all with whom he associated. But his letters
explain the mystery. There was no resisting the charm of his wit,
and his extraordinary gift of treating every subject on which he
touched in the way that was most agreeable. After the lapse of
three hundred years, the reader, who possesses nothing but the dead
written letter of that graceful eloquence, feels its indescribable magic,
the “certain Erasmianism,” as Colet calls it, and is carried away
against his will by the bewitching pleasantry of a writer whose whole
life he knows to have been contemptible. There was, moreover,
one most attractive quality which he shared with More: nothing was
able to ruffle his temper; and he had the happiest ways of restraining
the sallies of his more fiery companions, and preventing their table
talk after dinner from ever ending in a quarrel. Thus, on one
occasion, when a disputation had arisen upon the sin of Cain,
Erasmus, who judged by Colet’s sparkling eyes that the conversation
had lasted long enough, and wished to end it, invented on the spot
a story from some pretended ancient author, by which ingenious
fraud the argument was broken off, and the company parted in the
best of humours. He was moreover an advocate for moderation in
all things, even in hostility to the scholastics, and once took up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_677"></a>[677]</span>
defence of St. Thomas against the attacks of Colet, and represented
that the Angelic doctor really did seem to have studied the Scriptures.
But this time Colet bore him down, and could not contain
his impatience at hearing a word said in favour of one whose dogmatic
definitions of theology he hesitated not to accuse of arrogance.
More held an equal place in the affections of both his friends; he
had all the wit of Erasmus without his flippancy, and all the earnestness
of Colet without his asperity of temper. He chose the latter as
his director, and learnt from him a singular love for the inspired
writings, and many precious secrets of self-mastery and mortification;
but he had some spiritual instincts to which Colet was an utter
stranger; and while the one was venting his annoyance at what he
deemed the childish superstitions of the Canterbury pilgrims, as he
watched them crowding to kiss the relics of St. Thomas à Becket,
the other, with truer humility, thought it not beneath the character
of a man of letters to feed his faith at the homely springs of popular
devotion, and visited many an old English shrine on foot&mdash;a rare
thing in those days, when even the common people went on horse-back.</p>

<p>We will pass over a few years, which brought their usual changes
to the Oxford friends in all save the mutual regard which they bore
for one another. The princely boy to whom Erasmus had first been
introduced in his schoolroom, and who had won his heart by challenging
him to reply to a Latin epistle, was now on the throne, “tall
in body, and mighty in will,” says Stow, “and so prosperous in his
kingdom, that it was called ‘The Golden Realm.’” Wolsey, whom
we left a Demy of Magdalen, was now Cardinal, and had just succeeded
Warham as chancellor, having the learned Richard Pace for
his secretary. The European politics which he sought to guide had
not made him neglect the cause of letters:&mdash;</p>

<p>Good Bishop Fisher was hard at work introducing Greek studies
at Cambridge, where Croke was delivering lectures, and where the
new learning was better received than it had been at Oxford. The
noble Countess of Richmond<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> had founded her two Cambridge colleges,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_678"></a>[678]</span>
her grammar-school at Wimbourne, and her “Lady Margaret”
professorships; Fox, now Bishop of Winchester, was drawing up the
statutes of Corpus Christi, that classical beehive, as he was pleased
to term it, in which he provided for the study of Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew, under the professors or “herbalists,” who were for ever to
drive all barbarism out of the bee-garden, and provide that the best
classical authors should be read by his students. Linacre was now
the royal physician and a man of importance; he had translated
Galen, founded two lectureships at Oxford, and the College of
Physicians, but at this moment he was contemplating whether it
might not be well to give up professional fame and Court favour,
in order to die a priest; and this design he afterwards executed.
Grocyn, too, had ably maintained his scholar’s reputation, and was
universally respected as long as he lived, says Erasmus, for his chaste
and holy life. In the judgment of that critic, however, his firm
adherence to Catholic dogma was somewhat excessive, and bordered
on superstition, and he considers it necessary to apologise for this
weakness on the part of his friend, who, he says, had from childhood
been trained in the scholastic theology, and was exceedingly
learned in questions of ecclesiastical discipline. More, whose
early inclination for the cloister had yielded to the persuasions of
his director Colet, had married and embraced a professional career;
he had written his Utopia, and was struggling hard to preserve his
independence, and keep out of the royal service, into which others
so eagerly sought admittance. He desired nothing better than to be
suffered to enjoy in freedom his happy Chelsea home, where it was
his delight to direct the education of his children, to gather around
him his learned friends, and relieve the intervals of business with
polite and Christian studies. In that family circle Erasmus always
found a place during his visits to England, and it is to him that we
owe the charming portraiture of a household, the venerable memory
of which has sunk into the English heart and become almost the
typical example of an English home. As to Erasmus himself, his
course during the same period is easily told: he had published his
Greek Testament and his learned editions of the Fathers, and had
thereby earned a European reputation; he had flitted about from
England to Paris, from Paris to Germany, from Germany back
again to England, and thence to Rome. Courted, flattered, and
admired by all, he was the great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bel-esprit</i> of the day, and the lighter
productions of his pen were telling upon public opinion, much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_679"></a>[679]</span>
perhaps in the same sort of way that clever journalism affects it in
our own day. He was directing his keen powers of ridicule against
some real abuses, but at the same time his mocking wit was recklessly
striking at sacred things and bringing them into popular contempt.
In his “Praise of Folly,” and his “Adages,” he had hit
hard at popes, cardinals, pilgrimages, devotions to the saints, and
indulgences, but above all at monks and friars, whom he invariably
holds up to execration, as something too pitiably vile and puerile
to be endured by men of sense. In short, to use the oft-quoted
saying, he had laid the egg which Luther was to hatch, and though
he afterwards resented this charge, and was wont to say that he had
laid a hen’s egg, and Luther had hatched it a crow’s, yet, as Hallam
has shrewdly remarked, whatever were the bird, it pecked hard
against the Church and her religious orders. His mode of warfare
was to paint every one who opened his lips in defence of the old
order of things as a half-witted ignoramus, and to bespatter his
adversaries with epithets and witticisms, in an easy flowing style
which everybody read and everybody laughed at; and when the
laugh was once raised the victory was more than half won.</p>

<p>It remains to speak of Colet, now Dean of St. Paul’s, who had
steadily followed out the purpose to which he had devoted himself
at Oxford, had given himself up heart and soul to the task of reviving
the study of Scriptural Divinity, and was opposing himself like
a rock to every form of practical corruption. At this distance of
time it is not easy for us to satisfy ourselves as to the real character
of one who has left nothing but his fame behind him, and whose
views and teaching are to be gathered, not from his own writings but
from the epistolary correspondence of Erasmus, whose narrative is
naturally coloured by the bias of his own mind.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> In those days of
Court sycophancy, we cannot but admire the courageous independence
of such a man, and the single-hearted fervour with which he
set himself to reform his chapter, to expound the gospel to the
people, and to urge upon his fellow clergy a strict observance of the
canons. In his sermon preached before Convocation, in 1511, he
chose for his text the words of St. Paul: “Be ye not conformed to
this world;” and thundered out in plain, strong, and noble words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_680"></a>[680]</span>
his denunciation of those abuses which he called the “matter of
the Church’s reformation;” such as “the worldly lives of the
prelates,” “their hunting and hawking,” and “their covetousness
after high promotions.” The reformation he said must begin with
my “reverend Fathers the Lord Bishops,” whom he prayed to excuse
his boldness, for he spoke out of very zeal for Holy Church. In this
famous sermon there is doubtless something too much of asperity,
yet it does not seem to have been taken amiss. The single-hearted
honesty of the speaker was understood and appreciated by his hearers;
and it must be added that his own example added force to his words.
Colet was a man of pure and blameless life, simple and austere in
manners, and ready to spend himself for what he deemed the cause
of Christ. His exhortations had extraordinary success; other ecclesiastics
were animated to greater zeal in the discharge of their pastoral
duties, and began to preach to their people on sermons and festival
days. Divinity lectures, too, were delivered in the church of St.
Paul, both by the Dean, and certain learned men whom he invited
to assist him, and these lectures were no longer permitted to take
the form of dry disputations, but were chiefly commentaries on the
Scriptures, particularly on the Epistles of St. Paul, with which Colet
was so enamoured, says Erasmus, that he seemed to be wholly wrapped
up in them. With all his classical tastes he thought less of manner
than of matter, in his public orations. Scriptural simplicity was what
he aimed at; he wanted, to use his own rather uncourteous phrase,
to “clear away the cobwebs of the schoolmen from the plain text of
the Bible.” He did not altogether neglect the study of style, and
sometimes condescended to read Chaucer and other English poets
for the purpose of improving his diction. But in general his thoughts
came out too hot and molten for him to deliberate much in what
words to utter them, and the careful polish which Erasmus bestowed
on his writings was viewed by him as more worthy of a pedagogue
than of a preacher, who has his heart full of big thoughts and is in
haste to utter them.</p>

<p>How little there was of a courtier about him may be gathered from
the sermon which he preached before the king at the time when he
was preparing for his French war, in which, instead of offering that
monarch the welcome incense of flattery, he very plainly expounded
to his hearers the sin which Christian princes committed by wars of
ambition, in which they fought, not under the banner of Christ, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_681"></a>[681]</span>
under that of the devil.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Much of this was surely excellent; and had
this been all, we should be ready to yield our hearty sympathy to
Colet in spite of those “specks of human infirmity” which his best
friends saw and regretted. A reformer has rough work to do, and
in doing it has need of a certain fund of audacity which easily overpasses
the just bounds of discretion, and can scarcely avoid wounding
the susceptibilities of those whom he undertakes to amend. Yet
such things are easily pardoned in them whom we know to be only
“zealous for the Lord of Hosts,” and who cannot “restrain their
lips” when they declare His justice in the midst of the people. But
there were other elements in the character of Colet from which we
instinctively shrink, for the simple reason that they betray a mind
out of harmony with the teachings of faith. We have already seen
him bringing the charge of arrogance&mdash;himself surely with greater
arrogance&mdash;against the Angelic doctor, unable to repress his intolerance
of what he deemed his too strict definitions of doctrine; and
betraying an angry contempt for the popular devotions sanctioned
by the Church, but which <em>he</em> impeached of superstition. That practical
abuses may easily have crept into many of these devotions
is what no Catholic will think himself called on to deny, and that
where they existed they deserved to be exposed and denounced is
equally obvious; yet when we find that the only <em>fact</em> alluded to by
Colet’s biographer as having stirred the wrath of the reformer was
the eagerness displayed by the Canterbury pilgrims to kiss the shoe
of St. Thomas, preserved there as a relic, we are disposed to think
that it was not merely these supposed abuses, but the devotions
themselves which he regarded with dislike. And this judgment is
confirmed when we find him betraying a similar want of sympathy
with the spirit and practice of the Church in cases where there could
be no question of superstition. He set very little store by the practice
of daily hearing or saying Mass: he considered the recitation
of the Divine Office in private by priests to be both a burdensome
and a superfluous duty, and seems to have been, to say the least,
indifferent to the value of prayer for the dead. All this we learn
from the correspondence of Erasmus, who further informs us that
there were a vast number of opinions received in the schools from
which Colet strongly dissented, and that he not only read the works<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_682"></a>[682]</span>
of heretical writers without scruple, but was accustomed to say that
he often learned more out of them than he did from orthodox writers,
who were content to be always running over a beaten track.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> It can
therefore be no great matter of surprise that Colet, before long,
became involved in trouble. While some men regarded him as little
short of a saint, others, alarmed at his bold views and the uncompromising
language in which he expressed them, looked on him as
an incipient heretic, and as such denounced him to his bishop.
Articles were drawn up against him and laid before the Primate, but
Warham dismissed the case as frivolous, and Colet was never afterwards
interfered with on account of his liberty of speech.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus, and after him Fox, tells us that the three articles of
accusation referred to his manner of treating the worship of images,
his preaching against the worldly lives of the clergy, and his complaints
of those who read their sermons in a cold and formal manner;
vague charges, which would be very justly designated as “frivolous.”
Tyndale, however, in his usual burlesque style, declares in his
“Reply to More,” that “the bishop would have made Colet a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_683"></a>[683]</span>
heretic for translating the Pater Noster into English,” and this
random shot has been gravely taken up and handed on from one
author to another as a sober bit of history. “He <em>even</em> gave the
people parts of the Bible in English,” says a Scotch reviewer, “such
as the Lord’s Prayer!” Whilst Knight seriously assures his readers
that not only were the English Scriptures at this time utterly unknown,
but that “<em>there was scarce so much as a Latin Testament in
any cathedral church in England</em>.”</p>

<p>Colet’s friendship with More and Erasmus meanwhile remained
unbroken, and in the intervals of graver duties the three friends
were wont to meet at the house of Dame Christian Colet, the Dean’s
mother, in the (then) pleasant country suburb of Stepney, of which
parish Colet was vicar. Erasmus has sketched the good old lady in
her 90th year, with her countenance “still so fair and cheerful, you
would think she had never shed a tear;” and Colet lets us know the
pleasure which she found in receiving her son’s guests, and in their
agreeable and witty conversation. Stepney, with its green lanes,
fresh country air, and rural population, would often picture itself to
the eye of More when he grew weary of his life in town; and in his
early married days, when his narrow means obliged him to content
himself with a house in Bucklersbury, the hardworked lawyer was
glad enough, like other cockneys, to run down to Stepney on
Saturday afternoons, and refresh himself with the merry talk of his
friends, as they sauntered in the trimly-kept gardens and admired the
noble strawberries brought over from Holland, or the damask roses
lately introduced into England by Linacre.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently the party included some of the learned
foreigners who just then crowded the Tudor Court, such as Andreas
Ammonius,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> the king’s Latin secretary, whom Erasmus praises as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_684"></a>[684]</span>
being “so noble and generous, so free from envy, and so full of
great endowments,” or their old Oxford crony, John Sixtine, a
Frisian by birth, but now naturalised in England, and esteemed by
all good scholars for his versatile genius. It seems strange to us in
these days to associate the names of foreign canonists and divines
with our country parish churches, of which, however, they not unfrequently
enjoyed the revenues. Hidden in a sequestered valley of
Devonshire, surrounded by woods that are dear to village children
for the sweet-scented violets that grow there in such wild profusion,
shut in by hills which they will not easily forget who have seen their
sloping fields all bright with golden sheaves, made brighter with the
intense sunshine that seems borrowed from a southern sky; the
tourist may perhaps have stumbled on the little church of St.
Blaze of Haccombe, with its quaint encaustic tiles and cross-legged
effigies of the crusading lords of Haccombe, all as perfect as in the
days of John Sixtine, the friend of More and Erasmus, who was
arch-priest of the college formerly attached to this church by Sir
Stephen de Haccombe, to the end that perpetual prayer might be
made there for the souls of his ancestors. Dr. Sixtine had other
more splendid and lucrative benefices, but the beauty of that little
rural valley seems to have clung to his heart, and among the various
bequests which he names in his will, appears the sum of fifteen
pounds in honour of God and St. Blaze, towards the reparation of
the church of Haccombe. Let the good deed be noted here, as
well as the kind and homely feeling which induced him to direct
that twenty pounds should be distributed among his parishioners at
Eglescliffe, “to buy them instruments necessary for their country
labours.”</p>

<p>Both these distinguished men were frequent visitors to Stepney,
and in the pleasant conferences which Colet held with the familiar
coterie, one project of his must often have furnished them with a
topic of conversation: it was his wish to found a school. Schools,
indeed, there already were in rich abundance; during the last thirty
years a very harvest of them had been springing up all over
England, but none yet founded were quite to Colet’s mind. He
desired to see an academy in which there should be laid a solid
foundation of learning, both sacred and profane. Classical, or what
he termed “clene Latin,” the fashionable study of Greek, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_685"></a>[685]</span>
Scriptural divinity, would never, he argued, establish themselves in
the universities until they were first taught in preparatory schools;
and he pleased himself with the thought of attaching such a
grammar-school to his own church of St Paul’s, and bestowing his
wealth and his study in bringing it to perfection. He hoped to raise
a generation of scholars who should be trained to understand the
true sense and spirit of the classical authors, so as to read, write, and
speak the learned tongues with ease and elegance; and who, at the
same time, should have gone through a careful course of religious
instruction; a large-hearted design, which met the warm approval of
his literary friends, and of none more than of Erasmus.</p>

<p>The school was accordingly commenced in 1509, at the east end
of St. Paul’s churchyard. The front next the church was finished in
the year following, and bore this inscription:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Schola catechizationis
puerorum in Christi Opt. Max. fide et bonis literis, Anno Christi,
MDX</i>. The endowments provided for the free education of one
hundred and fifty-three scholars,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and for the maintenance of a
master, usher, and chaplain. The school, when complete, was
divided into four parts. First the porch, where those whom Colet
called his catechumens were instructed in religion, no one being admitted
who could not at least say the catechism and know how to
read and write. Then came a room for the lower class taught by
the usher, and a third for the higher class taught by the master.
The captain of each form had a little desk to mark his pre-eminence,
and the apartments were only divided by curtains. Lastly, there was
a small chapel opening into the schoolroom, where Mass was said
daily. The children, however, were not intended to <em>hear</em> Mass
daily, for, according to Colet’s views, this would have been a waste
of time. Unlike Bede and Alfred, he was ignorant of what has been
called the grand secret of education, “the way how to lose time
wisely.” Week-day Masses were in his eyes simple superfluities, and
he judged the moments so consumed much better spent in study.
In accordance with this principle, he himself only said Mass on
Sundays and festivals, and argued that he spent the time thus saved
more profitably in arranging the matter for his sermons! His
scholars, indeed, had their Mass said <em>for</em> them every morning in the
chapel; but the statutes enjoined that when the Sacring bell was
heard, they should only prostrate until after the Elevation, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_686"></a>[686]</span>
rise and go on with their studies. What a revelation of character
appears in traits like these, and how wide a distance separates such
a tone of spirituality from that of the monastic scholars! How
little of the spirit of faith was likely to be imbibed during this daily
lesson of irreverence, and what could have been the theory which
this much-vaunted director possessed of the spiritual life, when he
practically taught his pupils by word and example to value work
above prayer, and to save time for study by cutting short their
Mass! Yet Colet designed this as a <em>Catechetical</em> school, and intended
it to be a nursery of Christian piety. The image of the child
Jesus stood on the master’s seat in the attitude of teaching, with the
apposite inscription, “Hear ye Him.” The children were instructed
to regard Him as the Master of the school, and as they went and
came, to bow to His image and salute Him with a brief hymn. Thrice
a day, moreover, they were to prostrate, and recite appointed
prayers; in short, there were not wanting provisions of a religious
character, only much of the true spirit of Catholic devotion had
been pared away.</p>

<p>The statutes regarding recreation were drawn up with Puritanic
rigorism. Old traditions on this head met with small indulgence at
the hands of the reforming founder, and hardening his heart to all
the infirmities of the schoolboy nature, he strictly forbade Shrovetide
cock-fighting and the disputations of St. Bartholomew’s day,
which he denounced as “idle babbling.” The abolition of cock-fighting
was beyond all praise, but I grieve to add that there were
absolutely no play days. Nay, so rigid was this rule, that the
master was to forfeit forty shillings every time he broke it, unless at
the request of an archbishop, bishop, or king. But, strange to say,
there was a special provision for the due celebration of Childermas
day, when they were all to repair to St. Paul’s church, hear the
child-bishop’s sermon, assist at the High Mass, and offer his lordship
a penny. The studies were to consist of good Greek and Latin
authors, <em>especially Christian ones</em>, “for my intent is,” writes the
founder, “by this scole specially to increase the knowledge and
worshipping of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and good Christian
life and manners in the children.” But whilst giving this preference
to Christian over Pagan authors he requires “the verrye Romayne
eloquence” to be taught, and warming at the bare notion of
Scholastic barbarism ever invading his seminary, “will utterly have
banished and excluded all such abusion as the later blind world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_687"></a>[687]</span>
hath brought in, which is rather to be called <em>bloterature</em> than
<em>literature</em>.”</p>

<p>Colet had no difficulty in finding a master fully qualified to undertake
the direction of this academy. William Lily, the god-son and
pupil of Grocyn, and the fellow-student of More, the very ideal of a
humble, devout, and unworldly scholar, who had never yet thought
of making his learning a way to fortune, but was still plodding on as
a poor London pedagogue, was at once promoted to the mastership
of St. Paul’s, with John Rightwyse for his usher. The next step
was to draw up a little book for the use of his scholars containing
the rudiments of grammar, and an abridgment of Christian doctrine;
and this little book, commonly called Paul’s Accidence, was dedicated
by Colet to Lily. Herein we find the creed in Latin and
English, the seven sacraments, brief explanations of the love of God,
and our duty to ourselves and our neighbours, including precepts
for the observance of appointed fasts and holy days, and some rules
of holy living, with a beautiful Latin prayer to “the Child Jesus,
Master of this school,” and two others for daily use, one for parents,
and another for the virtue of docility.</p>

<p>In his preface to his “Rudiments,” Colet apologises for writing
on a subject whereon so many had written before him, but explains
his purpose to have been the putting things in a clear order for the
use of young wits, out of compassion to the tenderness and small
capacity of little minds. “I pray God,” he continues, “that all may
be to His honour and the erudition of children. Wherefore I pray
you all, lytel babes, learn gladly this lytel treatise, and commende it
dyligently unto your memorye, trusting that ye shall proceed and
growe to perfyte literature, and come to be grete clerkes. And lyfte
up your lytel whyte hands for me also, which prayeth for you to God.”</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn687" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Wolsey reprinted this little manuel” changed to “Wolsey reprinted this little manual”.">Wolsey reprinted this little manual</ins> for the use of his Ipswich
scholars, recommending it to the masters in an epistle from his own
pen. In 1513 the indefatigable founder resolved on providing his
boys with something more complete. Grammars, indeed, there were
in plenty; there was the old Donatus, and the more modern “Lac
puerorum” of good Master Holte,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and a host of others whose quaint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_688"></a>[688]</span>
names and flimsy contents have been whimsically criticised by
Erasmus. But they did not satisfy the requirements of Colet, and
he accordingly composed his treatise on the Eight Parts of Speech,
which, with some alterations and considerable additions, forms the
syntax of the grammar which afterwards bore the name of Lily’s
grammar. After Lily had revised and corrected the manuscript,
Colet put it into the hands of Erasmus, who made so many alterations,
that neither of them could in justice call the work his own,
and in 1515 it was published, with an epistle from Erasmus. After
its publication Lily drew up the rules, known as the <cite>Propria quæ
maribus</cite>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">As in præsenti</i>, his usher Rightwyse adding some
finishing touches. About the same time Linacre was engaged on a
somewhat similar work, but his “Compendium of Grammar,” originally
drawn up for the use of the Princess Mary, was judged by Colet
rather too abstruse for the comprehension of beginners, and he did
not, therefore, admit it into his school. This seems to have been
resented by the sensitive grammarian, and Erasmus had to interpose
to restore a good understanding between him and the dean.</p>

<p>Lily proved an excellent master, and among his first pupils were
the famous antiquary Leland and Thomas Lupset, son to Colet’s
amanuensis, who was afterwards admitted to close intimacy by More
and Reginald Pole. One fault, however, appeared in the management
of the school, too common at that time, namely, the excessive
severity of the discipline. This is perhaps to be charged partly to
the account of Colet, whose views were as austere in what regarded
the education of children, as they were in the direction of souls; and
partly to the influence of Rightwyse, who was a scholar of Eton, and
brought with him thence maxims of school government, which were
exceedingly harsh, not to say cruel. In fact, since education had
passed from the hands of the monastics into those of professional
pedagogues, the paternal spirit which formerly presided over the
Catholic schoolroom had been gradually fading away. It seemed
agreed by all that the Greek grammar, and the “verrye Romayne
eloquence,” could not be attained without an unsparing use of the
rod; for we find the same complaint of cruelty made of the French
professors of the time. In England this unmerciful system kept its
ground throughout the whole of the Tudor period, and we find Sir
John Elyot advising his “governor” to provoke a child to study with
a pleasant face, and deprecating “cruel and yrous masters, by whom
the wits of children be dulled, whereof we need no better witness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_689"></a>[689]</span>
than daily experience.” The Eton fashion was to flog a boy directly
he appeared in the school, as a sort of entrance fee, of which old
Tusser dolefully complains;<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and something of this sort of discipline
existed at St. Paul’s, and was supported by the approval of Colet.</p>

<p>To the credit of Erasmus, it must be said that he strongly condemned
such severity; he knew from his own experience that
brutal tutors ruin many a hopeful lad, and advocated the milder
system of teaching, which he himself followed with so much success.
He was wont to quote the example of Spensippus, who would have
pictures of joy and gladness to be set round his school: and in his
tract on education, quotes with pleasure the story of an English
gentleman, who seeing that his little son was very fond of archery,
bought him a bow and arrows, and painted them with the letters of
the Greek alphabet. The capitals were marked on the butt, and
whenever the child had hit a letter and could tell the name of it, he
was rewarded with a cherry.</p>

<p>This was not at all in Colet’s way, and Erasmus tells a frightful
story of the cruelty which he himself witnessed&mdash;practised under his
direction. “I once knew a certain theologian,” he says, “who must
needs have masters who were zealous floggers. He esteemed this
an excellent means for subduing all asperity of character, and mastering
the wantonness of youth. Never did he sit down to a repast
with his disciples, but at the end of the meal some one or other of
them was brought out to be flogged; and his cruelty was sometimes
exercised on the innocent, merely to accustom them to stripes. I
was once standing by when he thus called out from dinner a boy of,
I should think, ten years old, who had recently come to the school
from his mother. He began by saying that his mother was a most
pious woman, and had specially recommended the boy to his care,
and then that he might have an opportunity of flogging him, he
charged him with I know not what atrocity, and made a sign to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_690"></a>[690]</span>
prefect of the school to give him a flogging. The latter at once
knocked the boy down, and beat him as if he had committed a
sacrilege. The doctor called out several times, ‘Enough, enough,’
but the savage went on with his barbarity, till the boy almost
swooned. Then turning to us, the doctor quietly observed that he
had not merited any punishment, but that it was done to humble his
spirit. Who would treat his bondslave in such a way? nay, I may
say, who would thus treat his ass?”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Though Colet is not named
in this passage, yet he is generally believed to have been the “theologian”
in question, the prefect of discipline being no other than his
usher, Rightwyse.</p>

<p>We gather from Colet’s letters to his friend, that on one point of
opinion they greatly differed, namely, in the view they took of
religious life. Erasmus, when he speaks of monks, forgets his usual
politeness, and descends to a style of which Luther might have been
proud. They are designated as “foul and noxious insects, which it is
a sort of pollution to touch; creatures so detested and so detestable,
that it is regarded as an ill omen to meet one in the street; dolts
and idiots, who think it a mark of consummate piety not to be able
to read; wretched beings, who are distinguished by a certain
obstinate malignity of disposition, and who think that they are
charming the ears of the saints when, with asinine voices, they bray
out their psalms in choir.” One is ashamed to transcribe such
language, and to remember that the greatest scholar of his time
considered it to be wit.</p>

<p>But Colet was of another mind. He condemned the relaxed life
led in many religious houses; but there was a theory of monasticism
which he loved and admired. It was hardly the Catholic theory of
religious life, for Colet’s dream seems to have been to have found
some retreat where he could have spent the close of life with a few
chosen friends of kindred tastes, living and conversing with them
after the manner of the ancient philosophers. He even set on foot
inquiries, to discover if any house suitable for his purpose existed
in Italy or Germany; but finding none to his mind, he built himself
a residence adjoining the Carthusian monastery at Shene, whither
he often retired, and purposed withdrawing there altogether, and
giving up all his public engagements that he might prepare in quiet
for his end. In his last letter to Erasmus, we see that his old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_691"></a>[691]</span>
interests were fast losing their hold upon him as he felt the sands of
life running out. His friend had sent him some of Reuchlin’s
Cabalistic works. “O Erasmus,” he replies, “of books and knowledge
there is no end. There is no better thing in this world than a
holy life, and no other way to attain it than by the earnest love and
imitation of Jesus. Wherefore, leaving all wandering paths, this, to
the best of my ability, is what I long for.” He made all his last dispositions,
therefore, bestowing extraordinary care in drawing up his
will, in which there occurs no word suggestive of suffrages for his soul;
a fact which shows, that if he did not condemn the practice of praying
for the dead, he at any rate attached no value to it. Death overtook
him sooner than he anticipated, and in the year 1519 he expired at
his favourite retreat, almost at the moment when Luther was making
his mock submission to the Sovereign Pontiff.</p>

<p>What shall we say of the character of this celebrated man? a
strong and earnest one it was, no doubt; one that loved justice and
hated iniquity, and had a zeal for the interests of God. Erasmus
somewhere speaks of his “passionate admiration for the wonderful
majesty of Christ.” Nor in judging him must we forget that he lived
in an age when worldliness had infected the high places in the
Church; and that, if his denunciation of abuses was often arrogant,
there were plenty of abuses to denounce. Yet granting all this, our
readers will long ago have agreed on their verdict. From such a
type of Catholicism, they will say, in which we see piety without
unction, austerity without sweetness, and an absence&mdash;if not of faith&mdash;at
least of all its tenderest instincts; from such a form of godliness,
over which the coming spectre of Lutheranism had already
projected somewhat of its baneful shadow, may the schools and
scholars of England be long preserved! Such characters, if we cannot
impeach them of formal heresy, yet indicate a woful wane of faith,
and fully explain the significance of those rules<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> left by St. Ignatius
to his disciples, wherein he taught them how to conform their sentiments
to the sentiments of the Catholic Church. He was not
content with bidding them hold fast to her creeds, but would have
them esteem and speak highly of all her minor practices of devotion.
For these, in the judgment of one of the most sagacious among the
saints, are the pulses by which we count the heart-beatings of the
true believer; and in Colet these were silent. Though he died a
Catholic, therefore, Protestants unanimously claim him as one of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_692"></a>[692]</span>
precursors; and his panegyric, from which we gather all that is
known of his life, was drawn up by Erasmus for the edification of his
Lutheran friend, the notorious Dr. Jonas Jodocus.</p>

<p>The mention of Shene may fitly introduce a younger and more
illustrious scholar, who had received his early education in that
monastery, and who, at the time of Colet’s death, was studying at
Oxford, and was received as a frequent and welcome visitor in the
family circle of Sir Thomas More. Reginald Pole was then a youth
of nineteen, exhibiting both the comely dignity of his Plantagenet
blood, and a promise of intellectual excellence that was not belied
by his after career. From Shene he had passed on to Oxford, and
at Corpus Christi College, under the tuition of Linacre and Latymer,
had thrown himself heart and soul into classical studies. Though
he afterwards in great part laid them aside, in order more exclusively
to devote himself to sacred letters, yet he always retained the style
of a polished Latinist, as all his writings testify. Young as he was,
he had secured the friendship of More, and was often admitted into
the family circle and the happy schoolroom of Chelsea. In a letter
to his daughter Margaret, More speaks of the admiration he had
expressed on reading one of his Latin epistles, and calls him “not
so noble by birth as he is by learning and virtue;” while Pole, on
his side, was wont in after years to boast of the friendship of More
and Fisher as something he valued more highly than the familiarity
of all the princes of Christendom.</p>

<p>The society at this time gathered round the English Court was
extraordinarily brilliant. Besides a throng of native scholars, it
included several illustrious foreigners, such as Ludovicus Vives, the
Spanish Quinctilian, as he was called, who condescended to direct
the education of the Princess Mary. Three queens graced the royal
circle, one of them the consort of Henry, and the other two his
widowed sisters of France and Scotland. The poets and pageant-makers
of the time racked their fancies to find new ways of introducing
the Tudor roses white and red and the rich pomegranates of
Arragon (the devices of the royal dames), and to make the most of
a Court illuminated by three crowned beauties. Erasmus is never
weary of praising the king, the queen, the cardinal, and the bishops;
they are all patrons of letters, the Court is the seat of the Muses, and
might vie with Athens in the days of Pericles. The queen is as
virtuous as she is learned; she daily reads the English Scriptures,
spends six hours at her prayers and kneels all the time without a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_693"></a>[693]</span>
cushion. The king is a scholar and a musician; he is devout, moreover,
writes very elaborate Masses in eight parts, and has gone on
pilgrimage to Our Lady of Walsingham, walking barefoot from the
town of Barsham; and Erasmus has gone there too, and has hung
up a copy of verses as his offering at her altar. How artistically he
paints the broad green way across the fields by which the pilgrims
approach, and the little chapel built within the splendid church, in
imitation of the Holy House of Loretto, wherein there is no light
save from the tapers that burn with so delicious an odour, and the
walls of which are blazing with gold and jewels!</p>

<p>Or we are introduced to the “solemn Christmas” kept by the
Court at Richmond or Greenwich, with “revels, disguisings, and
banquets royal, all with great nobleness;” and we observe how the
quaint mummings which found favour at the beginning of the reign
are gradually giving place to “masks, after the manner of Italy, a
thing not seen before in England, with which some were content, but
which others that knew the fashion of it,”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> appear to have disapproved.
Such scenes were well calculated to dazzle and fascinate a young
courtier; but Pole was proof against them; he showed no hurry
either to plunge into the amusements of his age, or to enter on the
brilliant political career which fortune seemed to open before him,
and had hardly appeared at Court before he solicited from the king
a fresh leave of absence.</p>

<p>The six years he had spent at Oxford did not by any means satisfy
his ardour for study, and, with the consent of the king, who had
charged himself with the education of his young kinsman, he proceeded
to Padua, which Erasmus styled the Athens of Europe, and
where students from all countries were eager to resort. Here “the
nobleman of England,” as he was called by the Italians, soon won
golden opinions&mdash;from some, for his singular modesty and virtue,
from others, for the graceful acquirements that so well became his
royal birth; and here he first became introduced to Bembo and
Sadolet, with the latter of whom his acquaintance ripened into friendship.
After the fashion of the times, he received a certain number
of humbler scholars into his household, and among these were Longolius,
who records his dislike for frivolous conversation, and Lupset,
afterwards Greek Professor at Oxford. Erasmus, too, was often a
welcome guest when the wanderings of that restless scholar led him
to Padua, and his voluminous correspondence includes many letters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_694"></a>[694]</span>
to Pole, who, though totally opposed to his views on religious matters,
was yet unable, like the rest of the world, to shut him out of his
affections.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the breach between the reformers and the Church had
terribly widened, and open war was being waged between the two
parties. Henry VIII. had written his “Defence of the Seven Sacraments,”
and Luther had published his “Reply;” the scurrility of
which had called both More and Fisher into the field as controversialists.
But Erasmus still kept silence. He was on excellent terms
with Luther and Melanchthon, the worthy Dr. Jonas, and the other
Coryphæi of the Reform. He corresponded with them all, and
did them every service in his power at the head of those German
Humanists whose literary labours were directed against the old-fashioned
theologians, while their political intrigues aimed at winning
over the young emperor to their side, or at least at procuring
his neutrality. It is true he regretted that Luther should openly
have broken from the Church, and the excesses of the heretics
offered fair mark for his satire; nevertheless with most of their views
of reform he heartily sympathised. On the other hand, as he was
not ashamed of avowing, he had no intention of dying a martyr for
his principles, neither did he at all contemplate offending the
Catholic sovereigns by whom he was petted and pensioned. He
counted on his own address for enabling him to steer a middle
course, to save both his head and his Court remittances, and earn
a good name for moderation. But on this fair horizon clouds were
now about to rise. He received an official hint from Cuthbert
Tonstall that King Henry was surprised and offended at his silence,
and that rumours were even afloat that he had assisted Luther in
the composition of his “Reply.” In vain did Erasmus protest his
innocence; only one course would satisfy the king. Let him write
against Luther, if he wished his sincerity to be believed; the whole
Catholic world expected it of him, and was scandalised at his delay.
But if this did not suit him, he could not be surprised if his pension
from the Court of England were withdrawn. Thus sorely pressed,
Erasmus prepared to obey. But meanwhile, a whisper of what was
going on had reached Luther’s ears, and he wrote at once, advising
his quondam ally to be wise and preserve silence. Luther, at least,
had the merit of being a plain speaker; “If you take up the cudgels
against me,” he says, “you will be beset on both sides, and must
infallibly be worsted. Everybody knows that what you style<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_695"></a>[695]</span>
moderation, is really duplicity. All I ask is, that you will stand
quietly by and see the play, and not take part in it, and then I will
leave you alone; but if not, you know very well what you have to
expect.” This letter by some means became public, and Erasmus
felt that his last chance was gone. If <em>now</em> he held his tongue, he
should be accused of collusion; so, in pure desperation, he plunged
into the combat, and wrote his treatise on Free Will, copies of
which he was careful to send to all the crowned heads of Europe.
Wonderful credit he took to himself for this achievement, declaring
that he had exposed himself to be stoned to death by the heretics,
but that he gloried in suffering for so good a cause. At the same
time his letters to Melanchthon are couched in the most pitiful and
apologetic strain. He could not help himself; he was a lost man
if he had held his peace; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">figuli Romanenses</i> had made the
Catholic sovereigns believe he was a Lutheran; he would have
been ruined if he had refused to write. To Vives he was more
explicit. “I have written a treatise on Free Will,” he says, “but
to confess the truth I lost my own. There my heart dictated one
thing, and my pen wrote another.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> However, whether his attack
were sham or earnest mattered little to Luther; it was a declaration
of war, and as such he treated it, replying to it with his usual promptitude,
and with more than his usual grossness. The other leaders
of the Reform likewise gave tongue on the occasion, and denounced
the unwilling controversialist as a Balaam who had been hired to
curse Israel. Poor Erasmus had reaped the just reward of his
shuffling policy, and felt himself in a sad quandary. He knew not
whether to advance or retreat, and either way he had to wade
through the mire. He pours out his vexation in a letter to Pole; in
which, however, he is careful to keep up the tone of a sufferer for
the faith. “Luther has written a huge volume against me,” he says,
“in a style one would not use in addressing the Turk; and so, from
the partisan of peace and quiet which I would fain remain, I am
forced to turn gladiator, and, what is worse, to fight with wild beasts
in the arena.”</p>

<p>On his return to England, Pole found a sad and ominous cloud
hanging over the Court which he had left so prosperous and splendid.
The question of the divorce had already been mooted, and the
bad success of the negotiations with Rome had brought about the
fall of Wolsey. Henry was anxious to secure the support of Pole,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_696"></a>[696]</span>
whose influence at Rome he foresaw would one day be powerful,
and employed his new favourite, Cromwell, to sound and tempt him.
That worthy minister commenced operations by putting a copy of
Machiavel’s works into the hands of Reginald, who returned it to
him with disgust, and contrived to get leave to retire to Shene, where
he took up his residence in Colet’s old house. Here he remained
for two years, carefully abstaining from taking any part in public
affairs, and at the end of that time asked and obtained leave to
proceed for another term of study to the University of Paris. He
was not long suffered to remain there in peace. The notable scheme
of consulting the European universities and divines, which had
been originally proposed by Wolsey, was warmly taken up by his
successors, and royal agents were now busy in every foreign country,
seeking, by bribes and cajolery, to obtain opinions favourable
to the king’s divorce. To the credit of the English universities it
must be said they opposed a stubborn resistance, and the affirmative
declaration sent to the king never received the votes of the majority.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
But foreign academies were found more pliant; it is true the charge
for a professor’s conscience was somewhat exorbitant, but still they
had their price, and did not refuse to be bargained for. In Germany,
indeed, Luther’s influence was powerful enough to prevent his old
adversary from receiving any assistance, but greater success was met
with in France and Italy, and a commission was now sent to Pole,
requiring him to gather up the suffrages of the Paris professors. He
contrived to evade the odious office thus wilily thrust upon him,
and was sickened to the heart by observing the eagerness with which
the Humanists came forward in this disgraceful business. No one
was a more active agent than Croke, the Greek orator, who wrote
complacently to the king, detailing the success which attended his
“honourable presents” to the Italian professors. Richard Pace, too,
the successor of Colet, and the holder of several diplomatic offices,
writes to say he has found a man ready to put the case <em>either for
or against</em> the divorce, according to his Majesty’s pleasure, so as
all the divines of England shall not be able to reply. The facile
casuist here alluded to was no other than Wakefield, the Hebrew
professor at Oxford; and, in short, turn where we will, we find the
pedagogues busily engaged in doing very dirty work at high wages.</p>

<p>Pole was next recalled to England to be tempted with caresses.
The Archbishopric of York, it was hinted, was at his command, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_697"></a>[697]</span>
he were willing to bend to the king’s wishes. His own family were
employed to move his determination, and at last, beset on all sides,
he wavered, and consented to see the king. Henry received him
graciously in the gallery at Whitehall; but when he tried to speak,
conscience gained the day, and, with a faltering voice, instead of
protesting his readiness to serve his Grace in his “secret matter,” he
plainly declared his conviction that the proposed divorce was utterly
unlawful. Though Henry cut him short with a volley of reproaches,
he treated him with more magnanimity than might have been
expected. He did not order him to the Tower, and silenced the
officious courtiers who expressed their disgust at Reginald’s ingratitude,
by the unexpected declaration that he loved him in spite of his
obstinacy.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> His pension was not withdrawn, and he was suffered
once more to retire abroad; and in 1531 Pole withdrew to Italy,
never again to set foot on the English shores till he landed there a
Papal legate, to reconcile his country, for too brief a space, to the
communion of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue the events of the great tragedy, save
in so far as they affected the career of Pole. In his retreat at
Padua, his heart was torn by the news of each successive step by
which the infatuated king was plunging his country into schism;
the rupture with Rome, the repudiation of Catherine, the marriage
with Anne, and the formal establishment of the royal supremacy.
The English Lords and Commons submitted to all this with wonderful
docility, but to Henry’s vexation he found that his proceedings
were daily losing him the countenance of friends abroad. The
Emperor of course, was his sworn enemy; Francis I. had refused
to listen to the explanations of his ambassadors; Cochlæus, and
other grave writers, had drawn the pen against him; and even
Calvin made game of his new-fangled supremacy, and ridiculed the
man who had delivered his country from the primacy of Peter to
saddle it with the primacy of Henry. Erasmus, too, had withdrawn
from a country where it was no longer safe for a man to have an
opinion. He was just then directing his irony against the Protestants,
who had disgusted him with their grossness, and whom he
pronounces a sad set of hypocrites. “People talk of Lutheranism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_698"></a>[698]</span>
as a tragic business, but for my part I think it is a regular comedy,
and, like other comedies, the piece always ends with a marriage.”
Elsewhere he says, “We have been stunned long enough with the
cry of <em>Gospel, Gospel, Gospel</em>. What we want is Gospel manners.
These Evangelicals love money and pleasure, and despise everything
else.” Henry’s Acts of Parliament, too, seasoned as they were with
axe and fagot, did not suit his notions of moderation; and, besides,
just then Pope Paul III. was making him tempting offers, so that
Erasmus was not at all disposed to take up the gauntlet on behalf
of a prince, against whose conduct all the respectable part of Europe
was protesting. Henry had, therefore, no one to look to out of his
own kingdom save the small German princes and Protestant divines;
and it was a sore humiliation to sue for support to the religionists
whom it was his boast to have defeated in controversy. In this
extremity, his thoughts turned to Pole, who owed him everything,
and who, he could not believe, would ever openly take part against
him. Cuthbert Tonstall, Reginald’s dearest friend, had swallowed
the new oath, and accepted the bishopric of Durham; why should
Reginald’s conscience be more tender? A messenger was, therefore,
posted to Padua, with letters to Pole inviting him to accept the
king’s offers of favour, and write in defence of those royal claims
which had been accepted as law by the English Parliament and
Hierarchy.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Pole saw that the time was come to take his part
openly and decidedly. He sat down and counted the cost, and
then he took pen in hand and wrote, not an apology for the supremacy,
but his celebrated treatise <cite>De Unitate Ecclesiastica</cite> in which
he sums up all the acts by which England has been severed from
Catholic communion, fearlessly condemns the sacrileges of the king,
and calls on him to enter on the path of penance. Whilst thus
engaged, terrible tidings reached him: the axe had fallen at last,
and More and Fisher were numbered with the martyrs; and, with
the tears blotting his paper, he gave vent to his sorrow in that
magnificent apostrophe to the memory of his friends, which he
introduces in his Third Book. The treatise was finished in four
months, and despatched to England by a faithful messenger, who
was charged to deliver it into the king’s own hands; and then, fully
aware of the consequences of his determination, Reginald set out for
Rome, whither he had been invited by Paul III. almost immediately
on his accession. His friends entreated him not openly to break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_699"></a>[699]</span>
with the king by accepting any preferment from the Pope. The two
Houses of Parliament even sent him a common letter to the same
effect; but before it reached him, Pole was at Rome, and had
received from the new Pontiff the dignity of Cardinal.</p>

<p>Two months later he found himself charged with a dangerous
and difficult mission. The fate of Anne Boleyn had, it was hoped,
removed from the king his worst councillor, and the insurrection of
the northern counties of England bore witness that the people themselves
were still true to the faith. Hopes were, therefore, entertained
that negotiations for a reconciliation might now be opened, and
Pole was accordingly appointed legate north of the Alps, with
instructions to proceed to Flanders, to bring about a peace between
France and the Empire, to announce the Pope’s resolve to call a
General Council, and to seize any occasion that might present itself
for confirming the English Catholics in their faith, and negotiating
with the king’s government. The legation, however, was an utter
failure. Henry had proclaimed the Cardinal a traitor, and set a
price on his head; he had offered to buy him of the Emperor in
exchange for a force of four thousand men; he had so managed
matters that the legate was warned to leave France as quickly as
possible, and refused admission into the imperial territory; the
English agents were everywhere busy endeavouring to procure either
his open seizure or his secret assassination; and in the midst of
these multiplied perils Pole had no support save his own great heart
and dauntless courage. His chaplains and followers were perplexed
and terrified. A legate in those days travelled in state, with his
cross borne openly at the head of his train; but the attendant, whose
duty it was to carry the cross, turned faint-hearted, and suggested
the prudence of concealing these marks of dignity in a hostile
country. The last of the Plantagenets, however, was not the man
to quail in the presence of danger; he calmly took the cross from
the hands of the bearer, and fixing its point firmly in his own stirrup,
rode along, thinking perhaps of St. Thomas, and certainly as ready
as he to face the assassins, and shed his life-blood in the cause of
the Church.</p>

<p>A second legation in 1538 proved equally fruitless, and its
only result was the slaughter of every one of Pole’s family on
whom Henry could lay his hands. The Cardinal meanwhile was
recalled to Rome, and appointed to the government of Viterbo,
where he heard, in 1541, of the murder of his aged mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_700"></a>[700]</span>
gave thanks that she, too, had been deemed worthy to suffer for
the faith. His political engagements had not weaned him from the
love of letters, and, amid his many trials, he found his chief solace,
after his exercises of piety, in the company of his learned friends.
Pole entertained very strong views as to the necessity of restoring a
more Christian system of studies, and laboured hard to bring those
around him to the same mind. Sadolet had just published his
“Treatise on Education,” and Pole addressed him a letter which
Erasmus calls worthy of Cicero, touchingly remonstrating with him
for not giving a more prominent place to Christian theology. Sadolet
defends himself by saying that theology is a part of philosophy,
and the perfection of it; but Pole was not satisfied. It might
do well enough, he says, if your pupil lived in the time of Plato
or Aristotle, but a Christian scholar requires something more than
philosophy. Their difference of opinion, however, was expressed
on both sides with equal courtesy and moderation, and the correspondence
between them offers a pleasing contrast to those acrimonious
disputes, in which the scholars of the last generation had
so frequently disgraced themselves.</p>

<p>This was not the only occasion when Pole exerted himself to give
a more decidedly Christian direction to his friend’s studies. Sadolet
had two works on hand; one a treatise in praise of philosophy,
the other a Commentary on St. Paul. He was doubting which to
finish first, and Bembo of course advised the preference to be given
to philosophy. Pole was as great a lover of classical antiquity as
either of them, but at that grievous juncture, when a swarm of
heretics were in the field, it seemed to him a kind of infidelity for
the children of the Church to waste their time and genius on elegant
trifling. His arguments decided Sadolet in favour of St. Paul, and
he afterwards received his friend’s hearty thanks for having thus
determined his choice. “There were not wanting plenty,” writes
Sadolet, “who were ready to give me very different advice, but you
counselled me to embrace studies, the emoluments of which extend
to the other life, and your words have decided me henceforth to
devote myself to sacred literature.”</p>

<p>There was, however, nothing of the narrowness of a zealot in Pole’s
character; he and Contarini were advocates for a mild policy even
with heretics; and his gentle persuasion had a happy success in
recalling many who had been seduced by the new opinions, among
others, the Latin poet Mark Anthony Flaminius. This celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_701"></a>[701]</span>
man had been one of his early friends, but had suffered himself to
be won over by the specious arguments of Valdes. Pole invited
him to Viterbo, and, by dint of patience and kindness, restored him
to a better mind, and it was in his house that he afterwards expired,
as Beccadelli expresses it, “like a good Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> In the same
spirit he received into his family Lazarus Bonamico, professor of
humanity at Padua, saying that he was worth something better than
the occupation of explaining Virgil, and that the study of theology
which he wished him to embrace, required the whole man. He
assisted Bembo also in his last moments, and his house was the
refuge of all those English Catholics, who, like himself, preferred
exile to apostasy.</p>

<p>Among these, one is glad to reckon George, the son of our old
friend William Lily, <ins class="corr" id="tn701" title="Transcriber’s Note—“whom he took under his plotection” changed to “whom he took under his protection”.">whom he took under his protection</ins>, and who,
alter writing some learned works, and contributing to the history of
Paulus Jovius, returned with Pole to England in Queen Mary’s days,
and died a prebendary of Canterbury. And so we will leave our
great countryman for a time doing the work of an apostle among
the scholars of his day, to find him again at the head of that
momentous council, which owed to his influence not a few of its
most important measures of reform. Before following him there,
we have to take our farewell of the English schools, whose destinies
from this time form a page in the history of sacrilege. The first
royal visitation of the universities, held in virtue of King Henry’s
newly-claimed supremacy, took place in 1535, when the further
study of scholastic philosophy and canon law were prohibited. For
a brief space the attempt was made to fill up the hiatus with an extra
quantity of Greek and profane studies, and then it was that Sir John
Cheke achieved that celebrity at Cambridge which Milton has
commemorated in a sonnet. All the Humanists indeed were not
men of equally solid learning, for Saunders tells us the universities
were filled with a multitude of young orators and poets, who, after
celebrating the mock obsequies of Scotus and St. Thomas, tried, by
means of unbecoming comedies, songs, and verses, to decoy the
unwary into the errors of the sects, and immorality of life. On the
whole, the attempt was a failure; English scholars were nor yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_702"></a>[702]</span>
sufficiently familiarised with the new learning to give it a very warm
reception, and the exotic Greek studies, like plants that had been
overforced, soon drooped and perished.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Canon law and theology,
and, above all, the despised scholastic logic, were precisely the studies
in which Catholic Oxford had most excelled; and their abolition
was tantamount to the formal closing of her schools. And during
the reign of Edward VI. the divinity school was actually closed, and
in spite of every effort on the part of the Humanists, the decay
became so universal that all the other schools, except two, were shut
up, or let out to laundresses and glovers. “There, where Minerva
formerly sat as regent,” says Wood, “was nothing during all the
reign of King Edward but wretched solitariness; nothing but a
dead silence prevailed.” The dissolution of the monasteries, moreover,
had ruined upwards of a hundred flourishing academies, which
served as feeders to the universities, the place of which was very
imperfectly filled by King Edward’s grammar-schools. Thus, a
large proportion of those who had formerly followed the pursuit of
learning, now betook themselves to mechanical trades, and the
schools literally died out for want of scholars. In 1550 we find
Roger Ascham, a strenuous adherent of the new worship, lamenting
over the decay of the old grammar-schools, and predicting in
consequence the speedy extinction of the universities: whilst
Latimer about the same time is found declaring that there were at
least ten thousand fewer students in the kingdom than might have
been found twenty years previously.</p>

<p>The ruin of learning at the universities was completed by the
bigotry of those foreign Protestant divines, who, in King Edward’s
time, were brought over from Germany and Switzerland to fill up
the professorships which no English scholar could be found to
accept under the new ecclesiastical régime. Among these the
celebrated Peter Vermigli, better known by the name of Peter
Martyr, was indeed a good scholar, but the greater number of his
colleagues were not only without learning, but, following in the
footsteps of Luther, they proclaimed war against it as “a human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_703"></a>[703]</span>
thing.” They voted the academical degrees “Antichristian,” and
showed their horror of all the vain things fondly invented by Popery,
not only by the breaking of images, but by the burning of libraries.
Duke Humphrey’s precious collection of classical authors was condemned
to the flames; the exquisite illuminations of his costly
volumes possibly suggesting the notion that they must be of the
nature of Roman service books. When Sir Thomas Bodley took
up his residence at Oxford, towards the end of Elizabeth’s reign, he
informs us that he found the libraries “in every part wasted and
ruined,” and it is well known that the splendid foundation which we
owe to his munificence, was but a collection of such poor fragments
as had accidentally escaped destruction.</p>

<p>Of the material sacrileges committed by King Edward’s visitors
it is unnecessary here to speak, and without necessity one would
not willingly enter on the sorrowful tale. The shell of the universities
was left, to be gradually informed with a new spirit, a new
learning, a new life; which, as years rolled on, became no longer
new, and so gradually grew to be regarded by Englishmen as
venerable. Oxford, with her thousand Catholic memories, became
in process of time the stronghold of Anglican Church Toryism; a
pigmy destiny, indeed, for her who had been founded by the hands
of saints, yet one with which, on the whole, she has showed herself
amply satisfied. The Royal Supremacy, which had first cut down
her fair proportions, clung to her like the poisoned garment of Nessus,
but though it sometimes galled her, she made the most (as was
fitting) of her solitary dogma, and, in a memorable moment of her
history, proclaimed fidelity to it in its extremest form to be “the
badge of the Church of England.”</p>

<p>Here, then, we will bid farewell to Oxford; to those venerable
walls round which there still hang shadows of the past, out of which
alas! too many build up an unsubstantial cloudland, with the
gorgeous beauty of which they rest content. The Catholic, while
he feels the power which even such phantoms of the old faith
exercise over the heart, knows well enough that he does but gaze on</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"><em>CHAPTER XXIV.</em></h2>
<p class="pfs90">THE COUNCIL OF TRENT.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the conclave of October 13, 1534, announced the election of
Cardinal Alexander Farnese as successor to Clement VII., few men
probably anticipated what would be the character of the new pontificate.
The antecedents of Paul III. appeared to link him with
what may be called the Conservative party of the day. He had
been a pupil of Pomponius Lætus, had been raised to the purple by
Alexander VI., had grown up in the luxurious atmosphere of Leo’s
Court, and in his early youth, before he embraced the ecclesiastical
state, had not escaped the worldly infection which clung to the
literary circles among which he mixed. Men of letters indeed
might naturally look for encouragement from the friend of Sadolet,
the correspondent of Erasmus, and the elegant commentator on
Cicero, but few expected to find in him the uncompromising
champion of ecclesiastical reform. Yet such he soon proved himself.
One fault alone was charged to his administration, the promotion
of relatives whose subsequent misconduct brought scandal
on the Church, and anguish to his own heart. But in other respects
his favour was bestowed on precisely those who were best qualified
to forward the interests of religion. He filled the sacred college
with men worthy of the purple; Pole, Fisher, Caraffa, Contarini,
Sadolet, Aleander, and Cortese, were all cardinals of his nomination.
In his love of art and poetry he was hardly inferior to Leo X., but
the thoughts that occupied his soul as Supreme Head of the Church
had a higher and nobler aim than even the encouragement of letters.
To restore peace between France and the Empire, to keep back the
onward progress of the Turks, and to call a General Council for the
purpose of healing the wounds of the Church, these were the objects
he set before him as the work of his pontificate, and he never rested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_705"></a>[705]</span>
till he had accomplished them. Until Charles and Francis had
laid down their arms, however, the Council so loudly demanded by
men of all opinions was a simple impossibility, and ten weary years
had to pass before these Christian princes could be brought to terms.
If for a moment they suspended hostilities, it was only to renew
them with greater animosity than before, and to give the French
king an opportunity of covering himself with infamy by calling to
his help the Turkish hordes, and inviting them to overrun Italy.
Whilst Europe was involved in these broils, it was plain there could
be no Council; but at least there could be the initiatives of reform,
and in 1537 Paul III. proved his earnest desire to begin the work
by naming a Commission of cardinals and other ecclesiastics, whom
he charged with the delicate task of drawing up a statement of those
abuses which, in their judgment, most loudly called for redress.</p>

<p>This Commission was composed of nine men, whose names were
equally illustrious for integrity and learning. They were the cardinals
Contarini, Caraffa, Sadolet, and Pole, together with five other
prelates afterwards raised to the same dignity; namely, Fregoso,
Archbishop of Salerno; Aleander, Archbishop of Brindisi; Ghiberti,
Bishop of Verona; Gregory Cortese, Abbot of Lerins; and Father
Thomas Badia, Master of the Sacred Palace.</p>

<p>Some of these have already been spoken of. Contarini and
Aleander had distinguished themselves by their missions in Germany
and their fruitless efforts to conciliate and win back the misguided
Lutherans. Ghiberti had been associated with Pole in his legations,
and was bound to him by close ties of friendship. He was regarded
by St. Charles Borromeo as the ideal of a Christian bishop, and his
portrait always hung in the saint’s chamber, to urge him, as he said,
to imitate his pastoral career. He was also profoundly learned,
and had set up a printing-press in his episcopal palace, whence
issued forth magnificent editions of the Greek Fathers. Cortese, a
Benedictine abbot, had revived the fame of the old monastery of
Lerins, and restored regular observance in a great number of other
houses of his order. Tiraboschi calls him one of the most elegant
writers of his age, and says that his theological works are free from
the least tincture of scholastic barbarism. Frederic Fregoso was a
Hebrew scholar, and Aleander a learned Orientalist. Not one, in
short, of all the nine could be taunted as a disciple of the retrograde
school, and all had in one way or other taken part in the revival of
polite letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_706"></a>[706]</span></p>

<p>Out of the twenty-seven heads to which they reduced their statement
of existing abuses, one only concerns our present subject.
The whole report was indeed of great importance, and furnished
the basis on which were framed many of the decrees of discipline
subsequently promulgated by the Fathers of Trent. But it is the
sixteenth article alone which touches on the subject of university
education, which we will here reproduce as containing both a brief
summary and a sufficient justification of much that has been put
forward in the foregoing pages. After noticing the reforms urgently
called for in the collation to ecclesiastical benefices, the Congregation
of prelates proceed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is a great and pernicious abuse that in the public schools,
especially of Italy, many philosophers teach impiety. Even in the
churches most impious disputations are held, and if some are of
a pious nature, yet in them sacred things are treated before the
people in a most irreverent manner. We think, therefore, that it
should be pointed out to the bishops, in those places where public
schools exist, that they admonish those who deliver lectures not to
teach impiety to the young, but to manifest to them the weakness
of natural reason in questions appertaining to God, to the recent
origin or eternity of the world, and the like, and that they rather
lead them to piety. Also, that they permit not public disputations
to be held on questions of this nature, nor even on theological subjects,
which certainly in this way lose much in vulgar esteem; but let
disputations be held in private on these matters, and let the public
disputations be on other questions of physics. And the same thing
ought to be enjoined on all other bishops, specially of great cities
where disputations of this sort are wont to be held. And the same
care should be employed about the printing of books, and all princes
should be written to, warning them not to allow books of all sorts
to be printed everywhere in their dominions. And the care of the
matter should be committed to the ordinaries. And whereas it is
now customary to read to boys in the schools the ‘Colloquies’ of
Erasmus,<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> in which there are many things which instil impiety into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_707"></a>[707]</span>
inexperienced minds, the reading of this book, and of others of a
similar character, ought to be prohibited.”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>This certainly is a most remarkable document. It proceeded
not from a body of “Scotists” and “barbarians,” but from elegant
Humanists, all of them university scholars, whilst some, like
Aleander, had themselves occupied Professors’ chairs. It will be
observed that the evils which they point out in the existing system
of education, and which they indicate as lying at the root of so many
prevailing corruptions, are precisely those the growth of which we
have been watching from the time when the universities replaced
the episcopal and monastic schools. The whole weakness of the
Professorial system is here laid bare; its incitements to vanity, its
tendency to substitute novelties that tickle the ears of a mixed
audience for the teaching of solid truth; the system which had
Berengarius and Abelard for its fittest representatives; which had
already produced a goodly crop of heretics and false teachers, and
which, while it extinguished the old ecclesiastical seminaries,
supplied in place of them, nothing better for the training of the
Christian priesthood, than universities which, in Italy, at least, had
grown to be little else than academies of heathen philosophy. Such
a grave and deliberate declaration, and from such authority,
requires no commentary; it was a candid avowal from the choicest
intellects of Christendom, that three centuries before, a false step
had been taken; and a plain and solemn warning that if the evil
results of that step were now to be remedied, it could only be by
returning to the ancient paths.</p>

<p>It was precisely at this time that St. Ignatius and his companions
first appeared in Rome, and submitted to the Holy See the plan for
the foundation of their society. The education of youth<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> is set
forth in the Formula of Approval granted by Paul III. in 1540 as
the first duty embraced by the new Institute, and it is to be
observed that the two patrons who most powerfully interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_708"></a>[708]</span>
themselves in obtaining this approval were both of them members
of the above-named commission, namely, Cardinal Gaspar Contarini,
and the Dominican, Father Thomas Badia. Although the new
religious were not at once able to begin the establishment of
colleges, yet the plan of those afterwards founded was gradually
ripening in the sagacious mind of St. Ignatius, who looked to these
institutions as calculated to oppose the surest bulwarks against the
progress of heresy. The first regular college of the Society was that
established at Gandia in 1546, through the zeal of St. Francis
Borgia, third General of the Society; and the regulations by which
it was governed, and which were embodied in the constitutions,
were extended to all the Jesuit colleges afterwards founded. The
studies were to include theology, both positive and scholastic, as
well as grammar, poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy. The course of
philosophy was to last three years, that of theology four; and the
Professors of Philosophy were enjoined to treat their subject in such
a way as to dispose the mind for the study of theology, instead of
setting up faith and reason in opposition to one another. The
theology of St. Thomas, and the philosophy of Aristotle, were to be
followed, except on those points where the teaching of the latter
was opposed to the Catholic faith. Those points of metaphysics
which involved questions depending for their demonstration on
revealed truth, such as free-will, or the origin of evil, were not to be
treated in the course of philosophy, but to be reserved for that of
theology. No classical authors, whether Greek or Latin, wherein
was to be found anything contrary to good morals, were to be read
in the classes until first corrected, and the students were subjected
to rules of discipline which aimed at forming in them habits of
solid piety. It is clear that colleges thus constituted were exactly
fitted to carry out those reforms which Pole and his colleagues had
suggested as being so urgently called for, and that the system of
education thus proposed effectually excluded the “impious philosophy”
which had been nurtured in the academies of Italy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the political horizon was gradually growing clearer,
and on the 13th of December 1545, the first session of the long-expected
Council was opened by the three legates nominated by
the Pope. They were the Cardinals del Monte, Cervini, and Pole.
The two first successively filled the chair of St. Peter after Paul III.,
under the titles of Julius III. and Marcellus II. Pole held his
office only until the October of the following year, when the state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_709"></a>[709]</span>
of his health obliged him to retire from the legation. He nevertheless
continued to be employed in affairs connected with the
Council, and assisted in drawing up the Bull of Reform published
by Julius III. in 1550. The exhortation addressed to the Fathers
of the Council at the opening of the second session was composed
by him, and the doctrinal decree on Justification, which defined the
faith of the Church on the point most warmly controverted by the
Lutherans, is believed to have been first sketched out by his pen,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
and was certainly submitted by his colleagues to his approval in its
complete shape before publication, he being then detained by sickness
at Padua. In 1554 the accession of Queen Mary recalled him
to England, where, for the four remaining years of his life, he was
engaged in reconstructing the shattered constitution of the English
Church, and was, of course, unable to take any active part in the
affairs of the Council. But some of his Synodal Acts anticipated
in so remarkable a manner the Tridentine decrees of discipline that
they have been even supposed to have furnished the model on
which the decrees were drawn up. At any rate, they evince how
thoroughly Pole was himself imbued with the views and principles
which guided the Fathers of the Council, and bear too closely on
our subject to be omitted here.</p>

<p>The first act of his primacy, after the formal reconciliation of the
nation to the Holy See, was to summon a Provincial Synod, which
met in Henry VII.’s Chapel in Westminster Abbey, and continued
to sit from the November of 1554 to the same month in the ensuing
year. After regulations passed for the remedy of sundry abuses,
such as pluralities and non-residence, and others which aimed at
providing for the instruction of the people, by means of preaching,
we come to the important decrees on the subject of Church seminaries.
A return was made to the ancient ecclesiastical system, and
the cathedral schools were put on a footing which should enable them
to train the future clergy of the diocese. Every cathedral was to
maintain, in its own school, a certain number of boys, in proportion
to its revenues. Those only were to be chosen in whom there
seemed to be tokens of a vocation to the priesthood; they were to
be received about the age of eleven or twelve, rather from the ranks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_710"></a>[710]</span>
of the poor than the rich, and were required before admission to
know at least how to read and write. All were to wear the tonsure
and the ecclesiastical habit, to live in common, and to assist daily
at the public office in the cathedral. They were gradually to be
admitted to Holy Orders, at proper intervals. The school was to be
placed under the superintendence of the Dean and Chapter. Other
students might be admitted, who were required to follow the rules
of the seminary in all things. Moreover, all the schools and schoolmasters
of the diocese were placed under the jurisdiction of the
Ordinary, and the books used in these schools were first to be approved
by him.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The acts of this synod were sent to Rome, and
formally approved by Pope Paul IV., and there is little doubt that
they must have been in the hands of many of the prelates who
assisted at the later sessions of the Council of Trent.</p>

<p>The next task which presented itself was the restoration of the
universities, which, as we have seen, had sunk during the reign of
Edward VI., into a state of utter decay. Here the Cardinal’s efforts
were nobly seconded by Queen Mary, who re-endowed the Colleges
with such portions of their revenues as had been seized by the Crown,
and at her own charges commenced the rebuilding of the schools.
To restore the ancient theological studies, and place the universities
on their former footing, Nicholas Ormanetti, formerly Vicar-General
to the good prelate Matthew Ghiberti, and now first Datary to the
English Legation, was appointed visitor. The heretical professors
were replaced with learned Catholics, both native and foreign, and
among the latter number were the two Spanish Dominicans, Peter
Soto and Bartholomew Carranza, both of whom had been present as
theologians at some of the sittings of the Council of Trent. By their
influence the scholastic theology was restored at Oxford&mdash;a circumstance
which occasioned the charge of <em>obscurantism</em> to be very unsuitably
brought against the Catholic professors, by those who had been
engaged before them in crying down humane learning and burning
Duke Humphrey’s library. Pole certainly was not one to neglect the
cultivation of humane literature, but the restoration of the Divinity
schools of Oxford was just then of more urgent necessity than anything
else, and we could not have blamed the Catholic prelates if, in
their solicitude on this point, they had even allowed the polite letters
to remain for a time uncared for. They did, however, the very reverse
of this, and put such renewed life into the English schools as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_711"></a>[711]</span>
inspired Sir Thomas Pope with courage to propose a new Oxford
foundation, for the express purpose of promoting classical studies.
The statutes of Trinity College, Oxford, were submitted to the approval
of Pole, who pleaded strongly for more Greek. Sir Thomas
Pope is represented by some to have resisted this, but his own letters
explain the true state of the case. “I like the purpose well,” he says,
“but I fear the times will not bear it now. I remember when I was
a young scholar at Eton the Greek tongue was growing apace, but
the study of it of late is much decayed.” That is to say, that the
real “obscurantism” had been occasioned, not by the Spanish
Dominicans, but by the Genevese Reformers, who left it to Pole and
his colleagues to undo their mischievous work. In consequence of
the Cardinal’s representations, a Greek lecturer was appointed at
Trinity, and the buildings of old Durham College were given up to
the new foundation, the present library being the very same originally
built to receive the books deposited there by Richard of Bury.</p>

<p>The death of the queen in 1558, followed sixteen hours later by
that of the Cardinal Primate, put an end to the work of restoration,
and the curtain dropped heavily over the hopes of the English
Catholics. And in what way, it may be asked, did the triumph of
Protestantism affect the schools? “Duns, and his rabble of barbarous
questionists” (to use the language of Ascham) were, of course,
put to the rout; but what was substituted in their place during the
golden reign of Queen Elizabeth? Five years after her accession,
we learn from Wood, that there were only three divines in Oxford
judged capable of preaching the university sermon. The established
clergy were recruited from an illiterate class, who preached on
Sundays, and worked at their trades on week days, some of them
being hardly able to sign their names. Four years later, when
Archbishop Parker founded three scholarships in Cambridge, for the
best and ablest scholars to be elected from the chief schools of Kent
and Norfolk, it was found prudent to require no higher attainments
from the candidates than a knowledge of grammar, “and, if it may
be, that they should be able to make a verse.” And three years
later again, we find Horne, bishop of Winchester, requiring his
minor canons every week to get by heart a chapter of St. Paul’s
Epistles in Latin, which task they had to repeat aloud at the public
episcopal visitation. The universities revived in some degree towards
the close of Elizabeth’s reign, and yet more under the early Stuart
princes, though it is remarkable how large a number of the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_712"></a>[712]</span>
English scholars of this period, such as Campion and Crashaw,
embraced the Catholic faith. But the free intercommunion with the
mind of Europe, which had been the great intellectual advantage of
these institutions in Catholic times, was now at an end. Whatever
scholarship they fostered was henceforth stamped with a certain
character of narrow nationality; their very Latinity became Anglicised
in its pronunciation, and thus the Latin language ceased
to be to English scholars what it was, and still is, to those of
Catholic academies&mdash;a medium of intercourse between educated
men. Among those Englishmen who have distinguished themselves
in the ranks of science and literature since the Reformation,
a very large proportion have not been university scholars, and our
two philosophers of greatest note, Bacon and Locke, so far from
acknowledging any obligations to their university training, avowedly
despised, and set themselves to make others despise, the academic
system of education.</p>

<p>It remains for us to speak of the decrees affecting the question of
ecclesiastical education passed in the later sessions of the Council of
Trent. The wars and political intrigues of that troublous time
caused so many interruptions in the sittings of the Council that they
were not finally closed until eighteen years from the date of their first
opening.</p>

<p>Few, comparatively, of those who had taken part in the first
sessions, assisted at the three last held in the year 1563, under the
presidency of five cardinal legates.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Of the three who had presided
at the opening of the Council, two had been successively raised to
the Chair of St. Peter, and all had passed to a better life. Not one
survived of those nine Cardinals who had sat in Paul III.’s Congregation
of Reform. But the new generation which had arisen in their
place were animated with the same spirit, or, if there were any difference
to be noticed, it lay, perhaps, in the fact, that the deliberations
of those eighteen years had supplied them with fuller light, and
deepened their desire for the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline.
The very troubles of the times had co-operated in the development
of a strong Christian reaction against the Paganism of the last half
century; and many prelates had not waited for the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_713"></a>[713]</span>
Council before instituting a vigorous reform of abuses in their own
dioceses. Thus the church of Verona under Matthew Ghiberti had
become a model of discipline, and in Portugal the celebrated
Bartholomew of the Martyrs, Archbishop of Braga, had set the
example of exact observance of the canons, in the government of
his large diocese. Among the other means he had adopted for the
reform of his clergy, was the establishment of a sort of seminary in
his own palace, which he endowed out of his episcopal revenues,
appointing as scholasticus a religious of his order. The archbishop
sat in the later sessions of the Council, and took a very prominent
part in its deliberations. Again, the establishment of the Jesuit
colleges, specially the German college in Rome, and the extraordinary
success which had attended the labours of the Blessed
Peter Canisius, in restoring Catholicism in Germany, had poured a
flood of light on the whole subject of educational reform. Canisius
assisted at the sittings of the Council in 1547 and again in 1562,
and even when absent his opinion was continually consulted by
Cardinal Hosius and the other legates. Reform was now not a
theory, but a fact. In Aichstadt, the old diocese of St. Wilibald,
where heresy and irreligion, had, as it seemed, firmly established
themselves, the university was purged of the evil leaven, and the
faith had revived in all its fervour. In Vienna, in spite of the protection
of the Government, religion had so rapidly declined under
the infection of the Lutheran doctrines, that for twenty years not a
single candidate for holy orders had presented himself. Parishes
were left without pastors, the sacraments were neglected, and
through timidity and human respect the Catholic clergy opposed
but a faint resistance to the encroachments of the heretics. But
under the direction of Canisius the university was restored, a
college was founded for the education of youth, and public catechisms
were instituted, which effected a change little short of
miraculous, and the same scenes were to be witnessed in the other
cities of Germany.</p>

<p>The Fathers, therefore, who assembled at the twenty-seventh
session of the Council of Trent had facts as well as principles before
them, indicating a sound system of ecclesiastical education as the
measure best calculated to remedy the evils which afflicted the
Church. In earlier sessions the old canons had been confirmed
requiring cathedrals to maintain a theologian and grammar-master
for the instruction of the younger clergy, but this law fell very far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_714"></a>[714]</span>
short of what was needed, and its frequent renewal by former
Councils does not appear to have been attended with much result.
What the Church had possessed in former ages, and what she now
desired to restore, were not mere theological classes, but rather
nurseries, in which her clergy could be trained in ecclesiastical discipline
as well as supplied with the learning proper to their state.
Such seminaries had existed before the rise of the universities; they
were now to reappear, and it was with unanimous consent, accompanied
with an emotion of grateful joy not easy to express, that the
Fathers passed that decree which has been called the practical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> of the whole Council. It forms the eighteenth chapter
of the twenty-seventh session, and its provisions are briefly as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Every cathedral or metropolitan church is bound, according to its
means, to maintain a certain number of youths belonging to the city
or diocese in some suitable college, who shall then be trained for
the ecclesiastical state. They are to be at least twelve years old,
and chosen from those who give hopes of their being eventually fit
for the priesthood. The Holy Council desires that a “preference
be given to the children of poor parents,” though the rich are not to
be excluded. The college, which is to be “a perpetual seminary
for the service of God,” is entirely under the direction of the bishop,
who is to be assisted by two canons chosen by himself. The
students, on their entrance, are to wear the tonsure and ecclesiastical
habit; to learn grammar, church music, the ecclesiastical
computation, and the other liberal arts; but they are specially to
apply themselves to the study of the Scriptures, and all that appertains
to the right administration of the Sacraments. The bishop, or
the visitors whom he appoints, are to watch over the maintenance of
good discipline among them, and to take all proper means for the
encouragement of piety and virtue. The seminary is to be maintained
by a tax on all the benefices in the diocese. If in any province
the dioceses are too poor each to maintain its own seminary,
the Provincial synod may establish one attached to the metropolitan
church for the general use of all churches of the diocese; or, again,
if a diocese be very large and populous, the bishop may, if necessary,
establish in it more than one seminary. It belongs to the
bishop to appoint or remove the scholasticus, and no person is to be
appointed who is not a doctor or licentiate in theology or canon
law. The bishop also has the right of prescribing what studies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_715"></a>[715]</span>
are to be pursued by the seminarists, according as he may think
proper.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>So universal was the satisfaction caused by this decree, that many
prelates hesitated not to declare, that if no other good were to
result from the labours of the Council, this alone would compensate
to them for all their fatigues and sacrifices. They regarded such
a reform as was here provided, as the only efficacious means of
restoring ecclesiastical discipline, well knowing that in every state
and government, as are the heads, so are the members, and that the
character of a people depends on that of their teachers.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that in this famous decree there is no allusion
to the universities as in any way regarded as nurseries of the clergy.
Canons for their reform were passed in the twenty-fifth session,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> but
not a word was said connecting them in any way with the proposed
seminaries. It is not even recommended that seminaries should
be established in the vicinity of universities where these already
existed, though at that time universities were far more numerous
than now, every province almost possessing one in its territory; but
it is distinctly laid down, that they are to form a part of the cathedral
establishment, and, where it can conveniently be done, that
they be erected in the cathedral city of the diocese. The radical
idea of the seminary is that of its being <em>the bishop’s school</em>,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> formed
under his eye, and subject to his control&mdash;an idea which is manifestly
totally inconsistent with the plan of a university. So strictly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_716"></a>[716]</span>
is this the case, that where colleges have since been founded (as
at Rome) for ecclesiastical students of different nations, which of
course could not be placed under the jurisdiction of their own
bishops, these colleges are rarely given the name of seminaries, the
nature of such institutions, properly so-called, requiring them to be
subject to the canonical authority of their own Ordinary. Universities
were not abolished or condemned, or even discountenanced,
by the Fathers of Trent: they were reformed, indeed, and laws
were passed requiring all masters and doctors to engage by oath, at
the beginning of each year, to explain the Catholic faith according
to the canons of the Council, and obliging visitors to institute the
necessary corrections of discipline. But universities, when doing
their own proper work, continued to receive the same encouragement
as before; and even in our own time, we have witnessed new
ones established, at the express recommendation of the Sovereign
Pontiff, to the end that the Catholic youth of Belgium and Ireland
might enjoy the same advantages for following a course of liberal
studies as were at the command of the uncatholic world around
them.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But other schools than those of the world were to be provided
for those who were to minister divine things, that they might
be “<em>wholly in them</em>, and that their profiting might be manifest to
all.”<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Them the world was not to touch; the smell of the fire was
not to pass on them; from childhood they were to be taken out of
it, and fashioned after another model, signed and set apart as “holy
to the Lord.” Their consecration was not to be the change of a
moment, but the formation of a life; and for ever they were to be
preserved from what even the heathen poet bewailed as “the intolerable
calamity of yielding to what is base,” and to enjoy that which
he declares should be the object of all men’s prayers,&mdash;to dwell in
those sacred temples where “nature and the law of the place should
both conspire to present us in innocence to the Deity.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>Besides the important decrees already referred to, the reform of
education was encouraged by other provisions of the Council of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_717"></a>[717]</span>
Trent, in which we recognise the same solicitude for restoring the
Christian spirit, and abolishing the corrupt Paganism which had
crept into its place. The Tridentine Fathers had something to say
on the matter of art. The object of pictures and images, is, they
remind us, to instruct the people, and recall to them the mysteries
of the Faith; therefore everything profane and indecorous is to be
avoided in the House of God, and the beauty that is represented
must be that alone which savours of holiness. Nor was it to be
supposed that they could be silent on the subject of that ecclesiastical
chant, which from the very infancy of the Christian schools
had taken its place by the side of grammar. The Gregorian chant
had by this time all but disappeared in the greater number of
churches, and had been replaced by orchestral music of the most
profane and unsuitable description. Against this abuse, which had
been growing for upwards of two centuries, Popes and Councils had
uniformly protested, but with little fruit. The Fathers of Trent
seriously contemplated prohibiting the use of instrumental music
altogether, but at the earnest representations of the Emperor Ferdinand,
they contented themselves with prescribing the abuses introduced
by the musical professors,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and making the study of the
plain-song of the Church one of the indispensable studies of the new
seminaries. They number among the duties of those promoted to
cathedral canonries that they should “reverently, distinctly, and
devoutly praise the name of God in hymns and canticles in the
choir appointed for psalmody;” and require the Provincial synods
to regulate the proper way of singing and chanting the divine office.
And the various Provincial councils and synods held to promulgate
the Tridentine decrees, failed not to enforce the same salutary provisions,
as that of Toledo, in 1566, which forbade those noisy exhibitions
wherein the sense of the words is buried under the confusion
of voices.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>The projected reforms had been very warmly urged on the Fathers
by St. Charles Borromeo in his letters from Rome. The friend of
Pole and of St Ignatius, he had watched with lively interest the
success of the German college, and in his twenty-third year had
already put his hand to the work of educational reform, by giving up
the Borromeo palace at Pavia, for the purpose of a college which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_718"></a>[718]</span>
founded out of his own revenues. When in the July of 1563, therefore,
letters from Trent arrived in Rome notifying to the Holy Father
the decree which had been passed, and soliciting his confirmation of
the same, St. Charles earnestly supported the petition of the Legates,
and had the happiness of conveying to them the warm approval of
his Holiness, and his promise that the confirmation should be published
with the least possible delay, and that he himself would be
the first to carry it into execution. Accordingly, on the 18th of
August following he convoked the Cardinals to deliberate with them
on the subject. The foundation of seminaries in all the dioceses of
the Roman State was at once determined on; 6000 scudi were
assigned for the purpose by the Pope, and a Commission of Cardinals,
of whom St. Charles was one, was appointed to carry the resolution
into effect.</p>

<p>Thanks to the exertions of St. Charles, the solemn confirmation
of the Canons of Trent was not long delayed. In a consistory
held on the 30th of December, Pius IV, addressed a moving discourse
to the assembled Cardinals, including several who had recently
returned from the Council, in which, while declaring his firm resolve
to enforce every one of the reforms which had been therein recommended,
he took special notice of the decree on seminaries, which
he praised as having been suggested by the “special inspiration of
God,”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> declaring again that he desired to be the first who should put
his hand to so blessed a work. The confirmation of the Tridentine
Canons followed on the 26th of January 1564, and on the 15th of
April the same year, in a consistory which met in the Hall of Constantine,
plans were proposed for the foundation of the Roman
Seminary, the care of which was committed to the Fathers of the
Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>Nor was it at Rome alone that the decree of the Council was thus
eagerly and promptly carried out. The first act of Bartholomew of
the Martyrs, on returning to his diocese, was to institute measures
for the establishment of a seminary, in precise conformity to the prescribed
canons. He accordingly summoned his chapter and laid
before them the urgency of the business; giving them a noble
example by his own munificent contribution to the necessary expenses.
As it was an undertaking involving a question of finances,
there were not wanting those who murmured at the idea of a compulsory
taxation, but the prudence and moderation of the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_719"></a>[719]</span>
prevailed over every difficulty, and at the end of six months he had
the satisfaction of seeing accommodation provided for sixty students,
and of opening the first seminary founded in Portugal. This appears
to have been in the year 1565. In the same year Daniel, the worthy
successor of St. Boniface in the See of Mentz, commenced the foundation
of the first episcopal seminary of Germany, which he appropriately
dedicated to our great English apostle, and placed under the
direction of the Jesuits. The Provincial Councils, held at Salzburg
and Toledo in 1569, decreed the establishment of provincial seminaries,
and, not to multiply examples, we have but to turn to the
correspondence of St. Pius V. to see how rapidly this great work was
taken up throughout every part of Christendom, and how energetically
it was encouraged by the Sovereign Pontiff himself.</p>

<p>One Saint, however, and one diocese, stands out pre-eminent in
the history of Church seminaries. St. Charles Borromeo had protected
the design in its infancy, and he lived to give the Church a
perfect model of its practical realisation. Appointed to the archbishopric
of Milan when only in his twenty-second year, St. Charles
found it impossible for several years to obtain leave from Pope Pius
IV. to withdraw from Rome and devote himself to his pastoral cares.
Nevertheless, he never ceased to occupy himself with plans for its
benefit, and sought the counsel of every one whom he deemed best
able to instruct him in the duties of government. One of the friends
whose advice he most highly esteemed was Bartholomew of the
Martyrs; another was one whose name, if less famous than that of
the great Archbishop of Braga, has a peculiar interest to the English
reader&mdash;it was the good priest, Nicholas Ormanetti. This saintly
ecclesiastic had acted as Vicar-General to Matthew Ghiberti, and
assisted in the reforms which that zealous prelate had instituted in
his diocese. He had afterwards been appointed first Datary under
Cardinal Pole to the English Legation, and as we have seen, had
been named by him visitor of the English universities. He continued
to act as confidential adviser to our last Archbishop of
Canterbury up to the time of his death, when he left England and
attended several sessions of the Council of Trent.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> After this he
retired to a humble country parish in the diocese of Verona, where
he busied himself with his parochial duties as quietly and happily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_720"></a>[720]</span>
as if he had never exercised a more weighty charge. From this
obscurity he was drawn by St. Charles, who conjured Navagerio, now
Bishop of Verona, to send Ormanetti to him at Rome, that he might
enjoy the benefit of his counsels. He received the humble Curé
with extraordinary respect, and for weeks, to the amazement of the
Roman courtiers, he was closeted day after day with a man whom
nobody knew, and nobody thought worth knowing, and whose
exterior was altogether poor and unpretending. In these long conferences
every point of pastoral discipline was gravely and deliberately
discussed, and the whole plan of the future government of
Milan moulded, as it were, into shape. St. Charles listened eagerly
to the account which Ormanetti gave of the views and methods of
government which had been adopted by the two men whose example
and maxims he most venerated, Ghiberti and Reginald Pole. They
consulted together on the fittest method of executing the Tridentine
decrees, and specially on the formation of seminaries, and the holding
of diocesan synods. And these measures being thus concerted,
Ormanetti was despatched to Milan to discharge the office of Vicar-General
until St. Charles should himself be able to assume the
government of his diocese. Poor Ormanetti, however, found his new
dignity beset with thorns, and the contradictions he had to endure
from the clergy who would not endure the name of reform, moved
St. Charles to make such renewed entreaties that he might repair
himself to his diocese, that he at last obtained from the Pope the
desired permission, and set out for Milan in 1565, where he almost
immediately held his first Provincial Synod. He commenced the
visitation of his diocese in the following year, and in spite of the
overwhelming labour which was thus imposed on him, found time to
begin a series of educational establishments such as never before, we
may confidently affirm, owed their existence to any single founder.
“Reform education,” said the sagacious Leibnitz, “and you will
have reformed the world.” And it was on this principle that St.
Charles applied himself to the task of reforming, not the world
indeed, but a vast province, in which doctrine and discipline had
alike fallen into decay. To begin with his foundations for seculars,
which were very numerous, the Borromeo College, dedicated to St.
Justina, of which mention has been already made, had been planned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_721"></a>[721]</span>
by him while a student at Pavia, where his own observation of the
disorders prevalent there moved him to make larger provision for
the protection of his fellow-students. In 1572 he founded at Milan
the College of St. Fidelis, in which Humane Literature and all the
higher branches of study were taught, and which was more particularly
intended for the benefit of poor scholars. A second college was
in the following year attached to the church of St. John the Evangelist,
for the education of noble youths. It was under the care
of the Oblates of St. Ambrose, and was commonly known as the
College of Nobles. St. Charles himself drew up the rules both for
the masters and scholars. He marked the time to be assigned to
prayer, reading, and study, and established such a discipline as was
calculated to form a character of solid piety in the most influential
classes of the laity. Next to virtue and learning he desired to see
his noble scholars trained in habits of Christian courtesy, and was
accustomed to insist much on the importance of good manners. He
often visited the school in person, examined the boys at their tasks,
and addressed them some brief religious instructions. Every year,
at the close of the studies, he attended their public literary exercises,
and distributed prizes with his own hand; and so solicitous was he
to perfect this establishment, that he engaged Cardinal Sylvius
Antonianus, his former secretary and a man of rare learning, to
write a work on the education of the higher classes, for the guidance
of those who taught in his College of Nobles. Besides these colleges,
he founded others at Arona, Lucerne, and Fribourg, as well as the
admirable Swiss college established at Milan, for the education of
young Swiss ecclesiastics, which became afterwards the great means
of upholding religion in the Catholic cantons.</p>

<p>For the clergy of his own province he founded no fewer than six
seminaries&mdash;three in his cathedral city, and three in other parts of
the diocese. It must be remembered that the giant evil with which
St. Charles had to struggle was a slothful and corrupt clergy: the salt
had lost its savour, and had to be salted anew. The whole face of
the diocese had to be changed; and such a change demanded a
body of skilful workmen. To create these was his first care, and
with the sagacity of a mind illuminated with something higher than
mere human prudence, he perceived at once that an undertaking so
vast as the creation of a new body of clergy, and the reform of the
old one, could only be grasped by division. He had to classify his
work in order to master it, and in this lay the secret of his success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_722"></a>[722]</span></p>

<p>His first and principal seminary was attached to his cathedral
church, and was intended to receive 150 of the most promising
candidates for the ecclesiastical state. In this greater seminary
dedicated to St. John the Baptist, the students went through a
regular course of philosophy, theology, and canon law.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> But the
second seminary, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Canonica</i>, which was intended for youths
of less ability, who from their good dispositions, nevertheless promised
to make useful parish priests, nothing more was required
than a course of instruction on moral theology, Scripture, the
Catechism of the Council of Trent, and the rubrics and ceremonies
of the Church. A third seminary in the city was set apart to receive
such priests as, either from ignorance or negligence, were found unfit
to discharge their sacred duties, and were placed here for a time to
renew their ecclesiastical spirit, and acquire the learning necessary
for their state. These city seminaries received altogether about
300 students&mdash;a number quite inadequate to supply the wants of
the diocese. Three others were, therefore, added in the different
deaneries, and these were intended as nurseries to those at Milan.
In them were received youths of all ages and ranks of society, principally
those of the poorer classes, who, when properly prepared,
were passed on into the higher schools, all being dependent on the
great seminary of St. John the Baptist as their head.</p>

<p>At first the archbishop supported these establishments at his
private charge, but he was at length obliged to have recourse to the
plan of taxation laid down by the Council of Trent, though this was
only continued until a permanent endowment had been secured.
The rules for their government he drew up himself, placing the care
of their temporal affairs in the hands of four of his clergy, chosen by
himself.</p>

<p>Every student on entering was required to make a spiritual retreat
under the director of the seminary, and a general retreat was made
yearly by all before the opening of the classes. The great object<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_723"></a>[723]</span>
aimed at in every regulation was to train the subjects in the spiritual
life, and to supply them with both the learning and the habits proper
to their state. The care and personal supervision which the archbishop
bestowed on his seminarists, whom he used to call “the
restorers of his diocese,” were rather such as might have been
expected from a father than a superior, and one whose time was
never at his own command. There were few days that he did not
visit the seminary, which occupied one side of his cathedral quadrangle;
it was his wish to receive all new-comers in person, that he
might examine their vocation himself; and when once he had seen
and conversed with them, each one had a peculiar place in his
memory, and became a separate object of his paternal care. Twice
a year he made a visitation of his seminaries, and held an examination
of all the classes. On such occasions he determined those who
were to be promoted to higher classes, and when the course of study
was finished, assigned them offices and benefices, according to the
ability of each. These visitations lasted a fortnight, besides other
shorter ones which he made in the course of the year. One result
of the extreme solicitude he bestowed on the spiritual training of his
disciples was not altogether such as he had anticipated: so many of
his priests evinced an inclination to embrace the religious life, that
he had to solicit from Pope Clement XIII. that some means might
be adopted for keeping them for the service of the diocese;<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> for
every religious order and every bishop were eager to obtain subjects
who had been educated in a seminary of St. Charles. On the other
hand, detractors were not wanting who busied themselves in representing
these colleges as prisons, in which the unhappy students
were worn to death by prayers, watchings, and austerities, by which
means they succeeded in frightening away some who were about to
enter. But the seminarists had but to show themselves in the
streets of Milan to dispel these malicious rumours; their countenances
and their whole deportment being marked with a certain
character of peace and joy, that was recognised as the effect of that
holy discipline under which the whole interior and exterior man was
being formed anew.</p>

<p>St. Charles had now provided for the education of his clergy and
seculars of the upper ranks, but he did not stop there; he had
thought also for the children of the poor; and his plans on this point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_724"></a>[724]</span>
were formed when he was still at the Court of Rome, presiding over
the brilliant academy of learned men which he had formed in the
palace of the Pope, and taking part in the erudite conference of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noctes Vaticanæ</i>. Among the instructions which he gave to his
Vicar-General, Ormanetti, the establishment of poor schools for
teaching the Christian doctrine held a prominent place, and in his
first Provincial Synod he made a special decree obliging his curates
to assemble the children of each parish for catechism on Sundays
and other festivals. By his exhortations he moved a greater
number of pious persons, of both sexes, to interest themselves in the
good work, so that at the appointed hour the churches of Milan
were crowded with catechists and their classes, and it was the good
archbishop’s recreation, to go from one church to another, encouraging
teachers and learners with his presence and his gracious words.
Before he died there was not a parish in his diocese, however remote,
which had not its school; and whereas before his time it was common
enough to meet with persons of advanced age who scarcely knew the
Our Father and the Hail Mary correctly, it was now as common to
find children of ten or twelve perfectly instructed in their religion.
The schools of the diocese were at last entirely placed under the
care of the Oblates of St. Ambrose, that congregation which had
been created by St. Charles, and which he employed as a kind of
spiritual militia for carrying out all his charitable designs. The
discipline established in the poor schools of Milan by their means
was the admiration of every stranger, and the extent of their labours
may be estimated from the fact, that at the death of the archbishop
there existed in his diocese seven hundred and forty poor schools,
two hundred and seventy-three superintending officers, and seventeen
hundred and twenty-six others acting under their orders, having
under their care no fewer than 40,098 scholars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, we may fitly close our studies of the Christian schools.
We have watched them in their infancy springing up under the
shadow of the cloister, and having traced them through their varied
fortunes of good and ill, we leave them at the moment when the
episcopacy was recovering its ancient jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical
seminaries, and when a vast majority of the secular schools of
Catholic Christendom were passing into the hands of a great religious
order, raised up, as it would seem, with the special design of consolidating
anew a system of Christian education. Did we need a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_725"></a>[725]</span>
token that the reforms of the sixteenth century were truly the work
of God, we should find it in that deadly hostility which the enemies
of religion, and the rulers of the world, have never ceased to exhibit
against the seminaries of the Church and the colleges of her religious
orders. And this, not in Protestant countries alone, but under
nominally Catholic Governments, where heretical impieties have been
excluded, only, as it would seem, that there might be set up the
odious idol of the State.</p>

<p>For two centuries at least, education has been the battle-ground
of the Church, and the battle is not yet fought out and finished.
In France, in Belgium, in Germany, and in Switzerland, infidelity
has triumphed exactly in proportion as it has succeeded in substituting
an Anti-Christian State system of education for the system of
the Church, and has never done its work more surely than when its
agents have been philosophic universities, and ministers of public
instruction.</p>

<p>For us in England, who, by a strange anomaly enjoy a freedom
denied to many a Catholic land, and who are called on in one way
or other to take part in the reconstruction of so many of our shattered
institutions, the educational annals of the past have imperative claims
on our attention. It is not for a writer to point the moral of his own
tale; we can but hope, therefore, that our story, however rambling
and diffuse, may yet have been told with sufficient clearness for our
readers to draw that moral for themselves, and to resolve that, in so
far as they may be called on to lend their aid in the great work of
education, they will take no lower models for their guidance than
those that have been bequeathed them by the saints.</p>

<p>And what a calendar is that which belongs to the Christian
schools! The profession of the teacher, which in our day falls, by
choice or duty, on so vast a number, is irradiated by the light which
streams from ten thousand saintly aureoles. If the work be often
wearisome and seem to promise little hope; if the spirit flag, and,
ignorant of those sweet secrets by which the saints kept fresh their
springs of devotion in a thirsty soil, the teacher too often finds his
heart grow dry with incessant labour of the head; if pressed on by
a busy age, be he ever tempted to shorten prayer that he may double
toil, forgetful of the example of those who with one hand only did
the work, while with the other they held the sword;<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> if, in short, the
spirit of the world steal in upon him and assault him with its manifold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_726"></a>[726]</span>
vexations, what can he do better than turn to those who have
gone before him, and learn from their examples, and invoke their
aid?</p>

<p>And what can we do better than commend these pages to the
saints, under whose patronage they were first undertaken; but chiefly
and above all to those,&mdash;too seldom venerated by us, too little loved,&mdash;the
saints and martyrs of England? To St. Bede and St.
Aldhelm, therefore, to St. Boniface, and St. Dunstan and St. Ethelwold;
to St. Edmund and St. Richard, and all who with them have
sanctified our cloisters with their prayers and studies,&mdash;for were not
the studies of the saints themselves a prayer?&mdash;to them in whose
ears the names of our own homes were once sweet household words,
and who, as they listen to the eternal chimes, do not, as we fondly
trust, forget those scenes where, in the days of their sojourning, they
learnt at the springs of heavenly wisdom “the true knowledge of the
things that are;” whose memory has been to us, wandering in the
wilderness, “as the flower of roses in the days of spring, and as the
lilies that grow upon the brink of the waters,”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>&mdash;to our glorious
English Saints we offer these pages as an act of homage due to them
on a thousand grounds, and which, if unworthy of their greatness,
may by its own littleness the better move them to shelter it with their
aid, and may at least bear witness to the grateful love of the least
and humblest of their clients!</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> The ecclesiastical chant took its first great development at Alexandria, and appears
to have been brought thither from Rome by St. Mark. Philo the Jew, a native of
Alexandria, who lived in the time of the Evangelist, describes the Christians passing
their days in psalmody and prayer, and singing in alternate choirs (Euseb. lib. ii. c.
17). On the martyrdom of the Evangelist we read how certain just men buried him
“singing prayers and psalms.” (<em>Vita S. Marci</em>, Sim. Met.) The nature of the chant
established at Alexandria in the time of St. Athanasius, is very precisely indicated by
St. Augustine, in that passage of his Confessions (lib. x. c. 33) where, speaking of the
<em>voluptates aurium</em>, he says that he sometimes desires even to banish from his ears the
sweet tones to which the Psalms of David were generally sung in church; “and then
that method seems to me more safe which I remember often to have heard of Athanasius,
Bishop of Alexandria, who caused the lector to intone the Psalms with so slight
an inflection of the voice, that it was <ins class="corr" id="tn5b" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Double quote added after “more like reading than singing”.">more like reading than singing</ins>.” Hippolytus, in
his Book on Antichrist, declares that one effect of His coming at the end of the world
will be the abolition of the Psalmody of the Church.</p>

whether the Hyppolitus celebrated by Prudentius was ever really Bishop of Porto, and
lastly, whether he was, or was not, the author of the <cite>Philosophumena</cite>. The former
opinion is maintained by Bunsen, Döllinger, and the majority of German and English
critics; the latter is generally supported by the Catholic writers of France.</p>

part in some of the exercises of the catechetical school. St. Clement’s hymn to the
Saviour appears to have been written for his younger disciples. “O Shepherd of the
<em>lambs</em>!” he says, “assemble Thine innocent children, and let their stainless lips sing
hymns to Christ, the guide of youth.” And again: “Fed by the Divine milk of wisdom,
that mother of grace has taught our infant lips, and made them taste the dew of the
Spirit. Let us then sing to Christ our King.... Let us celebrate the praises of the
Almighty Child.”</p>

giving public lectures in his church on the profane poets, and substituting the same in

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> This expression requires some explanation, being an apparent contradiction of what
has been said before as to the Roman origin of the Irish schools. It must be borne in
mind that the error in the Irish manner of observing Easter was not that of the Eastern
Quarto Decimans, as they are called, who kept it on the fourteenth day of the Jewish
month Nisan, on whatever day of the week that might fall. This error was corrected
at the Council of Nice, when it was commanded that the feast should always be celebrated
on the Sunday after the fourteenth day of the moon; and the decree of the
council was obeyed in Britain and Ireland as in Rome. But difficulties afterwards
arose in the method of calculating Easter; the <cite>Cycles</cite>, or periods of years used for that
purpose, were after a time found to be incorrect, and the philosophers of Alexandria
were applied to, to calculate the day and notify it each year to the Pope, who should
publish it to the rest of the Church. Even this plan failed to secure uniformity, and
in the fifth century Rome and Alexandria were to be found computing the time of
Easter after different cycles, Rome using one of eighty-four years, and Alexandria one
of nineteen, which caused the feast to be celebrated on different days. The old Roman
cycle was that which had been introduced into Ireland, and the Irish clergy continued
to use it after it had been reformed in the time of Pope Hilarion, by whose command
the Alexandrian cycle was established as more correct, and the calendar was corrected
by Victorinus of Aquitaine. Such was the disturbed date of the world at this time,
however, that the British and Irish churches heard nothing of this change, and stuck to
their old Roman cycle even after the arrival of St. Gregory’s missionaries. The notion
of the Irish having adopted the Eastern computation of the Quarto Decimans is very
clearly disproved by reference to Bede, lib. iii. ch. 4. They at last adopted the Roman
calendar at the Synod of Lene, held in 630, wherein it was agreed that “they should
receive what was brought to them from <em>the fountain of their baptism and of their wisdom</em>,
even the successors of the Apostles of Christ.”</p>

must fortify themselves with the holy sign of the Cross; and how salutary for every
class of Christian is the daily reception of the Lord’s Body and Blood, which is, you
know, the constant practice of the Church of Christ throughout Italy, Gaul, Africa,
Greece, and the whole of the East.” This is a most important testimony as to the
existing practice of the Church in the eighth century, and Bede goes on to say that to
his knowledge there are innumerable young persons, of both sexes, who might, beyond

that “this great man was degraded by Pope Zachary on conviction of <em>being a mathematician</em>.”
But perhaps the most remarkable reproduction of this oft-told tale occurs
in Dr. Enfield’s translation of Brucker’s “History of Philosophy,” which I give verbatim,
as only to be paralleled in the “Art of Pluck.” “Boniface,” he says, “<em>the patron of
ignorance and barbarism</em>, summoned <em>Polydore Virgil, bishop of Salisbury, to the Court
of Inquisition</em> for maintaining the existence of the antipodes.” (Vol. i, p. 363.) Would
it be believed that a writer who is engaged in bewailing the <em>ignorance</em> of monkish
philosophers should commit himself to a statement which confuses St. Feargil, or Virgil,
bishop of Saltzburg, in the eighth century, with Polydore Vergil, archdeacon of Bath
(for he was never bishop of Salisbury at all), in the fifteenth? And then the Inquisition!
To make it complete he should have identified Virgil with the Latin poet, and
convicted him of the Albigensian heresy. Yet these are the writers who find no terms
contemptuous enough in which to speak of mediæval ignorance. “Among the scholastics,”
writes Dr. Enfield, in the very next sentence, “we find surprising proofs of
weakness and ignorance.” The scholastics, could they speak, might find something to
retort on their accusers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> The doctrines attributed to Virgil, and their condemnation by Pope Zachary, have
been examined by Decker, a professor of Louvain, who shows very clearly that the error
lay, not in their maintaining the existence of the antipodes, but in the notion of a race
distinct from that of Adam. Feller, in the account he gives of the matter in his
Historical Dictionary, refers to the teaching of Bede, who, he declares, denied the
spherical figure of the earth. But the work from which he quotes is not to be found
among the writings of our English saint, whose real opinion on the subject may be seen
from the following explicit passage: “We call the earth a globe, not that it is
absolutely the perfect form of a globe, by reason of the unevenness of hills and plains,
but because its whole compass, if comprehended within the circumference of lines,
would make the figure of a globe.”&mdash;<em>De Nat. Rer.</em> c. xlvi. 118.</p>

this hymn were as follows. Having to sing the blessing of the Paschal candle on Holy
Saturday, he unfortunately lost his voice from hoarseness, and to recover it, invoked the
aid of St. John Baptist, in whose honour he composed this hymn, in which he solicits
him to restore him the use of his voice, and reminds him how at his nativity he had
procured a like grace for his father Zachary. This anecdote explains the allusion in
the opening lines. To avoid the tiresome confusion arising from the similarity of names,
I will remind the reader that there were two persons designated as Paul the Deacon;
one the contemporary of St. Gregory, and the other his historian; and moreover that
he had another historian in the person of <em>John</em> the Deacon, who lived in the ninth

the two sorts of schools. “Traduntur post breve tempus Marcello <em>scholæ

vero, <em>id est canonicæ</em>, Isoni cum Salomone et ejus comparibus.” It is probable however
that the law directing a total separation of the scholars under different masters, could
not in all cases be carried out as rigidly as at the great abbey of St. Gall’s, where the
studium was, in Notker’s time, the first in Europe; and in many monasteries both
schools continued to be directed by the same scholasticus.</p>

in 829 to Louis le Débonnaire, in which they requested him, by his royal authority, to
establish public schools <em>in three chief cities of his empire</em>, to the end that the troubles
of the times might not quite destroy the good work set on foot by his father. But this
was a suggestion and nothing more; the three cities were never named, and are merely
spoken of as <em>in tribus congruentissimis imperii vestri locis</em>; and the deposition of
Louis, and the civil wars that raged between his sons, effectually prevented the suggestion
from being carried out. The academy founded by Charlemagne at Pavia, which
was directed by the Irish Dungal, was itself attached to a monastery. This is possibly
the school alluded to by Bulæus, but there is certainly nothing in its history which
claims for it the least pre-eminence over the monastic schools of France and Germany.
The university historians have, in general, greatly misrepresented or misunderstood the
character of the monastic schools. Du Boulay talks of the <em>public schools</em> of Charlemagne
as if they were Etons or Harrows, and in one place likens them to universities.
But, in fact, the term <em>public school</em> meant simply that they were not confined to the
use of the monks of that monastery, but were open to all comers. We find in them
rather the germ of the <em>collegiate</em> system, which was in some sense the counterpoise of
the university idea. But Bulæus and Du Boulay always write with Paris University in
their mind as the normal principle of education. They seem unable to conceive of any
institution for teaching which was not either its copy or its anticipation.</p>

a commotion with some of his monks. In spite of the pains taken by this writer to
clear up the mistake, the narrative still finds its place in most works which treat of our

<p><a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="label">[118]</a> Among these homilies is that for the festival of Easter, commonly quoted in
support of the audacious theory that the Anglo-Saxon divines knew nothing of the
doctrine of Transubstantiation. The whole question is satisfactorily examined by
Dr. Lingard, in his “History of the Anglo-Saxon Church,” to which the reader is
referred. But it may be observed, that whatever obscurity is to be found in Ælfric’s
language, that of other writers of his nation is singularly emphatic. The very term,
<em>Transubstantiation</em>, is all but anticipated by Alcuin, who, in a letter to Paulinus, bids
him remember his friend “at that time when thou shalt consecrate the bread and wine
<em>into the substance</em> of the body and blood of Christ.” And of two saints contemporary
with Ælfric, viz. St. Odo and St. Oswald, their biographers record the fact, that while
celebrating mass, the appearance of a bleeding Host in their hands removed the doubts
of certain beholders. Yet, what doubts had to be removed if the doctrine were not
then held?</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="label">[124]</a> The battle of Fontenay was gained by Charles the Bald and Louis the German
over their elder brother Lothaire. The latter was totally defeated, and the old Frankish
or Teutonic nobility who supported him were all but entirely destroyed. From this
time the Gallo-Roman element began to prevail in France over the German, and the
treaty shortly afterwards renewed between Charles and Louis at Strasburg, is the first
instance on record of the vernacular dialects being employed on any solemn occasion.
Louis as king of the Germans, swore to the treaty in the Romance language, now
formally recognised as the language of France while the French king took his oath in
Tudesque, or German. On that day, France and Germany may be said to have first
assumed their distinct nationalities. The Romance or Rustic Latin became the
language of France, though this afterwards separated into two branches, that spoken
in the northern provinces, which was more largely mingled with Germanic idioms, and
which was known as the <em>Langue d’oyl</em>, or <em>d’oui</em> and the softer dialect of the south,
which was called the <em>Langue d’oc</em>. Later on, the Italian Romance became distinct
from either of these, and is sometimes spoken of as the <em>Langue de si</em>.</p>

struck at different intervals, gave out the different sounds of the gamut. These intervals
were marked on the chord, and the words to be sung had written over them a cipher,
showing to what interval on the monochord it corresponded. A person therefore could
always set himself right by sounding the note he wanted, as we should use a pitch-key.

<p><a id="Footnote_145" href="#FNanchor_145" class="label">[145]</a> In the year 1867 a controversy arose in Germany concerning the authenticity of the
works attributed to Hroswitha. Professor Aschbach, of the Imperial Academy of
Vienna, in a paper printed that year in the Acts of the Academy, endeavoured to prove
them audacious forgeries; and supposed the author of the fraud to have been one Conrad
Celtes, a Humanist of the fifteenth century. The question was taken up on both sides.
Several distinguished writers and their arguments and investigations appear to have
successfully vindicated the genuine character of the works, and to have established
Hroswitha’s claim to be considered their real authoress. See B. Tenk, <em>Neber Roswitha

the decisions of famous jurists, and this digest received the name of the <em>Pandects</em>.
An introduction, to facilitate the study of the Pandects, with four additional books,
make up the <em>Institutes</em>; and, lastly, certain new statutes added at the revision of the

into the treaty of peace between Count Raymund of Toulouse and St. Louis of France.
The count agreed to pay 4000 marks for the maintenance of certain masters for ten
years; namely, two doctors of theology, two canonists, six masters of liberal arts, and
two of grammar. This foundation was made for the express purpose of combating
the Albigensian heresy in its headquarters.</p>

office. (See Martene, Ampl. Coll. t. ii. 974-979.) But even then the approval of the
bishop or his chancellor was required, and he could claim the right of veto, when
objections to the candidate existed on the score of faith or morals.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_181" href="#FNanchor_181" class="label">[181]</a> Thus we read that W. de Champeaux held the office of archdeacon of Paris, and
governed the cathedral schools. “It had been the rule,” says Crevier, “that all who
wished to open a school should obtain a license from the scholasticus, <em>that is, the
chancellor</em>, of the church in whose territory they wished to establish themselves.” See
also the statutes of Lichfield Cathedral. (Monas. Anglic. t. 3. p. 34.) “Officium
Cancellarii est, sive residens sive non extiterit, lectiones legendas in ecclesia per se, vel
per suum vicarium, auscultare, male legentes emendare, <em>scholas conferre</em>, &amp;c.”
(Quoted by Du Cange.) The chancellor of St. Paul’s, London, had jurisdiction over
all the schools of the city. He was called the <em>Magister Scholarum</em>, and the master
of the cathedral grammar school acted as his vice-chancellor. (Lib. Stat. Eccl. S.
Pauli.) In the reign of Stephen we find an ordinance from the legate, Henry de Blois,
to the effect that all schoolmasters teaching schools in London, without license from
the cathedral scholasticus, should be excommunicated.</p>

is commented on by the statutes of more modern addition, wherein we see the immense
importance attached by the Order to the study of Church history. After speaking of
the study of the Scriptures, it is said: “Another fount of theological science is ecclesiastical
history, which is, as it were, the complement, and ever-living interpreter of
Holy Scripture; so that these two are the <em>duo luminaria magna</em>, illuminating all the
faithful in Christ, and manifesting without a cloud of error, all those truths revealed by
God; for the history of the Church, rightly speaking, is nothing else than Christian
doctrine in act, nor is there any better or more easy way of knowing the Catholic
dogma; for it is nothing else than a series of battles and triumphs of our faith against
the insurgent heresies, which the Church, by her doctors, martyrs, and decrees of
Popes and Councils has successively pierced through and overcome; whence the certain
interpretation of Scripture and the clear explanation of tradition and the authoritative
definition of dogma, are all to be found in the History of the Church.” Const. F. F.

<p>The order of graduation, as it exists at present, is as follows: Eight years of study
are required before any one can be admitted to the degree of Lector, and to obtain this
a student must undergo an examination in Philosophy, Modern Controversy, Scripture,
and the Summa of St. Thomas. The active or teaching course, required for the higher
degrees of Bachelor and Doctor, remains nearly the same as in former days. Various
modifications have from time to time been introduced into the legislation of the Order
on this point, but the principle has always been retained of making a long course of
teaching and repeated examinations the test of qualification. <em>Secular</em> students in a
Dominican College, however, may be admitted to the degree of Doctor after only a
three years’ course of Theology, provided they stand an examination in the Summa;
and by the Bull of Pope Clement XII., all such secular graduates of the Dominican
schools hold the same position in every respect as though they had been promoted to
the Doctorship in the Roman College of the Sapienza. (Fontana, p. 206.)</p>

sawing some stones for the repair of one of the churches, and it chanced that in one
of these blocks there appeared the figure of a head; as of a king, crowned with a
long beard. The countenance had no other defect, save that the forehead was too high
ascending towards the top of the head. All of us who examined it were satisfied that
it was the work of nature. And I being questioned as to the cause of the disproportioned
forehead, replied that this stone had been coagulated by the work of vapour,
and that by means of a more powerful heat the vapour had arisen without order or
measure.” (Op. tom. 2 De Mineralibus. lib. 2, tract. 3, c. i.) The expressions here
used are somewhat obscure, but they seem to imply that Albert knew something of
those phenomena which geologists explain as the result of volcanic heat and the action
of vapour. “Transformed, or metamorphic rocks,” says Humboldt, “are those in
which the texture and mode of stratification have been altered either by the contact or
proximity of an irrupted volcanic rock, or, as is more frequently the case, by the <em>action
of vapours</em> and <em>sublimations</em> which accompany the issue of certain masses in a state of
igneous liquefaction.” (Cosmos. vol. i. p. 236.)</p>

work artificially, and to the women that they might spin fine linen. (Exod. xxxi. 3;

<p><a id="Footnote_244" href="#FNanchor_244" class="label">[244]</a> Nevertheless, oddly enough, the susceptibility to natural beauty and the power of
describing it with the pen is often claimed as one of the good things restored to us by
the Renaissance. The author of Cosmos, in that beautiful Introduction to his work
in which he traces the history of the love of nature, observes that, “when the sudden
intercourse with Greece caused a general revival of classical literature, we find as <em>the
first example among prose writers</em> a charming description of nature from the pen of
Cardinal Bembo.” Had the writer opened any of the monastic Chronicles in which
his own country is so rich, he would have found that the monks, whom Bembo would
have regarded as barbarians, had been before him as landscape painters in words, by
at least six centuries.</p>

verses, full of coarse raillery, composed by its inhabitants, and commonly known
as <em>Fescennina carmina</em> (Hor. Ep. ii. 1. 145). The <em>Theonine tooth</em> is likewise an
expression derived from Horace (Ep. i. 18. 82); and seems to have been a proverbial
expression derived from Theon, the name of a certain Roman freedman, well known
for his malignant wit. (See Notes on Horace by Rev. A. J. Maclean.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_246" href="#FNanchor_246" class="label">[246]</a> If the suggestion to restore the teaching of the Latin prayers and the plain song of
the Church in our parochial schools be deemed preposterous on the ground of its
<em>difficulty</em>, we would simply beg objectors to try the experiment before passing judgment.
A very short experience will prove that with ordinary perseverance nothing is
easier than to make a class of boys recite fluently and chant correctly from note the
Psalms of Vespers or Compline, or the <em>Credo</em>, <em>Gloria</em>, and other portions of the Mass;
and we may add, that nothing seems more acceptable to the scholars themselves.
What was possible in an age when the whole instruction must have been given orally,
cannot have any insuperable difficulties about it in days when every child may be provided
with a printed book. Possibly in a congregation thus trained there might be
fewer complaints than there now are on the score of children behaving badly in church:
for when children understand and take part in what is going on around them, they do
not behave amiss. More valid objections can be conceived as arising from the difficulty
of sparing the time when so many other subjects have to be taught. But what is more
essential to teach Catholics than their Catholic prayers? and what branch of secular
learning will prove a substitute for sound, genuine, and intelligent Catholic Faith?</p>

of a certain scholar, Haldene by name, who was wont to attend the school which,
“according to the known and accustomed usage,” was held in the Church of St.
Cuthbert, at Northam. One day Haldene, who did not know his lessons and was
afraid of the rod, conceived the bright idea of getting hold of the key and throwing it
into the Tweed, so that when the hour of Vespers came no key was to be found. The
example, in far later times, of “Wonderful Walker,” keeping school in his village
church, was therefore but a surviving relic of the primitive manners.</p>

in favour of his being a Dominican is irresistible. He was present at the general
chapter of the Order of Preachers held at Barcelona in 1261; he attended the Provincial
chapter of Montpelier in 1271, and is named in the acts of that council among other
distinguished men of the Order then present. He was discharged from his office of
Provincial in the General Chapter held at Florence, 1272, but was re-elected by the
Provincial Chapter of England the same year. He is described as a Friar Preacher in
the Patent Rolls of Edward I., when the temporalities of Canterbury were restored;
and Nicholas Trivet, the historian of the Order, who lived only fifty years after the
archbishop, distinctly names him as a Dominican. Finally, his name does not occur
in the Catalogue of English Franciscan Provincials.</p>

studuit tam in Oxoniis in regno Angliæ, quam Parisiis.” And again: “Dante se in
juventute dedit omnibus artibus liberalibus, studens eas Paduæ, Bononiæ, demum
Oxoniis et Parisiis, ubi fecit multos actus mirabiles, intantum quod ab aliquibus dicebatur
magnus philosophus, ab aliquibus magnus theologus, ab aliquibus magnus poëta.”

the dominant party against their political opponents. Thus Silvestro de’ Medici, on
gaining the upper hand in Florence, burnt several citizens of note, with their palaces.
And these atrocious cruelties were perpetrated for no imaginable crime, but simply to

whether such a book was preserved at Berkeley Castle (where Trevisa was chaplain in
1387) Dibdin wrote to the Rev. J. Hughes, who filled the same office in 1807, and
received the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have the strongest reason for supposing that such a translation was made in the
English language, and that it existed in the family so late as the time of James I.
The book translated by Trevisa was given as a very precious gift by the Lord Berkeley
of that time to the Prince of Wales, and I have read his letter thanking Lord Berkeley
for the same. He does not positively say that the book was the Bible, but he says he
hopes to make good use of so valuable a gift. This letter is still extant among the
archives of the castle. Lord Berkeley has informed me that the book so given by his
ancestor is at present in the Vatican Library. When he was at Rome several persons
mentioned to him having seen there such a book, written by Trevisa; but as he had no
opportunity of examining it, he cannot ascertain if it were the Bible.”</p>

the “Consolation of Philosophie,” has led some people to suppose that the poet translated
from a French rendering of Boëthius, and not direct from the Latin. If he did
so, the version he would have used was doubtless that of one of his known favourite
authors, Jean de Méung, the continuator of Guillaume de Lorris’s “Romance of the
Rose.” A magnificent copy of Jean de Méung’s Boëthius, printed in 1494, is in the
British Museum. It is illuminated with miniatures, bound in velvet, and was presented
to Henry VII. A chapter of this has lately been compared with Chaucer’s
translation and the original Boëthius, by Mr. Edward Bell, for the Early English Text
Society; and the result is, that Chaucer’s version was certainly not made from the
French of Jean de Méung, but direct from Boëthius; though some phrases of the Latin
are paraphrased rather than translated, in order to bring out their meaning more fully.</p>

Queen Anne during the height of the controversy. Prague University at that time
numbered as many as 60,000 scholars, and was divided into several nations, and presided
over by sixty deans. Only twelve of the deans were Bohemians, and the rest
Germans. John Huss, the rector of the university, who eagerly embraced the new
opinions, endeavoured to destroy the German influence; and putting himself at the
head of a national party obtained that in future the Bohemians should have two votes
in all questions affecting the university and all the other nations united but one. In
consequence of this change, which took place in 1409, the German students forsook
the university, which from that time fell into decay. This <em>national</em> spirit, which was
so largely mixed up with the origin and progress of the Hussite heresy, must be taken
into account when studying the history of those social revolutions which followed in
the track of the new Apostles.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_309" href="#FNanchor_309" class="label">[309]</a> Some curious facts in connection with the proceedings of Pomponius and his
associates have recently come to light. Among other discoveries made by the
Cavaliere de Rossi in the Roman Catacombs, are certain inscriptions left there by the
Academicians, who appear to have made use of these sacred excavations, which were
at that time quite neglected by the literary world, as convenient places in which to
hold their secret assemblies. One of the accusations brought against them by Paul II.
was that they sought to make one of their own members <em>Pontifex Maximus</em>. In the
Catacombs appear several inscriptions conferring this title on Pomponius: <em>Regnante
Pom. Pont. Max.</em>, <em>Pomponius Pont. Max.</em>, &amp;c.; and others, from which we gather that
the <em>unanimes antiquitatis amatores</em>, as they called themselves, were lovers not merely
of ancient names but of ancient manners; and that they saw no disgrace in thus perpetuating
the dissolute habits of their members. It is remarkable that in none of their
writings have any of the Academicians said one word about the Catacombs; for though
they boasted of being the lovers of antiquity, it was only Pagan antiquity which they
regarded worthy of their study: and the Catacombs were simply chosen by them for
their convenient privacy. (See De Rossi, <em>Roma Sutterranea</em>, tom. i.)</p>

which eighty were, he informs us, of authors at that time unknown in Europe. The
Medicean Library, however, was not destined long to survive its noble collector. On
the death of Lorenzo, his son Pietro having become odious to the Florentines in consequence
of his intrigues with Charles VIII. of France, was compelled to fly, the
Medici Palace was sacked, and the great library fell a little later into the hands of the
French soldiery and the Florentine mob, by whom its vast treasures were soon dispersed.
Such portions as could be recovered, however, were afterwards deposited in St. Mark’s library.</p>

Pomponius Lætus, who, along with his other revivals of ancient Roman manners,
caused the comedies of Terence and Plautus to be acted in Rome, in which enterprise,
says Maffei, he was greatly seconded by Cardinal Riario, who opened a theatre in his

command that those who adhere to such assertions shall be avoided and punished, as
men who seek to disseminate damnable heresies.” Moreover, he rigorously prescribes
to all and each of those who give public lessons of philosophy in the universities and
elsewhere, that when they read or explain to their pupils the principles and conclusions
of those philosophers who notoriously wander from the orthodox faith ... “they employ
every effort to set before their eyes the truth of the Christian religion, and persuade

<p><a id="Footnote_337" href="#FNanchor_337" class="label">[337]</a> Knight, in his life of Colet, remarks that “the History and Antiquities of Oxford
sufficiently confess that nothing was known there but Latin, and that in the most depraved
style of the schoolmen.” Yet two pages back he has quoted from Wood an
account of Colet’s university studies, which show that this statement, like many of a
similar import, is grossly exaggerated. Colet, he says, was educated in grammaticals in
London, and then, after spending seven years at Oxford in logicals and philosophicals,
was licensed to proceed to arts, “in which he <em>became so exquisitely learned that all
Tully’s works were as familiar to him as his Epistles</em>.” He also read, conferred, and
paralleled Plato and Plotinus (in Latin translations), and attained great eminence in
mathematics. Erasmus, on occasion of his first visit to Oxford, writes thus to his
friend Pisco:&mdash;“You ask, does our beloved England please me? Nothing ever pleased
me so much. I have found here <em>classic erudition, and that not trite and shallow, but
profound and accurate, both Latin and Greek</em>, so that I no longer sigh for Italy.” In
fact, his own Greek learning was chiefly acquired at Oxford, for previous to his coming
thither, his knowledge of that language was very superficial. Elsewhere, he says, “I
think, from my very soul, there is no country where abound so many men skilled in
every kind of learning as there are here.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_339" href="#FNanchor_339" class="label">[339]</a> Mr. Seebohm’s interesting work on the “Oxford Reformers of 1498” has appeared
since the publication of our first edition. His view of Colet’s character is naturally a
more favourable one than that here given; but in representing him as a sort of Broad
Churchman of the sixteenth century, he sufficiently justifies our strictures on Colet as a
Catholic divine.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_340" href="#FNanchor_340" class="label">[340]</a> Knight, quoting from Antiq. Britan., speaks of his preaching a <em>second</em> sermon after
his interview with Henry VIII., wherein, at the king’s request, he spoke in <em>favour</em> of
the French war. Of this Erasmus says nothing.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_341" href="#FNanchor_341" class="label">[341]</a> To these free views, most Protestant writers, following the authority of Fox and
Knight, have added that Colet was opposed to the practice of Auricular Confession.
This charge is, however, distinctly disproved in his life. Not only did he bear witness
to the comfort and help he himself found in the practice, but in his “Institution of a
Christian Man,” written for the use of his school, he expressly enjoins the frequent use
of confession. ‘Use oft tymes confessyon,’ is one of his “Precepts of Lyvynge,” besides
other directions for the reception of the Sacraments of Penance and Houslynge, in
sickness, and the hour of death. Colet’s strictures, however free, were in fact never
directed against the doctrines of the Church, but only against popular practices of devotion.
The idea of his having set himself against the use of one of the sacraments, so
very welcome to those who would fain claim him as a precursor of the Reformation,
has arisen from a gross misconstruction put upon a passage in one of the Epistles of
Erasmus. That writer, speaking of his deceased friend, says, among other things,
“Ut confessionem secretam <em>vehementer probabat</em>, negans se ulla ex re capere tantundem
consolationis ac boni spiritus; ita <em>anxiam ac subinde repetitam vehementer damnabat</em>”
(Eras. Jod. Jon. Ep. 577). Knight, in his Life of Colet (p. 68), paraphrases this
sentence in the following extraordinary manner: “Though he approved of private
confession, receiving himself a great deal of comfort and inward satisfaction from the
use of it, yet he could not but condemn the popular custom of the frequent repetitions
of what they called <em>auricular confession</em>.” The uninitiated Protestant reader is here
given to understand that <em>private confession</em> was something quite distinct from <em>what
they called auricular confession</em>, and that whilst Colet approved of the one, he
vehemently condemned the other. The plain fact, of course, being that he approved,
practised, and enjoined the right and proper use of the Sacrament of Penance, but
condemned the indiscreet use which may be made of it by scrupulous and weak-headed
penitents. And it is probable that most directors would be of the same opinion.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_342" href="#FNanchor_342" class="label">[342]</a> Fox tells us that Colet sat with some others as judge on certain Lollards, who
were burnt for heresy.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_343" href="#FNanchor_343" class="label">[343]</a> In connection with the name of Ammonius, I cannot help noticing the ridiculous
use which has been made of one of his familiar letters to Erasmus. A native of Lucca,
he suffered much from the inclement English climate, and grumbles about it sadly,
saying, moreover, that the burning of heretics has raised the price of wood. Erasmus
replies in the same vein: “I am angry with the heretics for making wood so dear for
us in this cold season.” The jest was rather a heartless one, yet it was but a jest;
twenty-three heretics had been induced to recant, but no more than <em>two</em> had suffered in
England up to this date of Henry’s reign: nevertheless, Knight, and some other writers,
have made out from this passage the grave historic fact that such numbers were put to
death at this time that <em>all the wood in London was spent in burning them</em>! The fact
is, that Ammonius and Erasmus ceaselessly exercised their wits upon each other, and
all their letters are couched in the same style of banter. Thus Erasmus professing to
instruct his friend how to get on in England, says in the same merry strain: “First of
all, my dear Ammonius, be impudent, thrust yourself into everybody’s business, elbow
every one who stands in your way, give nothing to anybody without a prospect of
getting something better, and always consult your own advantage.”</p>

patronage of Cardinal Morton. Among the grammars enumerated by Erasmus, was
one entitled “Mammotrectus” (or “a boy taught by his grandmother”), a name which,
as we shall see, was sadly out of place in the academies of the sixteenth century.
Before Lily’s time, says Wood, there were as many grammars as masters, and the rules
of one were contradicted in another.</p>

soon afterwards complaining that these authors are being neglected for others of an

Cheke, the classical revival died a natural death, the study of divinity having expired
long before. “It would pity a man’s heart,” says Latimer, “to hear what I hear of

the Church. His friends erected a monument to his memory, which they surmounted
with a bust of the God Terminus, and his fellow-citizens of Rotterdam raised his statue
in their great square, the bronze of which was obtained by melting down a large
crucifix which had formerly stood there. The condemnation of his “Colloquies” by

<p><a id="Footnote_365" href="#FNanchor_365" class="label">[365]</a> The words of M. Olier on this subject are worthy of quotation: “The true and
only superior of the seminary is the bishop, who, containing in himself the plenitude
of that grace and spirit which is to be shed over the diocese, can alone impart to it its
spirit and its life. What the head is to the natural body, the bishop must be in the
mystical body of his clergy, and we should labour in vain did we try any other means
of sanctifying the ecclesiastical colleges. However excellent may be the sanctity
possessed by those eminent and virtuous personages who are to be found scattered
through the dioceses, not having that peculiar and essential grace, that spirit of
headship (<em>cet esprit de chef</em>), which is attached to the sacred character of the episcopate,
they cannot attain the fulness of spirit and of life which is capable of filling and
vivifying the whole body of the clergy: for, according to St. Paul, this must flow from
the head to the members by means of those joints, veins, and nerves intended for the
distribution and communication of life. And these channels communicating with the
Fountain Head are nothing else than the priests united to their bishop, according to the
primitive ordinance of Jesus Christ.”&mdash;<em>Vie de M. Olier</em>, <em>t.</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 354.</p>

divided into two sections, which were to be exercised in the grammar of Emanuel
Alvarez, the Jesuit, the Epistles of Cicero, and some of the works of Ovid and Virgil.
The second class was to be that of the Humanities, also subdivided into two sections,
in both of which the students were to practise an elegant Latin style, and to study
Cicero <em>De Officiis</em>, his epistles to Atticus, and corrected editions of Virgil and Horace.
The Greek grammar of Clenard, a celebrated professor of Louvain, was likewise to be
explained three times in the week. In the Jesuit schools of Milan the Hebrew

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
